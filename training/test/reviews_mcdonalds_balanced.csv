This is the worst Mcdonald I've  ever been to the food is old and the fries is burnt,1
McDonald's foods just suck,1
"Sign on door says drive thru open 24hrs and there is signage under the McDonald's ""M"" by the street that says open 24hrs. They are NOT 24hrs, they open at 5. The lady working inside was annoyed that I was trying to get service at 445 and rolled her eyes when I pointed out incorrect details. Need to fix their information.",1
I tried to dine in at 6:40 pm and they say they are closed like ??????  My guy right at the door it,1
Very bad service .. long waiting time,1
I only get drinks here McDonald's has bad food google there ingredients to the meet beware McDonald's is trying to knock us all off,1
"It is not 24 hours they should update it, 00:06 at night on a Saturday and they did not want to serve us while we were inside because they closed",1
"literally the WORST Mcdonalds Ive ever visited . theyre so lucky you cant give zero . i just came from the location and a guy in front of me waited for 15 mins for a small coffee . then it took them forever to take my order . once i received my food , i asked for a sauce and she told me no because i didn",1
Slower then molasses and never get your order right.,1
The absolute slowest service and homeless everywhere inside. I would never return to this store or advise anyone to come here,1
Mc Don't go here,1
It was McDonald's,1
Vomit and urine from the homeless at the entry turned my stomach and couldnt order food. My wife and I were so turned off we canceled or sightseeing plans in LA and left town. It,1
Terrible,1
"This store is dirty, the staff are rude and stood around talking and on their phones.  Very rude and heard several customer complain.",1
"Terrible service, I think hands down worst mcdonalds I have ever been too. Manager wouldn't even come over to help. Absolute joke of a mcdonalds. Go 1 mile down either way and you will be much happier.",1
This McDonald's does 1 order per hour after midnight ,1
Was horrible. Dry old and nasty. All of us were so disappointed. That's pretty bad when a kid says it was horrible.,1
"NO SAUCE GIVEN!!! I ordered two bts meals and other things and extra bbq sauce but NOT ONE sauce was given. No cajun, sweet chili, or bbq. Had to eat the meals plain. :(",1
Fat burger nasty food,1
"no free refill at this Mc Donald, you have to ask the stuff (!!!) - just one refill is possible, restrooms are closed",1
You got to order at the kiosk!!,1
"This McDonalds is extremely busy and the service is terrible! After waiting for over 10 minutes for my sundae, I finally flagged down an employee and complained. Then she made it. Just a couple of hours previously, I watched someone fill my drink order and put it on a counter where it was subsequently ignored by the other employees who were handing out orders for 5 minutes! They have a computer system just like other McDonald",1
"Horrible customer service! Ordered 2 large fries. They had so much salt on them they were inedible! had to be thrown out . There was even salt on my front car seat! Looked like employee dumped an entire box of salt on them! I live 15 miles away. Took pictures to show manager ""Bridgit"" next time I returned.  She would not make good! Zero!",1
The managers are bad. They get your order wrong most of the time. Do not walk out without checking your bag. 15 minute wait at night. The Filipino manager doesn't know anything and usually have to be reminded by staff. Need to stick to Burger King. These other people posting positive things apparently work there because all you see is people returning with their order.,1
"Supervisor  lady is very bad by her behaviour
She need more training to be a supervisor and learn how to talk with customers .",1
What a bad staff do not hire to eat there,1
This place has no restrooms. I didn't like the service and there's a lot of homeless people in here just to spend the night. I don't recommend this location.,1
This place is dirty and employees don't care. Also homeless hangout here all day everyday. It's a good thing police come here often so they keep crime down.,1
Would not answer me when i called,1
"The chicken nuggets were overly greasy and seemed like they were reheated, and the staff lacked basic customer service skills.",1
This place wasn't the best. The worst food I had the entire trip the soda wasn't mixed well either. I do hope they were having an off day and things get better for them.,1
"Employees always seem bothered by having to work. If you ask for extra of something on your burger, they'll give you none of that and if you take something off they'll make sure you get extra of it... This has happened multiple times now.",1
If I could put nots I would. First off the girl working the drive through got our order wrong. So then when we pulled up to the second window the boy was giving us a ton of attitude. We get our food and the fries are burnt and old and theres no salt on them so they taste old and bland,1
This place has issues every other 3 rd time,1
1 hour wait drive through and the food is bad,1
I just want to warn people that they have a beautiful playground that you can see from the outside...but its closed. ,1
Never get your order right!! And when let them know they got your order wrong... They get mad smh,1
"Two girls at the window were very rude to us and our kids. They asked us to pull around the building but usually if there's no one behind us we say ""we'd like to wait here please"" We know it's all about their timer and restarting it so they say ""look at how fast we got them out""  usually when there's no other car behind us other fast food places say ok but one of the girls at the window kept yelling at us to move. Go to a different one.",1
Wish I could give a ZERO... food was horrible and the whole order was wrong.. paid extra for cheese no cheese no mayonnaise on anything. Food was cold and to top it off the dime size tomatoes on each sandwich 7 sandwiches and 2 were right.. cant post the pictures on here or I would.. service unacceptable,1
"I know McDonalds is not a gourmet sandwich
But I got a crispy chicken that was chicken and bread. Nothing else. A chicken in a dry bun",1
Here I ate my last Mac hamburger of my life. It is a promise. Never more,1
Terrible,1
It's called fast food for a reason and there is nothing fast about McDonald's in key west. The staff is rude and there hasn't been one time they have gotten my order correct.,1
"Loud speaker at drive thru ""Due to technical difficulties we're closed."" Yet someone is getting served right in front of me?? There's a reason yall are called crackdonalds and nobody goes to yall anymore.  Thought with WAWA opening up across the street this would change,  guess i was wrong for trying.",1
Terrible,1
They booted my car.  Wouldn't takenit off without paying $80 cash only.  Shady place.  Beware - don't park or eat here.,1
Worst customer service ever!!!,1
They mess with your food here!!!,1
"This location is a horrible store to work for. The General Manger Omar Delgado  doesnt know how to run a store efficiently. The Supervisor, Eduardo doesnt care how its ran either.  As someone who used to work here at the Manger ",1
"Every single time I order on Uber eats or DoorDash or even go to the Drive thru, part of my order is missing. I call to speak to the manager and all I get is attitude. This is an issue as not always do these delivery apps refund you.  Or to drive back isnt something you can always do.

As someone who was manager at one of the top McDonald",1
I ordered from here twice and I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and onions and the first time they didnt even put the bacon on it (The bacon that I spend my money on) and now they didnt put the onion on it.,1
App orders are horrendously slow. Expect to walk in and inquire about it.,1
False advertising. Drive through is open 24 hours. Diner closes at 10!,1
"Very dirty.  Cold food.  Somebody peed in the play area.  Management was informed, but nobody cleaned it up.",1
"Bad service i know we go in to this pandemic and it is rug times,we need to be aware that there is people traveling and one stop for food be more polite to costumers dont make us fill bad for our food we are working and try to help busyness dont be rude to us",1
McDonald's is the worst food you can feed to your kids and for yourself the burger  bun so hard it Crack your teeth by the time you get to your car the food is cold  and McDonald's has the same menu from the 80s and 90s you better off cooking at home and with this inflation nobody has money ,1
"Overcrowded and rude employees when we went. Overhyped in my opinion. Just browse the pictures on the internet and call it good.  Theres no need to visit this place. Smaller jungle gym than we thought and too overcrowded with kids shoving each other and climbing over each other. We wanted to try the pizza but they closed shortly after we arrived. Mind you, it was open when we first arrived but we had to wait in a ridiculously long line only to find out they closed while we were waiting and",1
Don't get the breakfast burritos they advertise a nice beautiful looking burrito on their menu and then when you get it it's a quarter of the size of which they advertise the price has gone up on these and the quality has gone way down they have false advertising on their menu,1
"Do not order here,  the fries were only full and they didn't give me any of my sauces very dissatisfied. When I called at 2:30 am the lady who answered was so rude!!!!",1
Horrendous service...was on drive thru for 10 minites...didnt move...went inside...took 15 minutes for 2 shakes and a fry...order was wrong...was ignored when i told them order was wrong..pretty hard to offend this new york guy...worst McDonald's i have ever been in!!,1
Ordered a 10 piece nugget meal only for 8 nuggets.,1
I'm currently in the bathroom. There is no toilet paper and nobody answers the phone when I call. This isn't a joke. I'm very serious. The dispenser has a slot for 2 rolls. Neither of which are filled. Careless. Hopefully someone reads this in the next couple seconds and helps me out. Again. This is not a joke whatsoever. I'm very serious. I'm upset and running late for a gathering.,1
"Really frustrated with this location. I usually go to the location off of Beach street and order the same thing every time I go there. I know exactly how much my order should be. I stop here because I happened to be closer to this location than to my normal one and order my usual. 2 McDoubles. I had just enough change in my wallet to pay for my order. Or so I thought. Instead of paying $1.50  2 + .25 = $3.25, I was charged $1.99 for ONE Mcdouble. It may not seem like much, but to someone who is on the go and on a budget I expect ome of the biggest fast food chains to at the very least be consistent with their prices. I wonder how much I've over paid at this location in the past!
What made me most upset was that I didnt recieve a receipt for my order. So in order to determine why I paid $2.15 after tax for ONE Mcdouble, I went inside to the self ordering in the lobby and looked it up myself. I dont appreciate not being told my total at the speaker, not beinzing I didnt even receive one to begin with when I pulled forward from the pick up window. It should be standard procedure to give a receipt for the sake of the overpaying customers.",1
Food sucks never right always I mess up and cold and old French fr,1
"They are lazy and rude, and in my opinion racist only happier to serve their race.",1
Always come here but today I went thru the drive through and encountered a woman who looked like a manager training a young man or something like that. Both of them extremely rude and condescending. 11/17/22 9:26am transaction amount 4.24 side one,1
Good food. I waited 15 minutes for one bacon cheeseburger. The store is very sloppy it look like a hurricane came through. They were understaffed. I deserve a free meal for that experience.,1
Food is fine just dont walk outside as the area is filled with odd characters and not safe. Inside are people sleeping in the restaraunt and staff doesnt care so drive thru is recommended!,1
Longest line ever.  And k only wanted fries and oreo mcflurry,1
Flavorless grease bombs. This chain in general has gone down hill in a big way.,1
"This place is terrible!  They have no inside seating...  which, I guess happens.  But the manager on duty this morning, when asked about the seating simply waved my wife off and shooed her away without even taking her cell phone from her ear...   shameful...  we just wanted to have a quick bite before getting on the road on the tail of the tropical storm.  The one bright light was the very sweet and friendly young lady that took our order.   Wish I knew both names so that I call them out, both good (for the young lady) and BAD (for the manager lady on duty).",1
Severely understaffed for such a busy location. I've seen McDonald's with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere. Expect to wait at least an hour for food and make sure to check your order before leaving as I and at least half of the patrons I saw leaving came back missing something.,1
Never get your order right!! And when let them know they got your order wrong... They get mad smh,1
"Dirty, slow, no vegan options at all",1
"The worst McDonald's I ever been too. Not enough workers and, waited 40 minutes on my food, and the order was wrong. This is suppose to be FAST FOOD.",1
Just left McDonald after a wait of 20 minutes and left with nothing. We made order milk shake and icecream and when we reached the window. She said the machine is down and I forgot to tel you because I was busy.,1
I went to this store last night (Oct 28) and one of the managers visible from the drive thru window wasnt wearing his mask. Very unsafe,1
"If Mc D thinks Kiosk service is the future, I would SELL My Stock!
Probably the Worst Mc D experience I have Ever had...",1
Horrendous service...was on drive thru for 10 minites...didnt move...went inside...took 15 minutes for 2 shakes and a fry...order was wrong...was ignored when i told them order was wrong..pretty hard to offend this new york guy...worst McDonald's i have ever been in!!,1
Probably the worst run mcdonalds Ive been to in a long time. Workers are sloppy and food comes out crazy slow.,1
"Ew omg, the coke is so disgusting, it does not taste like coke, it taste so disgusting, and they take their time like i don't have a 30 minute lunch ",1
"I'm not one to just say only something negative but for the life of me I can't find anything positive. This branch is the slowest I have ever been to . It never gets my order right , no matter how simple I made it. The burger's condiments were all wrong . The fry's were old as hell and the unsweet tea tasted old and sour.  Definitely no going there again no matter how desperate.",1
I walk into the store in Roanoke TX and the employee is sitting on the counter and leaning on the cups with his but touching them I wonder where else he's been sitting at maybe where the food is made.,1
"4 consecutive weeks, Every Monday the dining room is not swept or mopped. They don't open at 530am. For the last month on Mondays they won't have orange juice. They say the machine doesn't work and they can't serve it. The cashier tells me Some other worker will squeeze the orange because it's freshly squeezed. I would understand one mistake, but it's occurring every Monday.",1
Blah. The iced coffee I got just so my kids could go in the play place tasted like dish soap. Unhealthy food. Avoid.,1
"The male cashier was lazy and rude and tried to charge me the higher prices. The 2 hamburgers I ordered were cold , COLD . Worse, they did not contain the extra pickles I requested 3 times! Yes 3 x. The 2 Apple pies were not only cold ...but ,worse, had been clearly sitting out all day and were so over cooked,  I just  spit them out and into the garbage;  less than 1 bite.
The chicken sandwich was not hot either  and worse , it was waaaay overly smeared  with unhealthy  mayo which  I threw away so as to not suffer food poisoning. It was by far the worst fast food restaurant experience ever in my life and it cost me a whopping  9 dollars and 93 cents. I WANT A REFUND PLEASE.

FINALLY ,this crowded McDonald's  was the filthiest and dirtiest one I've ever been in.

So very very sad and disappointed.

Respectfully submitted,

Timothy Ernest.",1
I entered to the restaurant and immediately a black guy with black clothes told me with a rude attitude that I need to buy something. I tell him that's ok then It watching the Menu and 3 minutes later the same guy with a rude attitude again and raising his voice told me that if I do not buy anything right away I need to leave the building. By far the worst experience in a fast food at my Life.,1
Bad service and some of the cashiers have a nasty attitude.,1
"Worst McDonald's experience  ever.  Silent 25 mins in drive thru.  When ordering we were advised could not sub drink in meal with McFlurry and had to purchase separately.  When finally making to window to pay, they couldn't 'find' my order.  For this to be in a Prime location in Orlando,  they completely failed the meaning of fast food.",1
Made an order online. Arrived 15 later. The place was packed. We waited 50 minutes in the store for our food. We got the wrong nugget sauces. We were missing 2 LG fries and 2 LG sweet t's. The manager behind the counter was very rude to the customers. This place is a wreck.,1
Just because the kiosks were there they didnt wanna help. I couldnt access the order I wanted so I went to the front tried to tel them 3 times but they didn,1
Worst McDonalds Ive ever been too. The disrespectful teenager that brought my food to my car was slow and never spoke a word ,1
disapointed ,1
"Really slow service, took over 15 minutes to receive the food,  after it had been delivered to another table.

When it did arrive, the chicken and burger were cold. Duly sent back, to be fair they were remade and brought pretty quick, but no apology.",1
"Totally, not worth it. I've received better service and food at standard McDonald's locations. The prices are ridiculously high for a McDonald's, the people are ghetto, and the facility could have been a lot cleaner.",1
Bullshit,1
Terrible,1
Very Bad experience. I was harassed by managers Named Rocio and Roberto. They brought a negative experience and were screaming at customers and employees...,1
Inside counter served all takeout orders before any dine in customers. Watching customers that ordered over 10mins after myself get theirs first. After getting the food the fries and Big Mac were both ever under cooked. This place shouldn't even be open,1
"I ordered a caramel frappe with no whip cream. Upon getting my Carmel frappe there was whip cream. They were upset when I requested they fix my order to meet the way I ordered. When they handed it back to my husband, they had scooped out the whip cream and another quarter of the frappe. Very rude about it as well.",1
"Staff was very rude, not the one at the counter but the manager was yelling at me to come get our food. Me being pregnant and just visiting the zoo, I was letting my husband get the food after he was finished getting the kids drinks as the lady continuously yelled at me to get my food! Very unprofessional.",1
"Employees have a disgustingly rude attitude, literally EVERY TIME..and I haven't been there often. It was purely out of convience ie. on my way to my job and I need to eat or grab a terrible cup of coffee. Basically desperation smh on my part. So I'll digress they're all rude, they make mistakes and then they basically have an ""oh well, not my problem attitude, very stingy with sugar/sweetener, they also serve  cold food or buns without the beef smh",1
They offered no beverages. They were out of stock. Seriously.,1
The very poor and unsatisfactory customer service reflects the equally subpar food products being sold here. I pray to see the day this franchise leaves this earth like the black plague.,1
The people at the window were rude and they were out of everything! And waited in line for 30 min and then was told that they were cash only!!!!,1
"Worse McDonald's I've been to. I have decided to go a mile further to the Augustine Dr one instead at this point. Constantly slow, missing items or not making them correctly. Ordered for curbside at 8pm, was told restaurant was closed and I need to contact corporate for a refund",1
Bad service... 30 minutes to get my order and it was incomplete,1
The diner was dirty and so was all the tables and I dont want to mention the restrooms were smelly and dirty there was two teenagers on their cell phones wasting valuable Time,1
"Worst McDonald's ever, sat in the drive thru (2)  for over 10 minutes while the first drive thru the orders were being attended and the second drive thru was ignore, and I finally drove up to place the order and my order was wrong like always worst experience ever bad management.....",1
They hire unprofessional people who can't even speak proper English. The workers are always forgetting something in your order. Ohh and the ice cream never works!,1
"They have a security guard who has the key of the restroom and he thinks he owns it he got upset because I was holding the door for my friend to use it cuz he was waiting too as I did ,the security guard doesn't come until 7 am so if you buy something before that you are not able to use the restroom until he comes ,the bathroom doesn't look from inside means that anybody can open the restroom while you still using it, he also was arresting us cuz my friend took a little bit longer in the restroom and he ask me if my friend smokes I think that unprofessional!",1
Boooooooo,1
So bad customers service  ...... we were here for a business trip ... we don't want to order on the machine so we ask the guy to help us and he refuse to do so.... So bad that I'll no come back again... I it was kind a cold I hope not cold heart .,1
"Rude customer service, unprofessional attitude, overcooked food, no complimentary items for screwing up our orders. I don't understand how you can keep your job when there is so many negative reviews. I vow to never eat here again. I would rather eat a cold can of baked beans...",1
We could not believe but at this location they charged us for a coffee US$3.75. Very bad neighbourhood and employees  are just to avoid.,1
"DO NOT GO! As soon as I got in, I got yell at by one of their employees to get out and go to through the drive thru. I told her I did not have a car and she told me to wait in the line anyways. I standed in the line for cars and they took forever to make any orders. After  my order was done, they made me wait on the sidewalk and let other cars go ahead of me just because I was not in a car. The two cars behind me had bigger orders (I am talking 2/3 delivery bags). They yelled at me, they basically threw the food at me and I left with the worst experience. Is not fast food if you have to wait 30 minutes just to order.",1
"Waited 34 minutes to pick up our order, and of course it was wrong and cold. Poorly managed, I do not recommend this location.",1
add a maintenance person was very rude to me told me I was in his way and I Curtis Lee moved out of his way on purpose then you got a big guy coming up with no uniform or anything asking me if I got a problem it's not a good place,1
"The worst, dirty",1
They were very slow and it took me 20 min to get my food in the drive threw and they ain't prepared and on top of there orders they slack off (bad review),1
"Food was ok.
For service I would give 0 if I could. Rudenessted with the manager and continued with the staff. Everyone seemed very bothered to be there. Asked for an extra napkin and nobody would bother to respond.
The bathroom was apparently out of order for customers but seemed to be working just fine for the staff as they kept using it.",1
I'm here,1
"& then they complain they get paid min wage. I'm aware this is a fast food place, so I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but the service here is extremely slow. The staff have no customer service. Avoid this place, unless you are literally in love with waiting",1
didn't speak english and messed up order (even after she double checked) and two other people in line had the same problem. honestly 0/5,1
They never get your order right not even when you tell em at the counter NO CHEESE..IDIOTS,1
"Waited almost 30 minutes to get my food, while people with bigger orders that came after me, got their food. When asked what was taking so long, they said they are working on the order, then followed by asking me what my order was. After wards, had another employee who knew what was going on come out to ask me again what order was, had to stand there and watch them put my food into a microwave. The worst experience ever.",1
Sick of the long wait. Every single time I come here it's the same woman running the register. 10 minutes to order food. 10 minutes to get my food. Get a crew that actually works. Or get an ow we that actually values CUSTOMER SERVICE.,1
"This is by far the most unprofessional , location I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. The staff as a whole are lazy and not at all interested in customer or service. French fries taste like they were cooked hours before being served fountain drinks taste like bath water only slightly warmer. Hours are mis-posted on the entrance door and for serving product that is already cooked and just sitting under the heat lamp they are in a league of their own when it comes to the slowness of their service. I will gladly drive twenty miles out of my way to avoid this location in the future.",1
Very rude staff nasty attitude  I understand  people not happy with their job  but that dobt give them the right to be nasty..,1
VERY Rude gentleman that works at McDonald's.  Shorted me of my food 2 times in a row. Very bad attitude!!!,1
"So a place like this with no bathroom or any sort of facility to wash your hands before eating
Not even a hand sanitizer
What kind of planning is that ?!",1
"Ordered mobile and drive through. They gave me the drive through order and then made me turn around and wait in behind multiple people again for the mobile order of a mcchicken. While waiting, I realized my first order was two sandwiches short. This used to be my fav McDonald",1
"Security kicked us out because ""it was past 5 o'clock, dinning room closes at 5 and he doesn't get paid OT.
Staff were chuckling that we were upset.",1
The service was very slow today and they messed up the order. The fries were old and hard. They were cold,1
One because everytime I go early in the morning this lady is always so rude. Granted I know its early but if u can't handle being up this early then maybe you should consider getting a different job. It's not okay to be rude.,1
Terrible,1
Not open 24 hours apparently. Came by marathon Sunday morning only to be told it was closed by security.,1
I waited over a half an hour just to get to the order window for the drive thru at 12:30 in the morning,1
"Raw burger. Spoke with manager Nattie, she defended the raw burger saying it passed a temperature check. She reluctantly agreed to make a new one a took my receipt.  20 minutes later still no burger. Went to the counter, a girl there gave the burger to someone else. Another burger was made, but they ""lost"" the receipt.  While standing at the counter waiting for a receipt to be reprinted, I was holding onto my bag. A man behind the counter tried to grab the bag out of my hand. I told him ""hands off"", he said he was checking the order number. TOTAL INCOMPETENCE! I went to complete the survey on the receipt BUT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED!!!",1
Only thing good is the fries....and please bring the orange hi-c back!!!,1
Didn't let me use my coupon,1
"Hawaiian Court location -
Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the ""Fast Food"" label.
From order to recieving the food, it took 42mins, and even then the order came out wrong.
There was one manager, one fry cook and one burger cook, trying to complete a dinner time rush, yet there were 3 cleaning staff going round cleaning 1 table every 20mins or so.
This team could really do with some logistical training on how to get orders out efficiently and on time, because this really was a poor attempt at ""fast food"".",1
I had to wait 25 minutes for a breakfast sandwich service very slow there and most of the food I've gotten from there since then has been cold,1
I went there two times with bad experiences. Both time the automatic cashier was out of paper. You are calling assistance to have your number of order and they dont care. They serve your coffee black even of you asked to add cream in the order. Looks,1
"Ordered a buy one, get one sausage egg and cheese biscuit , went home, rook an hour or longer ONLY to discover there was NO cheese on either biscuit!!!!! I'm  a cheese lover, so this really furiated me! PLEASE DO BETTER!!!!!",1
Take to long and they don't get your order right  employees to slow and on there phone joking and laughing,1
"If I could give it zero I would. Your MANAGER is RUDE. Someone ordered breakfast at 1050am, she said no more breakfast. I said ""there is no more breakfast?"" She said out loud, in front of customers ""ends at 1030, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT"" No everyone DOESNT know that, some serve it 24/7. She continued to berate me.",1
Took 29 minutes in the drive thru for 2 McDoubles and a happy meal. At 7pm.,1
I ordered a coke and got a dr.pepper. this is the 2nd time that they have done this.,1
"Epic McDonald's on International dr. Is lacking customer service.  Had the coupon for free Happy Meal from Visit Florida.  They didn't want to give it to us because we downloaded from site and printed not from tourist booklet.  Then said it was not actually for a happy meal.  Just drink, fries, and burger/nuggets. "" No box, toy, yoghurt or toy""  even though the coupon stated ""HAPPY MEAL""  no small print.  Girl at drive thru wasn't nice.  Prices at epic McDonald's are quite a bit higher than the other locations and no $1,2,3 menu",1
Very bad service. Staff discriminate homeless even if they are paying for the food. Its time to realize that people should ,1
Rude employees,1
"Worst experience! All I asked for was a regular size coffee.I get to the window and was handed a small , I asked the woman if that was a regular to which she rudely said yes I questioned her again two more times then I asked her how many sizes of coffee they had she said small medium and large I asked her which one was the one I was holding and she said it's a small that's what we charged you for she said, and I told her I asked for a regular which would be a medium but I just drove off. Also asked for 3 splendas and 4 creamers on the side and received 3 regular sugars and 2 creamers. To top it off, coffee was full of coffee grounds to the point I was spitting them out. And as a little plus there was a piece of plastic! Never again!",1
Miyra is extremely rude and slow. Acts like she hates her job. Took 30 minutes to get an egg McMuffin and hash brown,1
Unfriendly employees! Google said 24/7 - they were impolite and kicked us out before we could order and we were in line,1
"I never ever go here because it's the most incompetent McDonald's I've ever seen operate. I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was 17 so I know a thing or two about the process and how it's really not rocket science but somehow they can't ever get it right. Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it. I would be embarrassed to own this place. Don't go here... I know it's fast food and we shouldn't expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints. Trust me it's worth the drive.",1
"The fries were too greasy and the bread was disgusting. Watch out for the homeless people! One of them gave me a wedgie while i was waiting in line for my food. thank you

From ~ BigMamaPimp",1
"Disrespectful Employees, piss-flavored nuggets, somebody forgot to flush the toilet avta they've tooka SHET, my a**h** is nicer than this restaurant.",1
"2 people working, 1 learning how to work, and two cleaning, instead of helping the line of drive thru cars and 8 people waiting inside to place their order. Took a half hour to get two cheese burgers, two fries, and two drinks at 10:30 at night. And that was only half of what we ordered, so we left.",1
"Customer service is bad, they were super slow. They did not complete my order and when I asked them for the rest of the stuff, no apology when they handed it to me.",1
I required some hot water for my parents but they wanted to charge me for a tea. This could be no problem as a routine. Just make me somewhat uncomfortable.,1
"Bad food and service the soda is flat, and good is horrible and I've never met such ghetto personel",1
bad service and very dirty inside !!,1
No restroom bad service,1
I mean it's McDonald's what can you expect,1
"Horrible!! It's cool that this McDonald's is a 24hr restaurant, BUT it's almost midnight with only one other customer and here I am, still waiting over 20+ minutes now!?? How slow can they be!? I can see 4 workers in here but that still don't explain this wait! These workers' sense of urgency is not there at all... Not even moving with any purpose! Maybe that is JUST the ""night""... So I hope.",1
Their food sucks,1
The worst McDonald's to get breakfast really early in the morning I always go try to get breakfast around 4 in the morning and there card reader is never working I don't understand how every day at 4 a.m. they can't accept debit or credit card this is been going on for a very long time,1
The morning shift is very racist and racially profiling,1
"No shakes or ice cream again, and no sign to inform. Long lines only to learn they do not have what I stopped in the purchase. ",1
"Poor service, no hair net covering hair and no gloves. I witnessed one lady fixing a Customer order of nuggets with no gloves on.",1
"The worst McDonald's I've been to! Went in around 10 maybe 11 at night after visiting disney on the way back to our hotel. Went inside because the drive through line had at least 10 cars, no big deal. I was ordering a carryout. Anyways they forgot the chicken nuggets for the 10 piece chicken nugget meal. I wasnt about to bring my two little ones back out so I called the store. I told them what had happend and said I would be back sometime tomorrow afternoon and to just get it then (my boys love McDonald's) she said that would be fine and she would be there the next day. I asked her name but it couldn't really understand what she said because she was talking fast. Anyways I go back the day and told the lady at the drive through what happend, she didn't know what to do and had to get a manager the manager comes on and asks who I spoke to and I told her I didn't remember but she said to bring my receipt in and she would take care of it. Manager didn't believe me. I ended up just buying another one and I know its literally only a few dollars but it was the principal.",1
they have maggots,1
Bad exsperence two days in a row no mc rib! Drive through slow no matter what time i go there. Fries old on several different occasions. Isaac the night manager was sweet!,1
"This McDonald's screws up 96% of the time! Tonight was the last straw. My husband ordered 2 large fries, 2 PLAIN McChickens, and 2 large drinks.....The drinks were great.....the rest was not even what he ordered and OLD. In the bag was a fillet o fish (which to my surprise was the only fresh thing), 2 medium 5 year old fries, and 2- 10 year old cheeseburgers...seriously, the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting. Where is the quality????? They don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it. Way to go McDonald's for providing POOR SERVICE yet again.",1
"Whatever you do, do NOT go to this McDonald's location. There's a reason why I rated it one and I can kindly explain why. While the food there is good, I simply cannote at these people the same way anymore. A hour or two ago, I showed up to get some food and there was this one woman working behind the register (I don't remember her name, but I assume she was a manager or something. She was in a blue shirt and glasses and that's all I can remember). There was an annoying beeping sound that seemed concerning and I politely asked (key word here is ""politely"") them to investigate it and make it stop. They didn't bother to check it, which shows that they're neglectful of the resources around their workplace. The reaction I got from this woman was 100% disrespectful and told me to get out of her store and never come back and even tried to call 911 on me. It's pretty obvious that I caught this woman on a bad day. Clearly, I was furious because I felt like she was deliberately trying to get under my skin and using that to her advantage. You know what they call people like her? A bully. I was bullied by the manager because I had a concern that needed to be addressed. I was not trying to show up on this woman at any point during my visit. I was trying to be as lenient as I possibly could. If the woman I was referring to was actually a manager of this establishment, she needs to be put in her place because that's NOT how a manager should treat her customers. I do not like being antagonized, especially by an employee and it really showed during this visit. Come to think about it, I've been checking on other reviews of this location they all had numerous problems with this particular person. Obviously, I'm heartbroken because now I don't have anywhere to go to eat after my work shift. I'm only relegated to the Chick-Fil-A a minute down the road and even I know they have better hearts and respect than this woman did (and their food is also good). As a man diagnosed with autism, I strongly advise people to stay away from this location at all costs. If you really need to go to a McDonald's, steer clear of this location. It's not worth your time and it's not worth your sanity. Also, their drink machine has been broken and flat for at least a few months and they didn't fix that either. I will be contacting corporate about the antics going afoot at this location.",1
Raise all their prices due to the Convention center. Some sandwiches raised by $3. As a company this large they should be able to keep the prices lowered rather than ripping off all the people in the area.,1
Not good waited to long for food and then the order was wrong..,1
Waited in drive thru for 20 minutes had to go in to get our order.manager was great but they had everyones order messed up.,1
It sucked the people did not make my order correctly and kept rushing me,1
"Terrible services, long wait times.",1
Could you update the lobby hours? It seems to change every two weeks. With the pandemic going on the least you can do is not waste anyone's time.,1
They never have anything on the menu they're rude and really slow,1
They were very  rude,1
"Rude staff asked the manager about the birthday grimace promotion and she said ""I don't know"" and walked away.",1
Orange juice add water..no taste n water flavor?? Water x extender juice..chiring... cheaper..not respect x costumer..then  server say I don't know..not take responsibility..not good,1
I order 2 happy meal nt given apple juice and didnt give ,1
This McDonald,1
This people don't even acknowledge that you are standing there waiting for them to take your order,1
My hash brown had sooooo much grease that it soaked through the bag. GROSS!!!!!! I'll never get food from this location again!!!!!!!,1
"Came in and ordered a Large coffee w/no ice. They handed me a cup that was less than half way full. I asked the employee, Flor, if they could give me a Large coffee w/no ice and she said no. I was willing to pay more to get a full cup of coffee. I always get a large sweet tea w/no ice and it",1
How can they have about 20 employees behind the counter and run into stock issues. Everything is sold out. Poor management I say.,1
"Sun Dec 11, 2022 at 5: 30am, went to pick up a order lady was being very rude telling me to get out of her drive thru when all I said was I have a order to pick. Very unprofessional.",1
It's breakfast sandwiches are human meat,1
Awful,1
"I ordered breakfast with no line and took 10 minutes to tell me they didnt have that breakfast item available. There were about 10 employees not really that busy. So I said ok to something equivalent in cash value. Then, they had an issue getting a mocha coffee out due to some poor understanding of the machine. So after fifteen minutes I left my food on the counter and walked away before Ited yelling at a manager. I dont like to do that but just reaffirms that this particular McDonald",1
Who idea was it to destroy the famous zoo McDonalds ??? I hope revenue sales go down the drain.,1
Busiest McDonald's ever.  Plan on 25-30 min to get food.,1
One hour in drive thru at night ridiculous they said they don't do curb side after 10pm ridiculous then don't make us wait an hour for an order of fries,1
Nasty Shift manager and drive thru lady treat customers like a burden nonsense of customer service. Kitch n always Dirty. I definitely would not suggest coming here.,1
"My order # was 1471. Simple order. Big breakfast with extra sausage
No utensils, no syrup, no extra sausage.
So I call. Nina said she was the manager. But transferred me to Bri. Told Bri what happened and she said she would talk to the crew. So I explained that does not help me. I still dont have what I paid for. She asked how she could help. I asked her to hang on while I answered another phone. Instead she hung up. Few minutes later I called back. Now no one will answ",1
Terrible,1
This is my second visit and it's even slower and longer than my first. Unbelievably long wait times in the drive through.,1
"The expression on the clerk's face is like you owe him a lot of money. There are many homeless inside and outside the store, and the dining environment is very bad.",1
"I needed a pick me up and stoped by for some iced coffee. Since I am diabetic , i can only have regular  cold coffee with milk , no flavored milk . Still i had to pay full price for a med cold coffee  (with only 3 ice cubes I wished for ) came out for almost 2 $ ! I think this is pretty unfair , overpriced and pure profit ! So I am not ever going to buy anything from Mc.Donald anymore .",1
Terrible 30 minutes in drive thru . Drink was wrong and sandwich was wrong.,1
Always has disgusting smelly homeless people lying around,1

"Wow!  To say that we had a bad experience would be a compliment.  The food was cold, they ran out of ice and carbonation--yes, no carbonation for the sodas!!...and they still kept serving them--we counted at least 10 returned drinks in a10 minute spam.  Worst of all, the manager offered no apologies.  Run, don't just walk away from this place!",1
"This retailler,slow and mix up orders,no maners from staff,ongoing.",1
People need to double check your order before you leave...bad service..,1
"The general manager of this location had the worst customer service I have ever experience! I order food , it was cold. He initially didnt wanna give me fresh food or a refund, I sat at the drive Thur almost 30 minutes waiting . Once he seen I wouldnt leave he gave me back partial payment and then called the police on me. I ",1
"I move close to this unit, ordered via app to avoid the drive thru line, but for my surprise when I went to get my order that was ready I was forced to take an hour in the drive thru line.

This is supposed to be fast food.

When I went to pick up my order, the drinks were wrong, the potatoes were the wrong size and old, the Sundae machine was broken, they didn't deliver our sundaes and the attendance was super rude, saying that the problem was mine and not hers, burgers were in the correct Double Quarter Ponder box but when we got home, there were cheeseburgers and the third burger wasnt in the bag!!

The amount charged on my card by the Mc Donalds app was greater than the closing of the order.

I made a complaint to customer service that notified the unit but unfortunately no concrete action will be taken.

Never had a more disappointed experience estaurant again!",1
"Sat at the drive thru for 10 minutes. Called TWICE to ask if they are even open. Rudely told ""uhh yea?"" okay well HOW ABOUT YOU DO YOUR JOB? Pulled up to the window after 10 minute , THE LADY WON'T EVEN LOOK AT US, butts helping drive thru customers. Hello??? Pulled off. Ghetto af.",1
This place has changed a lot.They forget about your order or forgets certain things in your order.Now there are more homeless's.Now there are teenagers working there and messing up your order.My grandma asked for a ice cream cone but they gave her a cup instead.I recommend going to a different McDonald's for right now until they fix the problems.,1
This is the worst has McDonald's ever and I used to work there so I know,1
How do you go to a McDonalds that says 24 hours there,1
To hell with this McDonalds. They closed their lobby 10,1
"This location deserves a zero rating. Please don't go here. Even if you'reving to death. I wanted 1 hour and 20 mins for 2 combos and 2 extra Sandwiches. Ironically, as much as the wait was bad, it was the attitude of some of the team members that made this experience extremely terrible. McDonald's corporate really needs to come here and train thestaff for hospitality. This location is a disgrace to what Donald's has boult over the years",1
Horrible customer service I had to wait more than 40minutes to get my food because the manager is arguing with the customer in front of me and then he threw a couple water at her and she threw one back and this is not the only time I had to wait for my food the only reason why I come to this mc Donald's is because it's near my job and there's always too many homeless people ordering at the window  ,1
They suck,1
Wow!!  Today I went through the drive thru.  The cashier freaked out when I presented a discount coupon.   The cashier told me the receipt printer was out of paper.  When I pulled forward to the food pickup window.  I informed them and requested my receipt.  It turns out the cashier was lying just hiding the fact I was charge double on my credit card.  I waited 7 additional minutes for my tiny order to be prepared.  I brought to their attention about the overcharge.  They said to call and they will take care of it over the phone.  I have been calling the entire day.  No answer.,1
They close 1 hour earlier than scheduled,1
"Went to eat at 3:40 am.  And the guy tells me that there's only mc chicken sandwiches. And that's all.  And if I wanted breakfast, I'd have to wait till 4 am.  Ridiculous.",1
My fries where overcooked hard and greasy and the manager who brought our food to us spilled my drink on me never compensated I will not be returning. By far the worst McDonald's I ever been to ...your team is only as good as your team leader and this place has a very bad team leader,1
"Horrible service, the wait was excruciatingly long and the workers were very unprofessional.",1
Bad,1
The employees are very rude one of them snatched a bag out of my boyfriends hands because they messed up our order and when we complained to the manager she laughed and did nothing about it. I would expect better seeing is how it,1
Miyra is extremely rude and slow. Acts like she hates her job. Took 30 minutes to get an egg McMuffin and hash brown,1
Nothing personal I just don't like the quality of the food. This was the only place open on Christmas so.....,1
Literally the worst McDonalds ever . Food always cold.  Staff is all illegal and no help from them about asking about promotions always busy both inside and drive thru have plenty of workers but somehow always a long wait . Rude workers even if you call asking about promotions they always hang up . Even with all that said they still have the same stingy services with uber eats . Cold half cooked food go somewhere else save your money.,1
The worst McDonald,1
Horrible service.  No coffee. No milk. Horrible,1
Can't get the order right,1
They always Getting orders wrong more than 8 times.,1
"Hands down the worst McDonalds Ive ever experienced. Rudest employees. Lady in drive-thru looked like a manager and was infuriatingly rude and just a horrible person!! The young girl at the register refused to acknowledge me turned her head and walked right by as I tried to ask for help! Other people ordered, ate, and finished there food while I stood there unacknowledged for over 10 minutes waiting for 2 double cheeseburgers and a fry. A guy was just leaning on the counter doing nothing and walked away when I said I could not wait any longer. Never got my money back a",1
you do not get the whole change and its very dirty in there,1
"Very busy place, you wait for your food. The place is a mess and the staff is hardly personal.",1
"Waited ages for food, cold when arrived at table and items missing.  Stood in a queue full of people complaining to get food sorted by which time the rest of our order was stone cold. Staff not very pleasant and looked like they didnt care at all.  Not a good experience and wont be back!",1
Fresh food good staff,1
"If you like to have your order messed up, having people mumbling at you, and dont care about getting any sauce with your nuggets this place is for you. The crack heads hanging out in the drive through is also a nice touch, although based on my experience those might just be workers on their break. Oh and the fries ... so old and stale they would make a great ",1
Slowest McDonald's I've ever been to. 20 minutes trapped in the drive thru line.,1
Its n,1
"I bought some sundaes and I requested some napkins, but they refused to provide them to me. Too miserable for a multinational company. If they don't provide napkins, what can we expect for the food?",1
Ive been to McDonald,1
Bad service and received the wrong food.  Would never go to that McDonald,1
The staff is rude. My orders are seldom correct. Management is indignant when you call with an issue.,1
I work for Uber eats and having to wait more than 5 minutes at 3 am is very bad for business...,1
Went there tonight around 11:15 and the drive thru worker didnt have his headphone mic off and just kept cursing saying this is bull**** and kept on. I go to order my food and he tells me the milkshake machine is down. No problem but when I politely ask if theres a certain time it,1
Crew are so disrespectful!!!!,1
"I never leave reviews but I had to here.

Honestly, if you visited every single McDonalds in the country and ranked them I am convinced this one would be dead last.

I spent an hour in the drive-thru and when I got to the window it took 10 minutes before anyone even came to the window and when they did they had no idea what I had ordered.

I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest  in what they were doing. It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all. Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion, it was a sight to see.

Then when I finally did get my food the order it was, of course, not correct. But the weird thing is they didnt short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries.

I am just visiting and will never go there again anyways but ",1
Customer service was horrible,1
Charged me .80 for white cheddar and .80 for a tomato on my mchicken. Order 2 McDoubles and only received 1. And I didn,1
Saw a bunch of rats inside.,1
"Food was cold drinks missing
The manager is rude the advertising is false. She accused us of lieing when we said we weren't asked about the rewards to receive the free cookie.  Very hostile !",1
The security hear are a hassle.  You can't eat in peace.  I have a digestive problem and she is watching her clock. She's unprofessional and disrespectful to paying customers. She is pushing out.  You need to address her aproach.And how to handle the customers here.,1
"One of the worst McDonalds I've ever been to in the world! 1 person works here!! No cashier, no one in the kitchen, 1 person at drive through!! Totally unacceptable!",1
The worst McDonald's have ever been In My Life the stuff are rude,1
Chinese lady cashier refused to order. There is a app on the phone where it can have buy 1 get 1 free drinks.They force customer to buy the first drink if the second drink is free or not.,1
Garbage food..garbage prices..garbage employees,1
McDead,1
Terrible,1
"As an uber driver and delivery person today 29 10 2017 I received a delivery from that place for a client. I stay . At zero battery, but I take a current charger that I had in the car. I went to McDonald's I asked them to let me connect in the corridor to complete my order and they told me no. It couldn't end, I lost time and money, and I'm sorry for the customer and my uber company.",1
"No hand sanitizer. Biscuit was dry and hard. Staff wanted me to take a number to place on table, but I refused. No telling how many millions of ppl held that thing. The germs. Ugh!",1
"Unspeakable, to avoid as much as possible, better to eat pizza for a dollar.",1
"I do not like that MacDonald's, they have very bad service. Instead of 10, they gave me 8 chicken nuggets.",1
"Stay away! Beggars allowed to harass customers, area is filled with pickpockets, cashiers try to give less change and pocket the difference.",1
"The worst McDonalds I have ever been to. They serve very reluctantly, the order is always wrong. They give you one drink for another or forget to put the toy in the happy meal.",1
Night crew really sucks I had to go around twice to get my order correct and when confronted they want to get a attitude like it's my fault they work there smh,1
"Just avoid. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had with a McDonald's. I feel like you have to be trying to be terrible to be as bad as this location. There are other McDonald's close by, don't bother with this place.",1
"Attitude. Lack of knowledge of procedures. Terrible customer service. The place is filthy. Who runs this place? Definitely not a place I would recommend if you're having a good day. This place will ruin that, wholesale. Good riddance.",1
"Raw meat! Dont go here, second time happened to me",1
"I ordered a chicken buttermilk combo. Didnt get a drink. And when i tried to explain to the manager what happened, she wouldnt let me speak. Unsatisfactory",1
Employees were slovenly. One employee had her boyfriend behind the counter whispering in her ear instead of taking our order. Took 10 minutes to get a diet coke,1
Came with my friends they were all over the place we were mid order and they left us to go talk another worker had to help us and she was not very nice,1
The worst McDonalds ever! After standing in a backed up line with one guy running the register who had no clue! A manager finally steps up to help and still the line remainder ridiculous! Ited watching people just walkout because of the wait. This McDonalds is in a prime location and you would think they would be better prepared. Chick-fil-A is a block down the street and has a smaller parking lot and they never have the problem this McDonalds does.,1
Bad staff,1
Horrible place bad service. I ordered at 3:40am didn't get my order until 4:13 I was missing half my order and when I told them they had the nerve to say they will replace it for breakfast items because they no longer serve lunch. It's not my fault they can't do their job correct and get orders right!,1
"Rude cashiers, waited for lmost 40mns in drive thru why do they make 2 lanes waste of time",1
Bad attention,1
"Dirty, crowded and loud.",1
We spent more than half an hour in the drive through. One person is doing all the work. The ice cream machine is not working as well as the milk shake :(,1
If you want to watch employee's fight and spend a half a hour waiting on fries and a Frappe this is the McDonalds for you. Service between 5 - 6 am horrible and the 10pm line is backed up onto Ewing Ave. Very Childish and unpleasant employee's.,1
I wanted to order but they didn't have a curbside option and they weren't open for dining in. A bunch of people tries going through the drive thru but because we didn't have cars they wouldn't even talk to us. There were a lot of other customers too.,1
"Employees in the drive thru were rude, they forgot to put napkins and straws in the bag, and when they brought the order to us in the parking spot they thrust it at my husband with a ""here"" and walked off. Very rude.",1
Horrible and very rude guard,1
"If I could give this place zero I would after my experience here tonight. The employee (manager) handling the front end was the rudest individual I've ever met of all my visits to McDonald's in my 30 years. Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food. One lady said she'd been waiting on her food for over an hour. They wouldn't even accommodate her with a refund. Infact my order $25 took 40 min to fill. The store shut down the kiosks, as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby. I understand it's easy to get overwhelmed but when you're filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour, your prioritizing methods are failing. And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers. I'm on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again. But if I were a local, they would have just received their last $25 from my pocket. My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald's in down town orlando, the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly. The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty. McDonald's, I'd fix this ladies attitude or I'd find her replacement.",1
"We went here late night after EDC. Around 2am, we waited about an hour to get our food. Whatever its the night of EDC so it was crowded ok. In a 22$ order, we were missing 2 items equaling 8$ and a sweet and sour sauce that they charged me 2$ for. After going back and telling them what happened, they argued. I eventually got the egg sandwich and double bacon cheeseburger, which ended up having no bacon. Still never got that 2$ sweet and sour.",1
"Lol. It's McDonald's what do you expect. But man, this is bottom of the barrel. Even for McDonald's it's terrible. Drive the extra 5 minutes to the other one.

3/5 for food.
-5/5 for service.",1
DO NOT DO MOBILE ORDER HERE! They will take your money and dont receive any order from the mobile app.,1
"It was a crappy McDonald's. They lie about their hours I went around 9:30 for food and they were ""closed""! When they clearly say that they are 24hours. Don't waste your time with this place! Worst McDonald's ever",1
This place customer service is TRASSSSSH throw the whole McDonald's away NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By the way I HAD TO ADD A ,1
They had someone who dont know how to take order and and everything was dry nasty and the coffee plus the manager was there smh,1
"Never eating here, I like my food with out fly's..",1
"Well, Ive been here a lot of times but this is the last time. The service is bad, the wait time is not even close to be fast food standards (",1
The worst McDonald's which I ever met... After 20 minutes in the front line I could order any meal.,1
"Lobby closed early and would not take our order in the drive through even though we were paying customers, clearly displaying their classism as we did not have a car. Encouraged two inebriated individuals in front of us to come back with in car (recommended getting a DUI).",1
Bad service. 30 minutes waiting for a coffee.,1
"Employees are so slow, waited 25 min for a big mac.",1
Its mcdonalds....,1
"This was the worst McDonald's I've been in. We ordered using the kiosk and  they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food. We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy. The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husband's drink. He went to the counter to get it and they didn't believe him at first. My coffee had the label on it for what I'd ordered but it didn't have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it, took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds. The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid. I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered. Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot. The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonald's for a while. The staff didn't seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonald's website and we left.",1
Maybe the dirtiest Mc Donalds I have ever seen,1
"I'm sorry. But half the people working here dont have a clue whats going on. 98% of the time I come here, they forget something. Its unbelievable. No other fast food chain has as many issues as any McDonald's does. Blows my mind. And these people want raises? Learn how to do your job if you want a raise.",1
"Absolutely the slowest service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  Me and my 3 friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals.  After 45 minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food.  There was one person working fries, one cook, on manager assisting the cook, and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers.  The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on.  He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers. Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the. After seeing that 3 customers who ordered 20+ minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager. He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que.  So he had no idea what any of us ordered. We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us 10 minutes later. All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty.   All the employees including the manager didn't even look 18 years old. They were definitely under trained, mis managed, and probably under staffed.",1
"Came here at 4 in the morning and they told me they are closed, but right before I drove up to the window there was another guy Infront of me that they served. Something else funny has happened at this McDonald's before! I went there in person to get a milkshake but they told me they don't have it, when I got home I went on Uber eats and ordered a milkshake from that same McDonald's XD. LOL",1
Soggy fries... old bun.. cold burger.... ,1
"They got my order wrong... This happens often.

To make things worse they are very inefficient. Ordered a small fries, they served 10 other people before I got mine. Seriously, fill up a small bag with fries while you await other order burgers. I used to worl at McDonalds 10 years ago and know how it should be run. Horrible!

Ironically two other individuals complained about their order while I waited and one got into an argument with the manager over cold cheese.",1
Worst McDonalds I have ever been too. The water they provided was pink and when I asked if we could get new waters the lady told me all of the water comes out that way and there is nothing she could do about it. In other words she was too lazy to get me new waters. Cant figure out why McDon,1
Shouldn't be impossible to serve lunch 5 min early,1
Terrible,1
Bad,1
Ridiculously slow service,1
"This has been one of the worst McDonald's I have been too. Not only where the to drive through lines extremely long, but then when we get to the window the person was confused with our order. We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough. The food now left a lot to be desired. French fries were not fresh. They had zero salt. We ordered a 10 piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces. Then on top of that they're old and stale and cold. Needless to say we will never be going there again.",1
"The staff barely speaks English, they never get your order right. Most of the time they're just downright rude. I wouldn't recommend this Macdonalds to anybody.",1
Never get what you order...,1
The service was alful everyone working the front was either on there phone or joking around. They got my order wrong twice. New management is needed and a whole new crew to go with it.,1
Restroom out of service. No reason. They don't want us to use it.,1
"Huffy/puffy employees with an attitude that will NOT listen. I specifically asked for seasoned fries three times while ordering, and then asked if she would give me the packets now (as they usually do) and she said I'd get them with my order. I did not. Had to wait for the woman to come over again (with the next order) to ask for seasoning and she walked away before I could specify the flavor (ranch). Handed me a random flavor (cheesy) and walked away again. Had to wait for her to serve the next order to ask for ketchup.

Overall very unorganized and chaotic service. A very loud, crowded, and dirty location with no bathrooms.

I understand the employees are busy and under a lot of stress but the management needs better crowd control and to hire more employees to handle the work load and provide better customer service.",1
"When I'm up early in the morning,I can't stop there for early meals,so I'm lead to go to 711 store.",1
Worst hang out for homeless and problematic people,1
Gross.,1
"Worst experience ever!! First the cashier gave me attitude about using the app for the $1 large fries, he sighed when I showed it to him. Then said in a rude tone that I need to show him the bar code (in the past I just show them the number and they type it in) Then literally rolled his eyes when I told him it was Apple Pay and said whatever Thened at me after taking the Apple Pay, so I figured I would get the receipt at the next window. I pulled up to the next window and they told me the other guy has thrown the receipt away. Got home, looked to see how much I was charged and he did not apply the app discount to the fries.  My fries that I had ordered well done,  both large and medium were cold and soft (I live a block away) the nuggets were old and the cheeseburger bun was not soft. I was there today, a Sunday at 6 pm ( dinner time, things shor charged for cold, not fresh food",1

"Still bad, so sad. Frappe no good. Go somewhere else.",1
My order was handed to someone else who IMMEDIATELY ATE MY FRIES! MGMT OFFERED TO REMAKE MY ORDER FRESH WHICH I AGREED. THE ORDER CAME OUT LESS THAN 30SECS LATER. I USED TO WORK FOR MC.Ds AND OTHER FF RESTAURANTS AND I KNEW THAT WASN'T RIGHT!! TRASHED THE FOOD.SMDH!!!0,1

If the app says you can dine in there than you should be able to dine inside,1

They didnt get my order right and my food was cold,1

Terrible processed unhealthy food that squarely contributes to the diabetic and obesity epidemic especially with the underprivileged.  Went only as an emergency.,1
They say its open 24 hours but I get here and they say they are closed I have been seating here waiting for over an ha our and nothing. A la,1
This location should have stayed closed. Why do they have a re-opening sign when they're only operating for drive thru. What about the pedestrians? The ones who can't drive? At least I was able to walk in and  order food before they remodeled. I live less than a mile from here and I can't walk over and physically order food? And why is there a parking lot if we can't walk in. And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru? You're better off going to the one on burbank Blvd. Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesn't expect problems? This isn't it McDonald's... 20 minutes sitting in a drive thru...,1
"I have been staying at the Holiday Inn next door to the McDonald's for four days now. Every morning we walk over to McDonald's to get bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits and hash browns. EVERY SINGLE MORNING that we've went over there, we have gotten hard, rubbery, cold, biscuits. Their hash browns are hard as well, and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up.

I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with ""better biscuits"". However, the replacement biscuits were undercooked. They were very doughy. I do not recommend this place to anyone. The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food.",1
The Hispanic females there were putting hair in people's food,1
The cashier was confused. I was so upset that I left without eating.,1
"Companies need to understand it's not 2020 anymore. The public is tired of your excuses. Be aware this locationts breakfast at 4am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash, and mobile orders are not accepted, and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this. Maybe it's legit, seems shady though. If anything it is poor management. It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be. But you should have it ready to go by time your breakfast hourst, and the mobile app should not be accepting orders.",1
"Always out of items,never have the special promoted items. Food is cold not a good location",1
"Usually I don't have time to eat at McDonalds. So I take food to-go. This is not the first time that I order something and I get something. These people always miss something from the order and since its to-go, I can't even go back and tell them. It happened like 5-6th so far. Very poor service from this McD.

Hopefully they read this and do something about it.",1
"Even with the shockingly low bar McDonald's has set, this particular location fails to meet even that expectation. It feels post apocalyptic in here. All doors except one are locked but not marked. The floor doesn't look like it's been cleaned in weeks. My shoes stuck to the floor so strongly that one pulled off. To top it all off, the staff were rude to several customers who were confused by the disabled ordering systems.",1

I ORDERED THE WHOLE MENU THEN I GOT FAT AFTER DONT RECOMMEND GOING HERE,1
"This is what I encountered when I came to this location today.  A trash bag wrapped around the door by the security guard to stop ppl from coming in.   So instead of a safe, warm location to order and pickup from, I had to wait on a very dangerous Avenue in NYC while they took their sweet time in making my order.  20 minutes to make breakfast and having to wait on a dangerous street is ABSOLUTELY APPALING",1

Awful. 2AM visit. Only two workers. Took 30 minutes with nobody in line as the cashier had to run food out to cars waiting too long in drive through. Fries were undercooked.,1
"Too crowded, tables were a mess and they took almost 40mins to have our food ready, when we ask for it they weren't too helpful/friendly. The upstairs AC wasnt running or something was wrong it was too hot, overall it just seems like they were understaffed for the amount of people there.",1
Someone is going to get hurt or killed coming here or passing by! Right across the street from the Oak Park PD yet lines are out in the street in Madison and people do not watch when pulling in or out! FIX IT!!!,1
"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to how there still open I don't know the employee at the drive thru was rude, buns were hard, I was missing two burgers out of the order, the nuggets were cold they tasted like they were old if I could give them a big fat 0 I would very disappointed with this restaurant...",1
"Came on 06/03/2023 at 10pm. So many things were out of stock, including Happy Meals, McChicken and Hot&Spicy McChicken, smaller portion of nuggets (only from 10pieces), large fries but no medium, etc Why ? Lack of packaging ?

Came there with a toddler. Pretty sad.

But the worse to come Never ever be disappointed with the taste of the fries. Ok. Those can be sometimes old, McDonalds products are fresh for 10 minutes only. Fries were mushy, and the taste was nasty. Same nasty taste on the nuggets",1
Bad attitude from the people over there,1

Terrible,1
"Worst McDonalds you can possibly find in Florida. If I could give 0 that would be more suitable.  They mess up orders they're the only McDonalds in 10 miles that charges extra after 2 pumps of sugar. They dont understand what ""light ice"" means and you're going to have problems if you are trying to use their app for coupons. Please do not allow this McDonalds to ruin your experience and take your money, any McDonalds within 5 miles of this location will provide you the proper service McDonalds is iconic for. Take it from a local, stay far away from this location unless you like waiting ridiculous wait times and feeling cheated out of your money. I have visited this location enough times to understand they are literally the worst location I have been to. This is coming from someone who has been all around central Florida.

This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment, fast food or not.

"Visited today. Play place was out of service. Dine in service was not available. Some of the menu items we wanted were not available Ordered food from the machine, but a staff member said he couldn't find it in the system,ted to retype it in the cashier. Our order was customized and the worker made a few mistakes. When I asked what was going on, heted making rude comments and asked if I spoke English.
I asked for the refund, and the worker refunded me $3 less. Then the manager came, and fixed the refund error. The manager was calm, but didn't offer any apology.

The saddest part is - this is a flagship McDonalds location, advertised as the biggest McDonalds in the world with Play Place and Entertainment. I hoped to see exemplary service and atmosphere, but it was a huge disappointment.

I wish next time I visit (if ever) to see working services, friendly and competent staff, and adequate food selection. Peace!",1
Waited in line 20+ minutes only to get someone else's order and no way to get our correct order because they don't answer the phone and they're too busy. Super irritating.,1
I feel bad writing this review..  The workers seemed very confused one lady in the 15 minutes I spent in the location stood by the soda machine in a daze. She wasn't even the one who gave us our drinks. I would really like to find out what her purpose was. The food came out cold with exception of fries. The manager looked so frustrated I hesitated to return the order. Terrible,1
Fries were cold and I ordered a Large size ($2.80+tax) that was only filled half way. I asked them if they could please fill them up and she literally put just a few more on top and when I stood it up it was just a little over half way now. They wouldn't even pass the edge of the front part. When I showed it to her she got annoyed and closed the window. Very rude employees,1
I think the management is so bad,1
"Kid wouldn't take our order with cash but took a single girls order with cash.

Walked us to a kiosk. This world's so screwed. And this McDonald's is racist. Would get negative if possible.",1
The old lady on the cashier is so RUDE. She speaks poorly english and is rude.,1
Went to eat there tonight and no one was there. It says that you guys are open 24 hours drive thru only but no one was there at the kiosk or at the windows. So please update your business hours.,1

"I would like to preface with the statement that I am a fairly hardcore proponent of the proletariat. With that said, the fact that they force you to utilize the kiosk must me some kind of self sabotage. If people are willing to pay at the counter then it could drive down demand for the kiosk.

Secondly; there is a heavyset woman with glasses that gets mad and angry when customers ask for stuff and has to forward it to the manager every time yelling loud enough for rhe lobby; not to mention she hovers over the lobby while people are eating (i get that you want to catch mess early or clean the tables quick I have worked food service before) but do not hover around people trying to eat like some kind of table patrol.

Fortunately the security guard is calm and collected. I mean generally if youre on the clock where else do you have to be?

Service is inconsistent, per the usual, horrible with Uber eats drivers and seem intent on the self destructive goal of ""sabotage my job"".",1

Service is slow.  The neighborhood is so bad they have security in the lobby.  A person has to wonder just how safe is it to stop and dine here.  Lock your car.  Leave nothing if value in view.  Broken window glass in the parking lot,1

This is 3rd time I got this ,1
The staff charged for the wrong meal and never offered to reimburse the difference.  One of my kids asked for yogurt she gave apple.  One of the drinks was supposed to be lemonade she gave sprite.  The bun was hard and stale tasting on my sandwich.  My entire food was cold.,1

There were no signs or anything stating such, and I've never seen another McDonald's telling people this, so I'm pretty sure the worker just lied to us.",1
Really slow service inside,1
Worst Mcdonalds I have ever been to. Really rude employees and they take FOREVER for the simplest happymeal order.,1
I asked the one of the employees a question and he lied right to my face,1
Very rude at drive thru. Management needs to work on who they have at the speaker and window.,1
Horrible customer service. They treat Uber/Doordash like they are less than. Really bad. If McDs gonna take these delivery orders they should hire enough people to have them ready not leave a crowd of guys waiting for their deliveries. Unacceptable!,1
Long wait. My order was ready and they gave me the order when they felt like it. Never going to any mcds ever again.,1
GOT MY ORDER WRONG!!!,1
Took forever and drive through was down. Took over 30 mins to get food after they said the drive through was down and we went inside. Terrible service.,1
Been here 4 separate times at night and no one takes orders or even acts like they are open. It says 24 hours but after 1am they stop serving customers. This place sucks,1
"The manager and or the Owner does not have business sense. Poor staffing for the late shift. I pulled up to order some french fries at 10:30 and was told it will be a 20 minute wait and to pull to the parking lot. I asked why and the person said ""I have to go to school in the morning"". He said the owner do the hiring and it is not his fault. 1. Bad choice of words. 2. They may need to not be a 24 hour McDonald's 3. Hire appropriate staff.
I was taken back be the unprofessionalism I was handed. And charged $2 for a small order of fries.  SMH. I am glad that my mood was good. However I do not feel sorry for reporting them to the BBB and giving a BAD rating. They need to do better or get better ownership because they McDonald's look bad.",1
Not one person working spoke hardly any English inquired about Santa's Enchanted Forest coupons which was posted on the door no one could even answer me and said the didn't speak English. I said how you have a job in the United States and not even be able to speak English and they just laugh at me. It took at least 30 min to get a sweet tea this place is Seriously Screwed Up! I will Definitely be calling customer service about my issues at this McDonald's.,1
Service at this McDonalds is horrible...Dont know how to greet customers nor answer with proper tones. I come here because close to home and no matter if i go inside or drive thru takes long to take order as well as prepare them. I asked are they not required to wear hairnets and was told NO. Being that I work in the food service industry I know its required by state law...However ,1
I don't like,1
Avoid it if you can. The service is terrible; some employees need to go back to training to enhance their costumer service skills.,1
Staff is untrained and manager does not get involved. Cashier messed up order confront of me and behind me as well. Employees seemed to not be shocked by all the mistakes.,1

Third time in a row to get the hamburger happy meal with just ketchup only to have cheese added each time.  My child will not eat it if cheese has touched it. They have new toys for the kids however we keep getting toys that are 6 months old. Not a good location for the lack of service and food.,1

"The 1st issue with this McDonald's location was at 7pm they don't have sweet tea.  Secondly, the water for a hot tea was luke warm, at best, then when asked, ""Is this the hottest this water can get?""  With a response of yes.  This is at 7pm.  McDonald's food quality has dipped since this pandemic and I suppose it's because if it.  Boooo.",1
They suck,1
"Expect to wait 15-20 min for drive thru. Recieved our sweet teas at the window, and it had a bit of coffee taste. The person at the window sampled the tea and said it tastes like tea. NOT to us. Seemed very frustrated. She asked us what we would like. I told her Dr pepper, and before I could tell her the rest of the drink order, she rushes off and gets us 3 dr peppers. Then when we corrected her, she said we asjed for 3 dr peppers. This is my burger without onions and pickles. What you see on my fingers is grease from the burger. Good luck getting your food here.",1
HORRIBLE! It took 54 mins to get our food and then it was nasty. We watched the manager mix sweet and unsweet to fill a mans tea. Noone ever asked for our order so we pulled forward at the window. Will NEVER stop at this location on our way home from Seaworld. EVER!,1
I guess they got to rip off their guests to afford the building the management staff are rude when you order a shake medium it comes in a little small kids cup I order two Filet-O-Fish fish or they're not offering the 2 for 5  but that's okay they're not even putting tartar sauce on the sandwich I was just bread  the Fish so I guess they had to cut  cost somewhere when they charge you $15 for fish and don't put anything  on it. I won't go back. Here is how to save some money fire some of those managers that are rude for your guests and that'll save you some money andt building the sandwich correctly,1

This morning around 12:28 am 11/24/18 when asked the very standard "" may I see the food allergy menu"" or since that wasn't available, ""would you mind checking the ingredients on the package while I wait to place my order while others go ahead"" the cashier was told by the manager right in front of me that she would not get the menu nor would she check the ingredients and went right back to laughing and carrying on with another employee.  The same manager stood around looking at others needing help during the rush without any movement or intention to step in for her team or their long waiting customers.  The entire place was in disarray from the back to the front with filthy tables, floors, and bathrooms.  Every trash can in the place was overflowing and the pungent smells both in the lobby and the restrooms were enough to make anyone lose their appetite.  Black Friday or not... absolutely unacceptable brazen behavior from management that I would never tolerate under any circumstance from my own team at any level of the company.  Zero...would not recommend.",1
The worst McDonald's experience of my life they seemed confused and unprofessional they didn't know how long my order would take yet they where serving people after me they ordered and got their food then left meanwhile I waited 20minuits and had to leave without the food because every time I asked how long they ignored me and walked away without any answers would not recommend to anyone.,1
Unbelievable...9 minutes for a tiny cheeseburger,1
"Always seems to be a problem when we go at night after hours like between 12a -4a. Be it a system failure,  stock depletion,  etc.  Also the employees are hardly ever happy or cordial in doing their job",1
"Waited TWENTY MINUTES in a drive thru with only 2 cars in front of me, only to be asked to park because the 6 pieces of nuggets (that was my whole order) were not ready. I asked for a refund. I also peeked in and there were a lot of employees and orders behind mine were ready. Never again.",1
Bad,1
"Very upset about my ice caramel macchiato.  Why so much caramel syrup??   Enough to make another two drinks, ruin it.  Threw it out smh",1
"worse service ever! They always get my order wrong or give you the incorrect item. One time I was at the 1st order Station for 15 minutes! The cars at the second order station was getting taken care of when I pulled up and asked for the manager she was very rude and said she wouldn't take my order because I wanted to know why cars that came after me was served first! That was not the first time... Please avoid this place and go to the one on heller parkway or Belleville , better service food is on time and correct and warm. Unlike this location that needs to hire more mature people and not you'd kids that are rude and always arguing .....",1
"I go very often but today is the last time...You guys never pay attention . i think a good 65% of the time i go,  ive gotten the wrong order in the morning.  Take a little bit more pride in your work, pay attention to detail and care a bit...",1
No breakfast at night and cash only and they act like we're supposed to know this in advance.,1
"Terrible service. Cashier had a bad attitude and was very disrespectful. Refused to give her name. Found out it is Brittany. Female manager seemed clueless amd not helpful whatsoever. After over an hour from the time we entered the drive thru til we got our food, it was still made wrong. We've submitted the issue to corporate requesting contact. No response. Obviously they do not care about their customers.",1
"They won't let me put zero, that's why I chose one and they don't deserve it. The worst MacDonald in the United States, they are a shame, the bad treatment they give to customers, I was in the second line, 3 cars passed by from the first and they didn't serve me When my turn came, they yelled at me because I ordered in Spanish. I asked to speak to the manager, he told me NO, then my 9-year-old daughter asked for her order in English and told her that she was not going to sell and said a bad word to her...I had I explained to the manager that they called him and in front of her he treated me badly for not speaking English, a very bad attitude from that person... how sad with so many people who need to work, they give work to people without education or respect...",1

Never eating here again was on my lunch break staff ignored me after I ordered and I waited 30 minutes for my food I ended up having to leave without eating just to get back to work I only ordered 2 large fries and a smoothie how hard is that?!,1
Requested freshly brewed coffee. Was told there'd be a small wait & I gladly waited! Only to be served a HOT CUP OF SLUDGE,1
"0. It was 11 pm and I was trying to grab a quick snack after work. The cashier told me i couldn't order anything from the dollar menu. They were only serving large combo meals after 9 pm. They had medium cups but wouldnt allow customers to buy medium drinks. I didnt want to spend $9 on food that i didnt want.
I went to the 7-eleven down the street and bought pizza and a drink instead.",1
My order is always wrong. I was making my order in the drive through she ask me what I wanted to drink when I answer she we have no soda.smh,1
rolled up to the window and someone told me the power was out. 10 minutes of my life i'll never get back.,1
"The Service is bad in special the drivetrue they never give the food correct and management are worse that the bad service that people receive they do not know the meaning of customer service.

The service isn't polite and every single person stands around and is doing nothing",1
"Today date is 8/4/2019 , time 6:59 pm, just walked in to use the bathroom and was told by a security guy that I couldnt use the bathroom unless I buy something. He had a key from the bathroom and was sitting right next to the bathroom. I said ok, and then looked for a manager. The manager had confirmed that you had to buy something to use a bathroom. But for me, she would do a favor by letting me t",1
Worst McDonalds I've ever been to. Just awful customer service. We did go in after 10pm but it took 20 minutes to get the meal. Staff were busy joking around and messed up so many peoples orders.,1

"Their iced tea tasted like water with a splash of tea so it tasted disgusting. I ordered a meal and they forgot the fries. And lastly, the girl at the counter had the worst attitude problem like it was killing her to God forbid do her job. If you come here, make sure all of your stuff is in the bag because they just hate their jobs there obviously.",1
The hours say they are open at 5:00am but it's 5:30 and the doors are  locked. I have been waiting for half an hour and still not open only drive thru I don't have a car so thats not helpful.,1

12.17 Late Saturday and No one is working at this McDonald's.  It's supposed to be 24 hours.  Poorly managed like most McDonald's.  GM should be canned.,1
"Terrible  customer service. Besides having to wait in line at the drive -thru for over 10 mins to get 1 coffee, was pathetic. Then it never fails the employee at the window that hands your food thru drive thru, never is even courteous or says a simple HELLO or Here', your food! I hate service like that. And it hasn't just been this one time, it's always that way.",1

I had to wait for a coffee 30 minutes    not a good experience I,1
"Two employees preparing the food simply didn't wear a mask. I am highly dissatisfied with the effort put into enforcing the wearing of a mask. Why during this pandemic, which has not settled in the least, have you not have had a keen eye on employees in order to safeguard the wellbeing of your customers. It's unacceptable to have this lack of care while thousands of healthcare workers are having to work day in and out (With a mask on!) To save lives. Consider this message before you enter this McDonald's (Or any restaurant really) because the meal you get can very well be the deciding factor on whether or not you live in weeks time.
And the fries were luke warm..",1
Dine in closed and no access to public restrooms smh all bad,1
The McDonald's employee straight up lied toy face when I ordered something and asked them to make an order special to accommodate my needs.  McDonald's needs to reevaluate customer service.,1
With the size of the big breakfast that wouldve a child. Maybe you shouldt calling it baby breakfast. If you don't get cakes with it then you have over half a tray of just a bite of eggs two small strips of bacon and a dry/hard biscuit. I think a total of six bites and two minutes with phone in hand while eating and it was gone. There goes almost ten bucks.,1
Store is unprofessional not open during business hours. When does that happen at mcdonalds. Not a good look.,1
It took 50 minutes to receive my order dining in. There was no organization and to top it all off the food with cold what a waste of $27 sorry Ronald maybe next time,1
Rude staff! An employee is going from table to table asking to do a review on your cell phone! She has a handful of duplicate receipts and is giving the store good reviews... Please tear this location down and build a new one! The blonde in the white shirt is a smiling crook! She is supposed to be a manager. UPDATE: Their is none,1

I used to love McDonald's fries but not no more. You can't never really get anything fresh from McDonald's. I used to tell them could they make my McChicken now when they did it taste so much better. But everything is preheated or been waiting for you LOL,1
Junk food,1
"Do NOT go to this McDonald's if you're in a hurry. We were just picking up a drink so it wasn't a problem but ordering was chaos and there was a guy beside us who had seriously been waiting 35 min for his chicken sandwich. He showed us the receipt showing when he ordered and was trying to ask the staff what was happening and they were quite rude and just said ""man you can see we busy"". Also note that this was the only McDonald's we encountered in Florida that doesn't offer $1 any size soft drinks.",1
No electric outlets to charge phones!!!!  This McDonald location is falling back hard. The staff have very poor work ethics. Tattoos and lack of respect are prominent here.,1
Disgusting McDonald's. There managers are dating employee's and there's an employee who was fired for walking up to a customer and almost hitting him and got rehired. Terrible customer service,1
Bad bad bad.,1
This McDonalds is a hot mess.   I live near it and regret coming here every time I do.    Always out of something or a machine is down.     Tonight I sat in the drive through for 15+ min just sitting here watch the drive thru guy freak out over his computer not working...only to be told a machine is out.   Get it together!,1
"This place deserves no. My order, which was just a sandwich, was messed up three times and it still wasn't right. The staff was lazy and unhelpful. There was trash on the tables and filthy floors. Definitely no smiles served at this establishment!",1
Nasty,1
"Cold food, not prepared as ordered. Complained and they didn't seem to care. Would not recommend at all .",1
Trash. Customer service is trash.   I'll never want mcdonalds for real.  Been 3 weeks since tomorrow.,1
Waaaaay understaffed. I don't know what's going on here but they are always slow and food is cold or burned,1
"Absolutely, without pause, the WORST excuse for a McDonalds I've seen. No coffee. No chicken sandwiches. No restroom. No seating. Dirty. Rude people wearing McDonald's uniform.(normally their titles would be employee/workers. That may suggest they earned their wage!)",1
Very unprofessional rude manager,1
Their bathroom facilities were horrible... No food place should have that much disgust; makes you think about not eating there!!,1
"I stopped by for a number 1 at McDonald's and got a cold big Mac and a hard bun, In n Out has never given me a cold burger, I should know better.",1
Nasty foul odor of chinese food overtook the place upon entering and in entire lobby. Employees must've had massive chinese take out order leading to the offensive odor. I lost my appetite and will avoid this location like corona virus.,1
Very dirty dicusting.. food was sloppy and taste awful... wired and very unpleasant view of costumers in there...the most ugliest McDonald's I've ever been to,1
Terrible,1
Just order from here with uber eats for the first time and i received my food in a timely fashion but while i was eating my big mac i found a hair in it i made a complain to uber and i have called McDonald's 4 times and no one picks up the only reason i dont go to the store and complain is because im at work and cant leave my job active security guard,1
"Both online and the sign here says they are 24hr. Tried coming in to get some food for my kids last night after a 7 hrs road trip. They had shut down the drive through and doors. When I CALLED THE STORE AND ASKED THE MANAGER HUNG UP IN MY FACE 2 TIMES. WHEN ALL I WAS ASKING WAS WHAT TIME DO THEY CLOSE AND WHY DOES IT SAY 24 HOURS IF YOUR SHUT DOWN?!?!?

THEN I PROCEEDED TO CALL THE NEXT MORNING AND ASKED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER, EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED TOLD HER ID LIKE THE MANAGER NAME FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE TO REPORT IT TO COORPRATE, SHE THEN TOO HUNG UP IN MY FACE TOO!!!

THESE ARE THR MANAGERS ACTING LIKE THAT ? IM FAR BEYOND DISSAPOINTED AND I WILL BE STILL REACHING OUT TO COORPRATE.  THEY DONT DESERVE THEIR JOBS AT ALL, SOMONE ELSE WOULD REALLY NEED THAT JOB AND TREAT THE CUSTOMERS PROPER .",1

Please stop frying your fries in beef and do it in vegetable oil like the rest of the world's McDonald's do! The food choice is literally nothing for people who don't eat meat.,1
Go ahead and get poisoned. I deffinently wont be.,1
Horrible customer service. Messed up my order. Waited 10 minutes for order and then another 10 minutes for them to correct it.,1
I sat in drive through Tuesday night around 11:30 PM for 20 minutes and pull up to order and associate says sorry we are closed I explained to him that I had been waiting already for over 20 minutes and he mumbled something and said sorry the website says open 24hrs,1
"Must invest in security staff, hassled multiple times by persons not patrons of the restaurant to buy things. Staff don't care and turn a blind eye to it.",1
"Horrible service, staff was very rude and we waited over 20 minutes for our order. When we asked why it was taking so long the lady said ""well you can wait for the food or you can just leave now""",1
During a severe thunderstorm I told my son to pull over and get indoors. He was right near Mcdonalds in Champlain and he went in and ordered some food. After he got his food they kicked my son out and said he couldn't hang around due to covid right in the middle of the worst part of the storm. Use some common sense Mcdonalds and have a heart.,1
I went through the drive-through and ordered a double Mac meal. I received a single Mac meal And the food was cold. I drove away and call back and told  Them  my meal was wrong. The manager tells me on my next visit I will receive a complimentary order. NO how about giving me the right order or given me my money back. I gave this McDonald's the benefit of Benefit of the doubt is not my 1st Bad Experience in this McDonald's. But it will be my last as I will never visit this McDonald's again.,1
This is the worst McDonalds I hav,1

If only I could give less than 1!!! I swore off McDonalds long ago however I happened to be with someone who stopped in so I decided to get a breakfast sandwich thinking it would be hard to go wrong with breakfast... I got food poisoning for the first time in my 29 years of LIFE. A quite unwelcome reminder to stay far away..,1
Late night crew horrible there is no one at the register everyone is hiding in the back and the short asian manager has a disgusting attitude and barely speaks english food was cold and my hamburger bun was stiff meat was horrible,1

"The place is not clean, the service is slow",1
Slow service and bad food.,1
"The most incompetent staff and management I've ever experienced in a fast food restaurant. Items missing in my order even after I asked if it was placed in the bag, Rude staff, very unprofessional, laughing/ joking with other employees while on the headset taking my order. Business number that appears online is disconnected, so you can't reach any management. Not even thru the survey online you can get anyone from corporate. Definitely I rather microwave a dollar burrito than come back here.",1
They always mess up my order!,1
"Lobby Hours 8 am- whenever they feel like locking the doors. I showed up at 7:10 pm FIFTY MINUTES BEFORE SCHEDULED CLOSING, TO ALL THE DOORS LOCKED.

Today was the worse ever service,1

Worst McDonald's experience ive ever had worst staff unprofessional and nasty the place was a pig stuy and everyone was lost and i got told off by one of the young ladies.

Something needs to be done ill be looking forward to a response from upper management.,1
"So my boyfriend and I ordered a large fries and 2 large drinks. We get to the window to pay l Had a coupon on the app for the large fries. Then I was paying for the rest on venmo. The girl at the register had no idea what she was doing. She had the assistant manager come help her she had no idea what she was doing... Then the manager came and we had now told them over 7 times to just take off the drinks... The manager still had a hard time....
How hard is it to take 2 drinks off an order.
He then was trying to say we had to pay for the fries. He eventually just let us have the fries for free. We also had a second order with another large fries. (we had 2 phone's with Free fries)
They were all rude and didn't care about us at all.

Not open on the inside and it's 518am second McDonald's this morning still not open,1
Never come here after 10pm you will be waiting forever for your order literally 45 minutes.,1
"This location consistently neglects basics like including sauce, utensils and will substitute your desert side for whatever else they feel like.  If you order a coffee with extras, 4/5 times they wont put them in. I, like any normal person, loathe paying for things I dont get! This happens often but today something egregious happened: I ordered a 3 pack of cookies. Checked the bag, there were only 2 inside. So I asked for the 3rd, a woman working there snatched the cookies from me and darted back (i assumed to grab the missing item) she returned empty handed and said more cookies are coming. I wasnt willing to wait and asked for my 2 cookies back but She wouldn",1
"This particular location is by farting to be the worst in alliance! Their fries are always cold they sweet tea is nasty and the burgers are ""warm"" last week was our last time going to this location. We've found a better one",1
"Meh.. just meh. When I finally get the correct order, it is generally tasty. I'm a picky eater, and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items I like. Worked in the service industry for years as a server, bartender, and trainer. Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard, tedious at times though. I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly. I have submitted several complaints and NEVER received a call or email back. I just don't go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong.",1
Waited 30 min in the drive through and did not even move. Rude cashier and no salt even on fries. Lol and they want to make $15 an hour! Comical,1
No dollar menu anything but drinks here! Even coffee is 2 bucks! The service is spotty and confusing at best! The place is small and serves the end of the busiest street that leads to the pier....ultra poor planning on space for quality of service/business. There are a lot kf vagrants at this location but they are for the most part harmless.,1

"There was an excruciating 15 minute wait time for two simple breakfast sandwiches, and the place was empty. When checked, the sandwiches were actually missing the cheese.
While waiting, some filthy guy was exchanging $80 in singles for twenties. After he got done with his banking transaction, he actually spun around and walked right into me- talk about the bum rush!!
The true danger here, though, is when you try to enter. There is a welcome sign at the curb directing cars to enter into a single lane driveway where the drive-thru actually exits. A head-on collision waiting to happen.
Stay far away from this place.",1
Fries were hard and cold tasted like they were from the bottom of the pan and nuggets were old and nasty. Never will go here again!,1

Oh I forgot America is already obese.",1
The fat black cashier can't get my order right. The 10pcs Chicken Niggets will cost you 6 bucks That too much.,1
Worst McDonalds  I've ever been to. Waited over twenty minutes.  Burgers were almost  raw. Plus no toys in happy meals.,1
DO NOT EAT HERE. Me and 2 friends work right near this McDonald's. We all have each gotten sick twice on completely different occasions each time we eat here. I'm pretty sure they cook these burgers on the floor.. Don't go here unless you like upset stomachs or puking.,1
"Never good! Food was cold, fries were soggy! If I want with someone I wouldn't have even gone. I would give zero if I could",1
The worst McDonald's in Am,1

"Requested for caramel fappe, I waited for more than 20 mins still they couldn't make it. They are saying they dont have enough ice I should give them more minutes, but they are serving it to the drive thru customers. So I asked them to refund my money which they did. I will never patronize them again.",1
Avoid drive thru like the plaque.  2nd night queueing for over 40 mins.,1
Terrible,1
this mcdonald's is not open 24 hours despite all signage and hours posted. an employee rudely shooed me away when i showed up at 1:30 AM.,1
"Visited 3 times over a week during a conference. This place is a shambles. The self-ordering system seems good until you realize that everything after is shambolic. Twice out of those 3 times it's taken more than 30 minutes to get a simple order, and it's not even been busy. The staff (especially the manager Martha) is aggressive and disengaged. Overall a truly terrible 'fast' food location.",1
Terrible,1
"Service was horrible they were very disrespectful, and not following covid protocols.",1
Slow drive thru,1
"This Asian guy on the second window asks me to drive to their parking area because the order is not ready and said he will bring it to me. I waited for 10 minutes in the car and he never brought it.  I decided to walk in the restaurant, they had the bag just laying there.

Why would he ask me to wait in the car if he never planned on bringing it to me??  Bad service!",1
"Poor service, rude attitude",1
"I waited 20 minutes until I got my food but the order was completely wrong. I ordered two double cheeseburgers and I got one with two patties and a glob of ketchup on it. The other just had a party with two dry pieces of bread on it. The fries were colder than a dead body in a freezer. What an absolute joke of a kitchen staff. Just a bunch of high school dropouts that cant even make a sandwhich correctly. If your reading this, just go buy some burgers and bread and make one yourself.",1
Stopped on my way to work at 6:15 in the morning drive thru full only about 5 people in the inside line . Waited bout 8 minutes no one took my order . Slow service and everyone speaking Spanish.  Walked out no food,1
"They did not give me my complete order, I made 3 order  of chicken deluxe and my order was missing fries whet back to made a complain and they were yelling at me and husband, this is not fear to the customer. People should be aware  of this  Mcdonald at Broadway and check their food properly before they leave drive thru. Those staff there are thief.",1
Friea old..,1

Very slow  don't go unless you want to kill 45 minutes.  People after me we're getting there food before me. NEVER AGAIN.,1
"Numerous people screaming at each other and almost getting physical, dirty tables, vandalized seats. Absolutely unacceptable and dangerous!",1
One of my worst experiences at a McDonalds ever.   I waited in a line at the drive through for 20  minutes.  Get to the first window where I hand them my card and end up paying for someone else's order.   Waited longer to correct that situation.  The order at the window was wrong.  Waited some more for that to be corrected.  Finally the lid to my soda wasn't on so when I went to grab it in the car the lid popped off the cup and spilled all over me.,1
This place might as well close at night with how long it takes,1
There were 10 people behind the register.  None of them can count to six? I did not order five nuggets. FYI. McDonald's on Washington Ave; the sweet requires sugar.,1
"You have never experienced a food establishment like this one before. Probably because they've all been shut down. I've been reluctantly stopping in this place while shopping in Macy's for many many years and it's the same experience everytime. At this point, I do it for the entertainment. The kiosk and ordering setup is a recipe for disaster, just forters. But you will usually wait 30-45 minutes just to be told that all the food and everything you ordered is sold out. If you're lucky enough to get your food, and it seems edible, there's 0% chance the dining room will be open. With all that said, it's not even the worst part. The staff are the craziest, rudest, nastiest human beings you will ever experience. They have zero filter. They scream and curse at eachother and the customers. One time I got yelled at for asking for sweet and sour sauce and they then proceeded to gather and talk about me asking for sweet and sour sauce, as if there's something wrong with that. After ignoring the request I asked again and she made an over exaggerated movement while rolling her eyes and putting her hand out, telling me it was $1. For 1 sauce. It was the best entertainment I've ever received for the money.",1
"Yesterday (2/3/2023), I stopped at Roanoke McDonald's to get breakfast.  I ordered the Big Breakfast with pancakes via kiosk.  My order was number 797, upon serving me my food I ask for an extra syrup.  The employee gave me the syrup but was very rude in telling me it cost .35 cents and next time include it in my order.  Without giving me a chance to explain he walked off.   To add to the bad service I discovered after leaving, my pancakes were cold.  I don't usually go to this McDonald's, and usually don't get bad service at McDonald's but figured I'd take the time to let others know how this McDonald's is treating it's customers!",1
"Had to wait for food in the back of  restaurant for ten minutes for food , then they forgot to me my fries!!",1
Slowest McDonald's ever..get these employees some help.!,1

This McDonald's was the worst i haver ever been in.  ZERO STARS. Floor in entrance was flooded. Bathrooms disgusting. Soda bar dirty and filthy with no ice. Garbage cans over flowing. 12 to 15 people inside with one person working the register. This after sitting in drive through fir 5 to 8 minutes without moving.,1
"This place was already slow, now the touch screen kiosks make it even worse",1
"Wow, just wow! Incredibly under staffed wich may have led to EXTREME rudeness.  Out of, or simply didnt want to put out the effect of giving, straws, cup holder and ketchup. And when asked for these items, straight out nasty about it! This mcdonald's is in parking lot of my hotel so really convenient but will NOT be revisiting!! If only 0 was a option..",1
"Very long line, most of the menu wasn't available for various reasons, no restrooms",1
"Since it's on the strip, prices are more expensive for example the $1 drink is like 1.89, they are multiple McDonalds within 2 miles that have regular pricing. Some of the staff seems to not have all of it down pact, had to wait several minutes for them to correctly enter no onions no pickles on the sandwhich.",1
"Worst McDonalds ever, they took forever, I stand in front of the counter like 8 minutes waiting for 2 sweet and sour sauce for my kids.",1
Slowest mcdonalds,1
Manager at this establishment is very disrespectful and doesn't want to do her job. Do to the fact of this the line was held up for over 30 minutes. Wouldn't recommend this McDonald's to anyone,1
No free refills. What a drag.,1
"This place is a god damn joke.  My girlfriend and I went for egg mcmuffins at 8:00pm on a saturday night, and it took over 20 minutes to get our order.  The food quality was horrendous, and no apology was given for the long wait.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS.  Seriously, I don't expect gourmet food from Mcdonalds, but this was truly disgusting.  One english muffin was so hard my girlfriend nearly broke a tooth on it  My egg mcmuffin hadn't even been toasted.  The staff was unfriendly and unapologetic.  What a joke, we are greatly disappointed in this location.",1
The worst McDonald's known to man. I would rather traverse the dmz nude than visit this monument to inefficiency. Visiting after 10pm? Only 8 value meals are available. And chances they get your order right with the reduced menu? 0.  Literally 0 for 6 in the 10 months I've lived close to this location. Save your sanity and Walk the extra distance to Alton and 16th and visit that location.,1

This McDonalds has really gone to **** ! The service? Ignored. After finally ordering? They don't take the time to bring you your order or even call out your damn number. Coffee sucks... Oh... And their security ..? Whoever is hiring them should be fired with their security. Total A-holes who treat you like you're loitering after 5 minutes... Total judgmental A-holes. DONT VISIT THIS MCDONALDS,1
"Ordered on Uber Eats, 4 different delivery person took the order but they all canceled since the food was never ready. They never finished my order after waiting for 2 hours. This is highly unacceptable, such a poor service for the location of the place. I expected something better from being one of the only McDonald",1

Terrible,1
Terrible service...,1
i am a tourist here . i came in the prices were already higher but that was fine the problem was the employees i ordered a rootbeer  but cashier didnt speak enough english to tell me he kept saying no ice. i stood there for 5 min waiting just a simple drink until another worker came over and explained they didnt have the drink and if id like to change. which i did pls retrain your employees and have someone with proper understanding at register so that theres no problem,1

"To whom it may concern. Your curb at the entrance of Hawian Bvld at International Drive is dangerous to cars turning right to park. The curb extends to far out to the drive and is blind to drivers in SUVs are high sitting vehicles. I can tell by the damage to the curb, that I'm not the first to experience this and damaged was caused. As a suggestion you may want to paint the curb bright red or install a Yellow caution post to alert drivers. The right think to do would be to correct it.",1

Worst service I ever experienced. I ordered one thing but cashier decided to sell me double of what he thought was better. When I asked for my money back Angel the shift manager was very rude verbally and physically. I will never be going to that establishment again.,1

Not 24 hours. Exposed. Change your hours,1
They had only one person workig the counter last night about 7:30. She wouldn't take a order until the one she was working on was filled.  It took for ever.,1

Terrible,1
"Terrible. In line for over an hour and my whole order was messed up. First they told me over the drive thru intercom that they don't do the coupon on the app then told me to pull around after taking my order. Make matters worse was the one worker kept scratching her hair, her hoody on her head, then take it off and scratch hair again. Not once did she wash her hands, but had the nerve to be mad at me because your coworker didn't ring up the order correctly. Definitely will not be coming back to this one. I'm glad I'm on my way back home to Texas, so I can get some Southern Hospitality.",1

I waited half a hour to get this sandwich and chicken nuggets. The sandwich looks like it was thrown together, way too much sauce. It was all over the entire sandwich and on the inside of the box that made the bread soggy. And to top it all off they gave me the head of lettuce and brown lettuce.",1
Mcchicken  missing chicken.,1

Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. The workers move in slow motion and ignore you. I had to wait 20 minutes just to pay for the food I ordered on the kiosk. My diabetic brother-in-law is shaking waiting for his food this long.,1
"Bad service and they always forget to put the complete order, there is always something missing even meat in the hamburger",1
Does not open when it says they are in the morning. Super disappointing every time i come here. Save your time and money and go somewhere else!,1
Super slow...we waited an extremely long time in the drive through.  People behind us were beeping and honking because no one was taking orders in one drive thru lane.,1
By far the worst McDonalds experience I've ever had. They locked their doors when their sign clearly said they were to be open; then the staff was incredibly rude.,1
"The food is good and the children's recreation area is very good but there is no supervision of any Mc Donald's staff to ensure that the play space is respected for children under 3 years of age. Big kids get into their space, push them, step over them and step on their parents do nothing or Mc Donald's. I never back with my kids",1

The order confirmation screen is broken, and the person taking orders apparently has not received training on reading back the order for accuracy. Three out of three times I have been to this location they have messed up something major on the order. The most recent time I got some serious attitude from the person taking orders. Spend a few extra minutes to another location or go to Burger King.",1
Worst Mcdonald's ever!!!! The homeless will attack you and the security will just stand there . stay in the casino if u want Mcdonald's not worth it!!!!,1
It use to be good but they got new owners and it like they are cutting corners to save money. Also the manager  just looks at you and not take your order,1

I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke. When I got to work I'm happy that I checked it before I bite into it because it had both. When I called them and spoke to the manager I was asked my name and to come back and they would replace it. I couldn't make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up. Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldn't go pick it back up. When I said the manager said it was OK the person that called me back said it was a different manager that I talked to and thistles manager said absolutely not. Which it was the same manager.

Food was great, but can't really give proper rating cause of this. I enjoy McDonald's, but I getting a bit feed up with the dining closure everywhere. Please do not reply due to pandemic, and safety, due to other establishment being open. I travel a lot on the road and soon will be passing up every McDonald's due to this. I stop because of the Kids. Disheartening once again.",1
Love mc Donald's,1

Guess what I'm the one who decides what, when and where do I buy something.",1

"Went today after the zoo, it was a very bad experience to say the least.
We were given over seasoned  fries, one straw for three drinks, and the drinks were all bad.
I thought how do you mess up a drink?
It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee.
She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction.
It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits, I mean really sour.
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries.
When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke... It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids!!

Long waits. I guess is not a drive thru anymore. Faster service if you walk inside,1

"It's unfortunate that after today,  I'll be going to the McDonald's on Beach. 3yrs here, 7 days a week I order a large mocha.   I've seen the management change about 7 people and I've made some friends.
All those people are gone. I made a direct complaint recently because I've had enough,  you'd think I'd go to a different McDonald's with ""that ""many issues right? Well, I don't think I should have had to drive further for their lack of customer service, but...its not changing. My complaint was handled fast and efficient. I come to retrieve my mocha and it tasted weird, a couple of days ago. I came back and was asked to park in 3 for it to be re made. I then gave it back to the lady and told her to please let the manager know I wasn't satisfied with the drink, we both laughed and she said ok.
Yesterday, I waited an hr because it was raining crazy...for a doordash. They gave the wrong item first and I had to reorder.
Today I go, and retrieve my mocha again, and the manager ask me how many were promised to me? I let her know,  the last one I came back and returned and told the girl somethings wrong with it,  it's taste burnt.  The gm says , I saw you yesterday and I know I gave you a free mocha. To me...that is calling me a liar. Especially when you repeat it after I tell you ,I didn't come yesterday,  I doordashed and yall messed that up. I also have dash receipts to show.
She then says I didn't call you a liar, but I know I gave you a free one. She then tells me her staff shared that I drive up without ordering. No. Have you ever experienced that? I'm here daily! When I told her her staff isn't at the window, just as she wasn't when I pulled up*today*  she said something was wrong with the speaker...No, accept some accountability.  The last manager told me she was Rosa and that's not the same lady I complained on. Anywho,  I told her I'm not the problem and I'm not sure why this hasn't been fixed yet,  but today I've decided to switch locations. lol drive further for good customer service, Rosa, thank you for at least responding today.

ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I get its only food but its fast food. We waited over thirty minutes for our food and should be called slow food. We waited at the drive thru first and no one was taking orders then we went inside and had to order on the kiosk because they told us too. Why h,1
"The boy at the register was rude, the manager wasn't much better and the dining area was a mess.",1
"Please review the receipt showcasing what I ordered along with the pictures of what I have received. This is the most disgusting order I have ever received. Aside from it being completely incorrect, the products arrived COLD. The fries are soaked in oil and hard because they have probably been sitting outside all day. The sandwiches are not fully cooked and COLD. The drinks are disgusting. Ive never seen anything like this and they are not even full. I",1
"Still waiting... 25 minutes if you are looking for FAST food, think about other place",1
Patties were raw and uncooked took 20 minutes to get ahold of someone then get told to call back later. Threw the burger away and made ramen instead!,1
"A mess all trash overflowing cashier more worried about who didn't come to work . I expected better from this md,s by the zoo. Clean up people.",1
"Well earlier today. I placed 2 separate orders, but when I arrived there doors were locked, there was no letter or any sort of notice explaining why, but what confuses me more is they had people inside ordering and sitting down inside not happy with that location!!",1
"Very bad customer service, i didn't even get a thank you. They  made me way long time for my order",1
"This place is the worse!!! I went in @ 10:24 and just getting out 11:07 just for 3 sausage Mcgriddles , 2 hash browns, and a large orange juice and the young cashier left and went and stood outside for a bit then came back in,, the floors are nasty, the ppl have attitude, the drive thru is always crowded overflow into the traffic, ,,,, I have to void this place and move to a peaceful place in the morning for breakfast, ,,you suck McDonald's WHY!!!!",1
"There were items on the menu they did not have, they  only 3 costumers in the lobby and it still took almost 30 mins. The people ordered before came back twice because items were left out the bag and/or order was wrong.My food was cold but I couldn't stay any longer. This is not the first time I had a bad experience at this location, I feel they need a new manager that can take care of business w/ employees, costumer service, and overall cleanliness. Lastly the young  lady that waited on me/us was very sweet and apologetic.
Thanks",1
2nd time coming and same quality kind of food. Stale fries so dry so black. The sweet iced tea tastes like someone did not clean it before making the drink. Time stamp 12:50 pm.  I warn everyone do not eat here.,1
very bad service,1
"We just tried to come through the drive thru it's 11:49 pm the car infront of us got to order , we pull up and the gentlemen tells us your closed ? I would understand if you didn't just take the order of the car infront of us. YOU CLOSE AT MIDNIGHT NOT 11:50 ! If your gonna close early and deny service,  deny service to everyone 10 minutes early !!",1
Terrible,1
Lots of homeless. Very creepy. DIRTY restroom.,1
Service here is horrible every time,1
"Horrible, the hamburger does not taste like anything, I like Burger King better",1
They always messing up orders and my quarter pounder was ridiculous,1
"They used to have average customer service and take forever in the drive thru. Now the customer service is also bad. The lady at the drive thru can not get my order right for the life of her and is just rude. I mean it's convenient for me as it's on my way to work but if you can avoid it, do yourself a favor!",1
Probably the most unprofessional staff ever. They tried to justify they close early by multiple  reasons and ,1
This place needs more attention and better management employees only do is play around flirt with each other and scream too much and the also have no hat or any hair net on the kitchen staff the only person I saw with a hair net is the cleaning lady,1
Very rude manager. Really bad customer service.,1
"Was told my order was being prepared. Waited for 20 min, then was told they didnt have my order. These people here are patheti",1
We were inside a Walmart McDonald's. My granddaughter has food allergies to egg & dairy. So there are only a few things that she can have. We had ordered her a kids happy meal with apple slices but they gave us french fries instead. The beef frying oil has dairy in it so she can not have the french fries and they were all out of apple slices. Next we ordered apple juice. They were all out of apple juice as well. The girl employee that was trying to help us did not believe me that the french fries had dairy in it. A happy meal hamburger and apple slices is all she can have here. Was not happy with the service here. The food and service times are not the same as it used to be.,1
"Extremely slow service, one cashier with multiple people working slowly in the back, a line up to and out the door, and the drive through wrapped around the building. Avoid late at night.",1
"Store says open 24 hour, but employees, blasting music says that they're not open?? Beware, lazy employees. Boycotting this location.",1
These people are slow as hell. I waited for 20 minutes for some yogurt. 20 minutes!! Don't come here until they hire better people,1
"Never gave me the drinks I ordered. Gave me the wrong ones and never bothered to rectify my complaint. Very disorganized. The woman who I complained to was very bad mannered, didn't have good customer service skills.",1
Their sprit soda tastes just as faucet water.,1
"What a joke! Parking is awkward, went and asked for breakfast - they were out of muffins. Okay... asked me to wait a few minutes they'llt lunch at 10:30. Come up there at 10:30 on the dot - they tell me they won't serve lunch until 10:45-10:50, because they still have breakfast food left???? I didn't know the cashier's decide when to serve lunch now!",1
"Doesn't deserve one! Waited in line 30 minutes. When we finally ordered the girl couldn't get the order right after 3 attempts. When we got to the pay window, the girl was talking on her cell phone. When I asked her to repeat my order, she looked at me crazy. When we got our order it was disgusting. Soggy oily fries, burned chicken nuggets, water down soda ... plain disgusting. They need new management for sure!!! Someone please contact corporate!!!!!",1

"The attention is terrible, a shame they don't care about the customers, they leave the orders adrift, annoying people. The worst in attention avoid this mac donald",1
The filth of the bathrooms is impressive. It is not possible to think that an internationally renowned chain maintains the bathrooms in that state.,1
Horrible I ordered two mcDoubles plain pickles only and on attempt #1 I received two with everything on #2 I received a mcDouble pickles only and a single patty hamburger.attempt #3 I took the hamburger back and received a double hamburger.. So I asked for a refund..which I received.. But what really shocked me was the attitude I received for trying to have my order corrected. Bad business,1
This place is dangerous!  Filled with shady characters.  No security.,1
They have music as if it were a disco. Here you can not eat you go crazy.,1
I walked in the door with my son in-law to order inside because it said dining room open till 3am.  It was 1am 3-22-2022.  We went to every kiosk none working.  We walked up to register.  A woman back towards the back yelled out that they were closed.   Well we walked out got in our van pulled up to drive through.    Nobody responded.  We turned off engine a waited a bit.  Nobody.  We left and visited Wendy's drive thru.,1
"Waited in drive-thru for 30 mins, finally got up to order & nothing. We kept asking if anyone is there. Kid finally comes on that they had to reboot the system & could be another 15 mins at least. We told him he needs to tell people as there is a line around the building. Truly horrible service.",1
there is no good service,1
"Lacking in customer service.  Wouldn't substitute steak for sausage in big breakfast. Even after we said we would pay extra. Biscuits were hard. Bathroom was nasty!
Only good thing worth the one was the coffee!!",1
Every mcdonalds in miami is the same,1
The employees at this location are ridiculously lazy. It's 6pm and the drive-thru menu is still on the breakfast side. It shouldn't take more than 2 minutes to flip the menu over to the lunch side.,1
"Very bad service, pushing customers out of their parking lot in half an hour!",1
"McDonald's generally sucks out loud. This one is even worse. I don't think the drive thru has ever gotten an order correct. They're constantly running out of staple items i.e. they don't have fries at the ready or the shake machine is busted. If that's not bad enough, it's a hang out for the local homeless. And not decent homeless...the methed out violent type.",1
"Terrible, floor was disgusting and no one cleaned it after asking, even the tables were left a mess that my family had to clean ourselves. Unfriendly atmosphere and employees looked at us in anger despite just walking in. Would not recommend anyone this establishment",1

Horrible service walked in with wife an 3 kids ordered 3 pancake meals an 2 sandwich meals 5 people 5 meals they called our order got 1 pancake 2 sandwiches no full meals had to wait as they dissed us in Spanish (I speak it I know what you said) then get my other 2 pancakes but they absolutely refused to give me 2 hash browns will not stop again,1
So dirty,1
I feel like I'm in a disease front line Battlefront when there's no bathroom I mean what are they thinking about Public Safety are they thinking that not being sanitary is okay?,1
"Long wait at drive thru despite one car in front of me. 15 minutes to get a fish sandwich and drink. Sandwich was disgusting and wound up throwing it
Out. Staff seemed confused as my order sat on the counter with workers waking past it many times before they finally gave it to me.",1
"Forgot my fries, out of one meal. Ouch.",1
The worst McDonalds I have been to. Waited at the pick up window for awhile to be served ,1
I park into the parking lot I see 2 vans full of homeless people's junk. I walked in the MacDonald's bathroom one of the stalls was full of poop. Later I got my food . Was in my car ready to leave then I smelled poop   on my hands. The entrance door had poop from the person's hand. But on the bright side they gave me an extra meal for free. But the cleaning service was not good.,1
Same thing applies for any McDonald's short staff food is expensive and not prepared properly it seems like they cannot get the order right,1
"Do not come here. It is not worth it. The food never comes out hot or fresh, the employees are extremely rude, and the wait times are extremely long regardless of the time of day.",1
"I move close to this unit, ordered via app to avoid the drive thru line, but for my surprise when I went to get my order that was ready I was forced to take an hour in the drive thru line.

This is supposed to be fast food.

When I went to pick up my order, the drinks were wrong, the potatoes were the wrong size and old, the Sundae machine was broken, they didn't deliver our sundaes and the attendance was super rude, saying that the problem was mine and not hers, burgers were in the correct Double Quarter Ponder box but when we got home, there were cheeseburgers and the third burger wasnt in the bag!!

The amount charged on my card by the Mc Donalds app was greater than the closing of the order.

I made a complaint to customer service that notified the unit but unfortunately no concrete action will be taken.

Never had a more disappointed experience estaurant again!",1
"I ordered several times from this store but recently last order I made, the burger tasted like someone throw tobacco ash into it. It tasted wired. That",1
Very crowded you will probably catch covid from the first 60 seconds of being in here you can't even walk in here too many people it seems like the kids get out of school and go here too and terrorize the place,1
Terrible,1
Supervisor is a mean person that every time she has a argument somebody get hurt is really incompetent and if I'm lying look for all there latest news. And you will find tha the first with her and a client and it end security harming people. I am so sorry to say this. I was a suing manager in McDonald's when I was younger and there are better ways to handle situations.,1
Terrible,1
"The worst experience I've ever had in my life!! With saying that I could not taste the food! A restaurant where the staff yells at you is not worthy of being visited by ANYONE!! Sure, I must be specific! It was in this specific place, but they should take action!!",1
Worst Mcdonalds I've ever been to. They take forever and horrible customer service.,1
"Please hire employees that actually want to work and like their job and smile this girl that just took my order with extremely long red Nails was very unpleasant. Do you follow a dress code in this establishment? Also this must be the saddest sundae i have ever received, half the Carmel was outside the cup!  Maybe that",1
I ordered a caramel machiatto and it tasted really spoiled. Last time I will be visiting here.,1
They do not clean or stock the bathroom employees just sitting around eat here at your own risk,1
"worse burger and drink ever, that is the reason I never eat here",1
Cancelled my order today due to the fact this location doesn't serve water. Cancelled my family's order. How can I wash this greasy food down if cant even buy water here. Blows my mind,1
Worst service at a mcdonalds ever and homeless people vacate the toilet.,1
Horrible McDonalds and they charge yo,1
The food wasn't fresh and over cooked,1
"This location was awful today. They rang up our order wrong, then gave it to us still wrong. Took over 15 min to get our order and we had to ask for our drink cups so we could at least get our drinks while waiting. As we stood there, we saw almost every person have a problem with their orders. The person at the register was messing up every order and the back kept making the wrong things. Worst visit ever.",1

"If I could give 0, I would.
Food: not fresh, not the right configuration
Staff: dude handed me an oreo Mcflurry without making sure the cap was on properly and it went all over my car. Asked for a manager and he said there was none.... ok dude, if you say so.
Drive-thru menu: half the screen was off and the drive thru lady could not comprehend that - even as I pulled into the store and told her. She didn't get what was happening.

I can't believe McDonald's would let a franchisee get away with this location's issues.",1
"No drink refills.
Bad service ",1
Terrible service place was super nasty. Homeless people in the drive thru window talking to employees,1
"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I've tried it several times, mostly because it's on the way to my work...but after today, honestly, I'd rather skip breakfast all together. I got a completely soggy hash brown, soggy all the way around. I got a small caramel frappe with a shot of espresso. They put the espresso on the bottom and just poured the Frappe on top, so all I got was espresso when I first tried it. To add insult to injury, they put it in a small cup and dumped the rest out (it should have been in a medium cup). I worked at a McDonald's for over 2 years and this one does not follow procedures at all",1
"Management sucks, sent someone home, claimed he wasn't doing anything but he was assisting me with an order. I had two different ordered and got refunds on both. Two thumbs down for Erin",1
"The night shift crew and their unknown secret supervisor, a white Hispanic lady will refuse completing ubereats orders at times. They will lie to the customer that the Ubereats delivery person has cancel the order and they will lie on the other end to the ubereats delivery person that the customer has cancel the order.
They will also refuse to answer the phone calls from ubereats support.
Finally, they will give the ubereats driver a bad rating of unprofessionalism for not canceling the order.",1
Terrible,1
Went in this morning they got my order all wrong charged me more then what its suppose to cost . When I brought ,1
"Terrible service, unfriendly staff, dirty and half of the time the ice cream machine is broken.
Management does not care about customer service at all.",1
The drive through guy was super disrespectful and awful to deal with. We had ordered online and they said it didn't go through even though it charged us so instead of providing a solution he stooding not saying anything. As well as when we got the food and asked if that was all and he rolled his eyes and said nothing. Absolutely one of the worst experiences in a drive through. 0,1
Horrible service. young cashier had addittude. Didn't want to give me the stuff I needed the cashier was in a bad mood. When I was eating my fries I noticed a fry was really black and dirty like it had fell on the floor and they picked it back up. Nasty.,1

"Undercooked, cold in the middle......",1
"Not open 24 Hours.  Even the website says open 24 hours, but trying to navigate McDonald's website to contact them was impossible.",1
All McDonald's are horrible. Always get bad service and the food is never quite what you expect. The only reason they're in business is because they are on the corner when you need them.,1
Took my 3 year old here to eat and play in the play place. There was a homeless man sitting in there with his no socks or shoes on. Multiple employees walked by him without saying anything,1

QUALITY? Yeah right

SERVICE? They don't know what that means...

Hey somebody do something there, and remember HEALTHY DEPARTMENT IS AROUND THE CORNER!!!",1
Id give it zerots if I could. The drive through only had two cars ahead of me to order and in total it took an hour. It took ten minutes no exaggeration at the order board for someone to take my order. When i get to the window he didnt know what i had and literally just then put my order in. It was not that busy at all and it had at least 4 people working. At the window he took my card for about two minutes and i froze my bank account just in case,1
"The manager is rude and speaks to her employees in spanish to insult customers,  Security guard was creepy",1
Bad service for everything,1
"Terrible customer service, the lady at the drive-thru was handing me someone else order after me telling her my order is an online order she then got mad and left the window then the second young lady told me to go to the third window without telling me that they just received my order and is in the process of making it. I called the store and the manager was nasty after I was just telling him that Communication would have been nice and yelling at me telling me I dont need to tell him that and I asked for corporate number and the lady said they dont have it and I asked for her name and she walked away quickly from me rude everyone here is rude and disrespectful and no communication with there customers.

I would recommend going to a different location thats mo",1
"I'llt with the positive: The food I received was the correct order and it was hot. The bad: What was supposed to be a 10 minute trip ended up being almost 40 because they were severely understaffed, and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone. Maybe they're better during the day, but definitely stay away from the midnight shift if you're looking to get in and out.",1
I got my order wrong twice first they gave me coffee instead of hot chocolate and then I said no ketchup on my burger and it had ketchup probably not going there again,1
Worst drive thr ever,1
This was a horrible experience food was good though but homeless people taking up the tables here and there wasn't but bout 10 tables to begin with also prices were stupid hi,1
Poor Quality food,1
"I just watched a vagrant peeing in a cup while eating my breakfast. He then dumped his piss cup out on the sidewalk. For God's sake ppl stop handing out money to hobos it just makes the issue worse. He wasn't even handicapped, yet he sat in a wheelchair. I watched him for an hour. When he didn't get any money from passing customers he stood up and walked away with his ""Help Please"" sign. This McDonalds is filled woth hobos often and I won't be back.",1
"We waited 15 minutes for our food, then when we recieved our food, the fries were cold. The fish sandwich tasted like it was microwaved and the new chicken sandwich tasted like rubber",1

This isnt the first time it happens but its definitely the one that bothered me the most. Went for lunch did a mobile order to make  it quick and spent 20 minutes of my 30 minute lunch waiting for my food. Had to walk in and ask for it. No napkins or st,1
Awful employees they all talk way to much to one another instead of getting their jobs done. None of them work together to accomplish any work task and who ever works the front ordering station is not well at their job,1
Past service has been good until recently went in stood for about three minutes at the counter while olga laughed and giggled it took a person from the back to ask me did I need help  and take my order and no it was not busy,1
"After visiting with a friend quite a distance from our home this past week, we stopped off at this McDonalds location to get us a late night dinner. I really wanted an Oreo McFlurry and was willing to even settle for some fresh baked or classic McDonald character bag of cookies, but they said that their ice cream machine was down and they were completely out of any and all cookies (sad face). As we pulled away from the drive-thru and continued on our way to our final destination, we realized that they gave us the wrong order. We spent about $20, but only received maybe $5 worth of food. The lobby was closed, the line was long, and we were too tired to turn back. I tried calling this location more than 3 times and even submitted a complaint/help request via the McDonalds app to try and get some sort of resolution to their mistake, yet I still have notignoring all of my attempts?",1
"My girlfriend and her friends visited this establishment on 04/16/23 at around 12:50AM. An African American worker in a grey shirt (Male) with braided hair was incredibly racist to her and her friends, using an Asian accent when talking to them. He was originally on the side and took over the register from one of his coworkers on purpose with the intent of being completely racist to them. He spoke with an Asian accent ridiculing their race and telling them he can serve them for an extra $5.00. While this was happening, all of the other employees laughed and egged him on. My girlfriend and her friends felt very unsafe, especially late at night. We will try filing a police report today with the local precinct and hope this employee faces consequences.",1
Very bad service,1
Long waiting !!! Never ever come in drive thru... more thn 30 mins still in line ... there is no discussion regarding food bcos it's mc dddd,1
"Says 24/7. Mobile app allows for drive through order. Lights are all on and drive through speaker is active. But nobody is working. Location is closed, no sign, no disabling online orders, nothing.",1
"Slow. All. The. Time. I have never come to this location and quickly got my good and out, it's always this long process (just for my order to be wrong).  I wish they put in the attention to detail that the Studio City location puts in.",1
"This is the worst Mc. Donalds that I have ever visited. Sadly, this is the only one which is near my home and sometimes I don't have options to chose another one but, today, was the last straw. I made an order through the app and selected the pickup at the Drive Thru but when I got to the screen where we should order, the girl who was there didn't know what to do with my Order Code and when I got to the window and ask for it they didnt know anything neither and they pretended that I went inside because they do not dispatch mobile order by there. Also told me that the payment had not come through and I requested to cancel the order but, 3 minutes later I was charged with the order that I never got so, Im  making this complain because I am pretty upset and disappointed because I always eat in Mc. Donalds but in this store is always the same disgusting and poor service at all time or unless when I have gone: mornings and nights. Also, I disputed the charge you made to my credit card because, as you noticed, I never got it.",1
Terribly slow service the drive through experience was AWFUL!,1
"This McDonald's is slow and they're always messing up your order..you go through the drive for fast service, only to have to wait 10 to 15 minutes for your food...AFTER you've already waited 10 minutes in line to pay..its ridiculous..",1
One of my worst experiences at a McDonalds ever.   I waited in a line at the drive through for 20  minutes.  Get to the first window where I hand them my card and end up paying for someone else's order.   Waited longer to correct that situation.  The order at the window was wrong.  Waited some more for that to be corrected.  Finally the lid to my soda wasn't on so when I went to grab it in the car the lid popped off the cup and spilled all over me.,1
OMG!!!  Last time I order 3 double cheeseburger  they look like they were sitting there for hours. So this time I ask the girl that I want my burgers fresh so they come up with the brilliant idea of putting the burgers and the fries in the microwave so they would be nice hot and fresh,1
Asked me to wait at spot one. Asked for jelly and was completely ignored. Had to go inside to get it myself. Trash customer service. I blame management for not holding anyone accountable.,1
Why is show online lite a time open I pay many time then I came here it,1
"Not fast food, actually it's slow food.",1
I ask for some extra fries with the order and they did not gave it to me,1
This MCD need a serious improvement.  The fast food is extremely slow + their ordering in line is horrible.   You end up waiting over 5 min to place an order then 10 min to get it.   #HORRIBLE,1
"Very dirty.  Cold food.  Somebody peed in the play area.  Management was informed, but nobody cleaned it up.",1
"This location has gone to hell in a hand basket. Since they changed ownership it seems like management doesn't care anymore. They're ALWAYS out of something, Orange juice in the morning, frappe mix, ice cream machine is ALWAYS broken, the self serve kiosks are always off line, the tables are dirty and don't get meted on the bathroom",1
Today they see me inside waiting for orden and no body attend me today 7/22/21 time 6:27 am they look at me 3 time and don't ask can I help you..and the male manager he see me and ignore me..I like this mcdonal I'm the truck driver I coming every day but this male is not good..and  I left with hungry..!!!,1
"Any food from McDonald's upset but stomach I've had some in West Virginia,(Houston & Hillsboro)Texas, and Oklahoma all made me sick",1
"Avoid at all cost, they always pull you forward even if you got a simple order. Rude staff do not come here",1
"They were very rude and food was cold. They refuse to let us inside and made us wait 10 mins for three sandwiches and when it was time to get the food two people were VERY RUDE. Next time I'm in town I'll never go to this McDonald's. They were slow, rude, and not friendly.",1
"Gross.  Trash overflowing.  Really bad. McDonald's Corp should refund my money.  Pay bathrooms were a nice touch.  Obviously, there is a problem with the homeless.  Here is a solution...HIRE the homeless... This McDonald's needs all the help it can get!",1
"Cold fries, the order was wrong n missing items .",1
I overheard the man standing at the window outside because it wouldn't open the door for people to eat inside to say if the people out there,1
"When i go to Mc donald i eat every time crispy chicken
Crispy Chicken was best but this chicken was not cook well",1
Always missing food,1
The cashier ignored me 4/2 minutes and then finally whenever I asked if they were going to take my order she rolled her eyes and took my order and then I'm not sure if they just forgot to make my order or accidentally handed it out the window but after about 20 minutes I asked where my order was and none of the employees had any idea. I had to repeat what I had ordered about three different times and then about ten minutes later I got my food. I was on a lunch break at work a my entire brake was spent being ignored and waiting on food to be remade. I will never visit this status men again.,1
2:42 AM on a Saturday and they just straight up stopped answering the drive through. They just sitting in there chilling,1

"They've gotten my order incorrect three times. I normally order the same thing all the time: two steak and cheese bagels and a mango smoothie. One time they gave me two sausage bagels. The next time they gave me two sausage bagels with egg and cheese. The third time they gave me two steak and cheese bagels with egg. When I tried to call the number on the receipt, it goes to some corporate number who never returned my call.",1
Slowest service ever! I haven't taste the food but i hope is not bad!,1
Worst McDonald's ever... not even in Mexico you can fine attention like this. Disgusting.,1
"Went through the drive through ordered a large fry and two chicken deluxe sandwiches
Got to the pay window and the read it back as two spicey chicken sandwiches
I restated that I wanted the deluxe crispy chicken sandwich
They said they would fix it after having to pay a second time for the lettuce and tomato then when I got the order it was still a spicey chicken sandwich INSIDE a deluxe crispy chicken b",1

"Worst McDonald's in santa Monica  ,  every time I order they always get my order wrong and the miss count my exact change just a bunch of special ed kids in there running the place",1
I get about half a box of fries every time i go. Its really frustrating how stingy they can be with french fries. I order a large and get less than a small. Also I'm very upset with the price changes of already overpriced trash.,1
too many crazy loud screaming street people. very dirty.,1

It was filthy,1
No leadership to teach how to run business!!!!!!,1
Worst experience ever!! They closed the lobby early!! Then the manager found out people were still coming in andted yelling!! The nice officer apologized for her attitude and gave us complimentary drinks for patiently waiting for our burger. She needs to go over a customer service training again or find another job!!,1
This place is not open 24/7. Please adjust your expectations accordingly,1

"Cold burgers disgusting looking and tasting meat, the fries were the only ",1
"Two giant women who stay at the early hours refused me service just because the order was large. They invented that cards weren't working, but a customer had recently passed a card. Both lazy and aggressive behavior. A fat white woman and a black woman. At 5 am there are almost no stores open, I had to get hungry. Never again will I go to this place! I don't know how the franchise owner allows this type of employee on site.",1
HORRIBLE SERVICE. LIKE REALLY BAD. GO OUT OF YOUR WAY AND FIND ANOTHER NEARBY MCDONALDS,1
Mediocre service always crowded,2
Poor ,2
Just okay,2
Depends on the worker that you get can either be really nice or really rude! What can you expect from McDonalds in oak cliff?!,2
"Used a deal at the kiosk for a free kids meal w/ combo purchase and when I went to check out it said ""Deal is unavailable"" & wiped out the order forcing me to re-enter everything and the deal code was now invalid. I get that they are for ""participating locations"", but if you're not a participating location, put up a sign or something so I don't waste my time.
The drink fountain was closed 'to keep the restaurant clean' according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said ""We don't do refills here"". What? Seriously? Unlike every other McDonald's? You're gonna give me the saltiest fries ever and then make me pay for a refill? Again, if that is this location's policy, fine. But post a sign so that the expectation is set",2
It's still just McDonald's.,2
"I have to do this cause I'm upset with McDonald's as a former employee but also a business partner (if you can call Doordash a business partner)

They don't pay enough, so the employee turnover rate is high or they just don't show up, they have seemingly no limits on how many delivery and mobile orders people can place so they get backlogged, swamped, and can't keep up.

I parked, called, told them I had an order and they said to get in the drive thru. By the time I got to the window; they hadn't evented the order. It took 20 minutes in total. I lost money waiting on McDonald's.

Seriously, reformat your business structure. It was embarrassing working here and apologizing for the ineptitude of this company.

Be nice to the employees, it's not their fault. I'm not even sure it's the manager's fault, but they have to tell their higher ups about this.",2
"I've been here many times, usually after midnight as I work late. Recently, the majority of the times I've gone through the drive through they say that they're closed, but when I ask what their hours are they say ""oh we're just closed for an hour""- this has happened to me at 2am last night, 4am last week, etc.

My issue is with the restaurant claiming to be open 24h even though it definitely isn't.",2
Using the drive thru ? Check your orders !,2
Very very slow in the mornings and employees are not too friendly,2
Order is wrong everytime i have went or missing items!,2
extremely busy/highly understaffed. waited 1 hr in drive thru (last resort) for my food. this is not fast food.,2
No refills on drinks owner keeps ac on low making it hot inside. School kids sit at all seats taking up space and are noisy.,2
"The employee's are nice, location is always dirty. Tables have to be clean more often. The food quality has gotten better.",2
"Staff was not friendly,  food was marginal and slow, no bathroom.",2
I'm from the area so I have been going here for years. It's so so.,2
"My brother and I tolerate it because it's close to us and it's open when no one else is.  But. .. you get the loonies showing up there. Homeless wandering in and out filling up for free their gutter cups at the soda machine. Smells, psych ward cryouts and who knows what else are the norm so do yourself a favor and order by the drive through and get the hell out quick.",2
"Unfortunately today while waiting in line (pulled to the side not in the drive through lane) my frappe was given to the person behind me. She graciously didn't take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it. I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back. I was very confused by this, especially in Covid times. I requested a different drink, no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe. The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again. Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this ",2
Always very disappointing. I've gone to this McDonald's for 15 years now. The system has gotten more organized since the recent renovation but it seems the efficiency still has not improved. The workers are nice and willing to help. The seating area is much better. The biggest issue would be the lack of efficient service. I've seen people leave after ordering because it would take so long. Hopefully it'll be improved.,2
Poor ,2
"Manager sucks. I called her over for help and she ignored me. Seating arrangements are disorganized. The soda fountain machine is always dirty. Hardly any ice. When you press for a certain soda, it runs water for a while. Too many homeless people. The only decent thing here is the food.",2

Classic fast food,2
"Dont think we got a reciept
We like to come to this place after work, because we got off around 12. This hasn't just happened to say but; we ordered 2 Mcdoubles, a breakfast sandwich and a mcchicken. Instead of the Mcdoubles we got 2 mcgriddles. At this point with how many time my order has been wrong I should just have to stop to the side and check, cuz I don't think we got a receipt",2
Slow,2
On McDonalds I've ever been to that has a security guard. Does not let you pee before you order. Other than that the place is clean and fine.,2
Food was not hot fries to salty,2
They force you to order from a kiosk while employees just stand around.  In fact the busiest person there was the one telling people to use the kiosks to order.  I had to ask three times for my drink cup.,2

Poor ,2
It's a McDonald's....But there's a bad homeless problem in and around this place.  Most times you'll be asked for money by people hanging around this location.,2
"I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries. I even heard them making comments about the free coupon. Also the women at the window seem to be fooling around too much hence the extremely long line during lunch and dinner times. I stopped by 4 times in one week and had an issue each time.

The young white guy at the first window is really nice though hence the 2 instead of 1",2
How do you miss a patty on a big mac? -_- First time going there too.,2
Only stop here if you have to.,2
"They disabled the order kiosks by taking away all the number tents and requiring them. Then i get in a line, which is designed to handle the overflow, not the whole store... 2 cashiers and 25 people. Nice long wait. Then, they didn't give my mcflurry a mix at all. If i wanted a cup of vanilla ice cream with oreo topping, i wouldn't have ordered a mcflurry.",2
We have the food all wrong. The manager charged for what was missing in the order. Is not the first time. Oh well they need to improve costumer service.,2
Too dependant on technology... Cashier's expect you to use kiosk. No team members at registers.,2

I finish work at 12am so i have literally no other option cause i am exhausted and not willing to drive further. Burgers are dry, patties are old, i got 4 nuggets instead of 6. In short, dont waste your money cook yourself at home.",2

Pricing is getting out of hand as well.  Can go to red Robin for $5 more and sit down to eat.",2

"I went through one of the drive thru lanes last night, and waited for about 15 minutes as they only took orders from the other lane. I was not able to back up my car, so I went forward to ask what was up. When I got to the only window open, they said they were only taking orders from one side. I suggested they put up a sign, and asked if could take my order at the window, they said I would have to go through the drive thru again. I am not going here anymore for this, in addition to the times they got my order wrong.",2
Food was not fresh and the prices have gone up!,2
Steak egg and cheese bagel is not good.,2
It does not have a drink refill...,2
Does anyone ever expect to go there for the awesome food and beyond superior customer service? Nope. It's the only place with a decent sausage biscuit without having to drive to Carl JR's in cedar park.,2

Needed to be cleaner I dining area place...had to grab something before grabbing bus greyhound but food was hot and behind counter was ok.,2
Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about 20 minst to finish. For being a fast food they are super slow. They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job. My French fries were cold. One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong. I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people.,2
Ordered two Mcdoubles...one with ketchup only the other plain. The one with ketchup was so messy you couldn't even handle it and the other wasn't plain. The order was printed correctly on the receipt. Are these employees just not able to read?,2
"Update: it's so frustrating to eat here! There is a virtual army of panhandlers from the nice guy who opens the door for you to the more aggressive ones that approach you as you order, or eat your food.

Rest room was out of order in such a popular location,2
Ordered a meal the only thing that was bad was a fries there were hard felt like I was chewing on rocks never get fries here especially at night time,2
By far one of the dirtiest McDonald's I've ever been to. 10 dirty tables the entire time we were there. No hand sanitizer...,2
Very hot in the play area and it also smells like it's never cleaned.,2
Nasty to many homeless person inside,2
Poor quality and mediocre service.,2
"I ordered my food for pick up, and when I walked into the restaurant, it was cluttered with guests meandering about, which I understood the behavior after MY 45 minute wait, that was AFTER I waited 8 minutes to even be acknowledged by an employee. So frustrating, staffing seemed adequate, just a lack of experience in prioritizing from the young manager.",2
Ok,2
This Mcds is average. Ok service with ok food. Nothing exceptional with this Mcds.Only positive is they seem to be slightly faster than most but on a negative I ask for a type of salad dressing I usually get the wrong dressing. Happened multiple times.,2

"Customer service pm is awful, on morning  regularly personnel is better",2

He has no concept whatsoever of customer service. He pointed at me andted demanding me to walk over to him because of a mistake he made. He",2
"Very busy. Very dirty. One cashier and at least 10 people working. Line was long, the boy taking orders was moving at half the speed of smell.

I watched four groups walk out. We should have followed.",2

"Fries tasted stale, one of the ordered 10 piece nugget only had 9, they forgot Any of the two flavored sauces requested (2 of the 10 piece nuggets were in the order). Just not a great day to go to McD's I guess...",2
Not to crazy about,2
The McDonald's app keeps malfunctioning. It says you've used the deal when you haven't.,2
"We went here on June 6, 2023. We tried a little bit of everything.
Ordered a Philly cheesesteak, pepperoni pizza, kids meal, big Mac meal and 2 mcdoubles.

The wait was absolutely ridiculous and when they brought us the food it was ice cold. We didn't complain because the lines were super long and nobody was around to help. The one guy picked up my daughter's kids meal thought it was trash and I told him and he said he was sorry and walked off.
The arcade was just a mad house. So busy and very dirty so was the restrooms. We don't be going back that's for sure.",2
Poor ,2

Just needed caffeine. The staff at the drive thru just shoved the drink in my hands. Not very professional.,2

Food is too salty.,2
This location isn't very clean and has a bad odor,2
Fast food.,2
"While using kiosk, it made many selections for me I did not choose. Had to delete many things from order, got frustrated and just put it in. It was too busy at the counter for the personnel to answer my question, she informed me there were customers in front of me. Being hungry and tired, this was more frustrating than it should have been",2
"Do you really need to be reading a review of McDonald's? Customer service and McFlurry availability is hit or miss, but the food is the same as any other McDonald's anywhere in the US, except that one that still has pizza.",2
Closer when posted 24 hours :-(,2
"Dont think i would go here on my own, a lot of vagrants about. Not very clean, food was ok.",2
Missing 1 large French Fries. Wrong honey mustard instead of sweet and sour (had to pay 10 cents per sauce packet. Very slow service. The slow service might be that more time is put into closing the bag with tape than it takes to prepare the food. The only reason they get any is because they were super polite.,2
So. Really slow.,2
"Slow employees, not being really kind, to many uber eats before you, not too much attention on the place being clean.",2
There burgers has gotten worse than ever but their fries are still good.,2
It's fast food.,2

I ordered 20 spicy,  40 reg, picked out at least 9 different dipping sauces as ""required "" not to mention Desired by my kiddos!! We did NOT get ONE sauce or even a ketchup!!! Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard, they didn't even give us straws either to go with our $3 mango smoothies...2 of them! So, 60 Nuggets-NO sauces  AT ALL!  Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious!",2
"This morning 10/11/2022, went through the drive thru for my breakfast.  Two things medium Hot mocha plain and sausage mcmuffin. Paid and advanced to the next window.  Here is where things went wrong!
The blue shirt manager  ( last name begin with an A) on duty Had a serious attitude.  She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong order. She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my order. I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee . She said the there is no coffee on the order. I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to me. Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE CUP.  Which is her job .
Her Words loud and clear
""FOR GOD SAKE""
I know I only spent a few dollars but IT don't justify getting attitude because this is your job.
I ask for a refund..",2
No dollar menu here on the strip,2

Cheap bugers,2
"Missing items in order #1606 on 07/23/2022. You guys need to pay attention, it",2
Very disappointed that there was no indoor seating. Doors were locked. Drive-thru only. Needed to sit at a table and eat. Decided to eat elsewhere.,2
Food precooked and dried out like always. Commercial lies. Nothingcooked when u order.,2
There is a security guard/cop standing around and he makes me feel unsafe for some reason. A black bum was harrassing me and tell cop looked on. It's not walker friendly as there is a gate around the outside. At least it was clean on the inside.,2
Good morning good morning the coffee was old the place is dirty I will not come back here again the people are nice but the place is dirty very dirty please clean up paint please cleanest McDonald though the bathroom was dirty the tables were dirty the outside was dirty have a great day,2
There is a theme with drive thru only restaurant's cold food and watered down drinks and if don't check your bags well enough before you drive away and your order is wrong you can't just walk back inside and get it fixed you have get back in line andt all over again! Open up the lobby people,2

"Dirty, slow, inefficient. They now bring your food to your table. They forgot me. So my food was colder than usual.",2
Long line at drive thru,2
Rude employees & there are always beggars.,2
Every vehicle that ordered was told to move into a parking space to wait for their food. Why not just allow everyone to wait at the window if service is so slow. The other thing that set me off is they had a lady in her late 70's bring the food out. She did so with a loving warm smile but I only hope they take care of her when the younger fit employees clock in. No offense she was a sweet heart just worried.,2
"It's 6:15pm, line is SUPER LONG!! Waited a quite of bit of time just to order. So be prepared!!

6yyyyy,2
Poor ,2
Could only order from kiosk. Wanted some extras but serving staff struggled with English,2
I personally don't like fast food but McDonald's is a mainstay. NYC has much more to offer than that as a food choice.,2
Wendys is better but this place satisfies the munchies. Watch out for the dopeheads and crack fiends looking to score!,2
Worst MC ever.,2
The employees were very rude and very unpleasant. Need better people skills. And better staff,2
Too many homeless hang out in front of here. A lot of them are violent. No drink refills here because people would take cups out of the trash and steal soda.,2
Poor ,2
We went through the drive-through and ordered 2 bacon-cheese burgers and 2 big Mac's and we asked for them to leave the middle part (the bread in the center). We got the bacon-cheese burgers and they were fine. But the big Mac's not only still had the bread in the center but had another piece of bread on the bottom with mac-sause on them. So instead of 2 pieces of meat and 2 pieces of bread I ended with 2 pieces of meat and 4 pieces of bread. I was not amused when I got home. You can bet that I will NOT EVER stop there again.,2
"This McDonald's has horrible service for the morning breakfast they will make you late for work.
Their morning management and workers need much more improvement, they make you wait as long as 15 minutes to receive your order.

Workers are loud in kitchen playing around...not professional. Not coming back here,2

So slow for fast food. Half hour in the drive threw.,2
It was clean and we order from the touch screen  menu.  The place was small and not crowded.  ...,2

Very dirty and bathrooms were closed. Standard MD food otherwise.,2
It's realy bad when the register personnel cant count change that is done by the computer infront of there face.,2
They're supposed to serve breakfast until 11am but they stop WAY before that.  Not cool.,2
Drive Through. Did not give me ketchup for my fries.,2
Very slooowww service. Just about any time I show. They send you to the waiting spot # 2 for 10 minutes for 2 chicken nuggets happy meals and 2 chicken sandwich. This happens often. I will go to a different McDonald's.,2
Poor ,2
Ok,2
"Slow employees, not being really kind, to many uber eats before you, not too much attention on the place being clean.",2
Service was fine but why cold burgers and worse again cold fries?,2
"My experience was ok. They forgot little things in my order, like a straw for iced tea, and cream and sugar that i requested.  The wifi is not available like they stated, when searching for wifi there is no ""mcdonals wifi"" instead it was a wired name like EBOS. The connection did not allow for simple web browsing.  For a Mcdonalds thats near universal studios. This place is ok.",2
"A different McDonald's experience worth trying. We had a good time trying different menu items not found at any other McDonald's. Definitely worth a visit if you're coming to Orlando.

Update: Not the same as it used to be. The selections are limited and not as international as it once was. It lost it's uniqueness and it feels like it's just a regular busy McDonald's now. Not recommended anymore.",2
"Drive thru was slow
...",2
Not good for health as we all know but a little good food,2
Couldn't eat there as they don't have Halal menu,2
Order a chocolate chip frape and after a15 minute wait they told me they didn't have any,2
Asked me to leave saying my dog was not allowed on their outdoor patio,2
Very slow for late night. No communication with staff for efficiency. At least one of the employees at register is willing to admit fault for delayed food,2
8I of o,2
Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this McD. I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service. I am not sure if it's because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying. Never has my sauce order been correct. Never. Even when I pay for it. Even when I ask and confirm at the window. It's awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the bag.,2
Went at night at the request of my son since we had a very long day of driving. Bad move on our part. Ordered a filet. It was totally hard. Not just the bread. The fish was a hockey puck. Very nasty. Had to throw it out. The fries were the back up....thank goodness for those at least!  We also waited too long on line but his nuggets and fries were okay.,2
The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice. When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it. I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok. She then gave me a 10 piece nugget instead of 6 I don't know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold. I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed. Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully.  Usually go to this location at least 4 times but will NEVER return and encourage any one I know to skip this location,2
"Small, crowded with inefficient system with limited seating. Messed up a simple order. Had to wait to get napkins and ketchup since it's at front counter only.",2
"Everytime we go through the drive through here something gets missed.  The caramel flavoring is missing from my latte today. Fruit Fly is the OJ. No syrup in the sprite. Missing order items. There is always something.
I realize it's a busy place but some attention to detail is needed.",2
"They always get my order wrong, either they don't give me something ,or they give me the wrong thing.",2
Poor ,2
"Good evening. Completely disorganized staff speaking very loudly in Haitian Creole
The wait was very long.",2
"Hispanic young skinny girl, Shes at the cash register and her attitude stinks ",2
I give 2 out of five because the ice cream machine wasn't broken twice out of the last five times I came to get ice cream.,2
Staffs were friendly. Lunch time gets crowded and might make mistakes in your order.,2
Come on... It's McDonald's,2
Poor ,2
The service was awful and rude. They messed up my order when trying to get it fixed the manager had and attitude even though I had my receipt to show I wasnt lieing.,2
There is a theme with drive thru only restaurant's cold food and watered down drinks and if don't check your bags well enough before you drive away and your order is wrong you can't just walk back inside and get it fixed you have get back in line andt all over again! Open up the lobby people,2
"Line for drive-thru was slow, and when we got up to order, literally a third of the menu said that it was not in stock. ""Be back soon"". We ended up not ordering.",2
The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice. When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it. I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok. She then gave me a 10 piece nugget instead of 6 I don't know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold.

Poor ,2
"They messed my order up 2 times. They remade my sandwich and the chicken was still raw. They have nasty attitudes. You have to use the kiosk to place your order. There is no more service with a smile. An update I now have food poisoning form the raw/ undercooked chicken I was served yesterday. Don't eat here, I will never come back here ever again. My reviews have been see by over 100,500 people.",2
The place was Filthy and the Seats are All Badly Torn. This McDonald's is a DUMP... FIX IT UP...,2
"Went to order drive-thru and not sure if it was the person was training or technical difficulties, but the person who was taking the order could not understand or hear us. After repeating ourselves several times, Im guessing a manager took over but she had the NASTIEST attitude over the speakerphone. I was clear on my order but Im guessing the workplace mustve been stressful for her to had taken my order the way she did. Its McDonald",2
This is one of the worst McD's around. I've only been there twice in maybe a year but both experiences were far less than stellar. Forters the smell coming thru the window was awful. On today's visit  apparently the person in front of me claimed my order and the cashier didn't handle it well. She kept yelling to the front that the lady paid for the wrong order ($3 less- like she didn't notice) and it took her about 5 min to straighten it all out. Skip this one and move on to the next one down the road.,2
The Atmosphere must change ! Too much homelessness!,2
"Sorry what i have to said,but this place always is a mess. Everytime you going to this restaurant have to wait a lot for your food,just because the employes always been around they place of work talk like they are on the street,in ocasion i hear said bad word when the costumer been inside the store,honestly they need better cordination at the time of work.",2
"Predictable. Mediocre food. Arrogant manager. Incompetent staff. They dropped part of my order, did not charge me for it, and woukd not restore it. And got sauces wrong.",2
"Had a crispy chicken sandwich which was ok, small case and fries which resembled a form of spaghetti. I should of gone to Chick-fil-A.",2
"Looked like it could have done with some more staff.

Dude handing out the food just marked random ones as gone even though he didn't announce the numbers.

We had to go ask for ours. It was just chilling there.

But it's McDonald's. If you're going, you're going to go regardless of the rating.",2
It's not what it used to be. There longer waits in line and the service isn't really all that great. They're sometimes understaffed because that people are overworked or not paid enough. However it does serve the local community and passerbuys. So it is good for something.,2
"Computers were not working, cash only a complete mess. Cashiers do not know how to operate without them.",2
"Mc Donald's needs to give its name a goooooo. This was terrible and dry. The food was room temperature.  I have burgers, fish sandwiches, chicken sandwiches fries and drinks . It was all terrible!",2
They are not 24hrs them doors are locked after 10pm & open at 630AM & Breakfast Ends at 10AM they just backwards,2
The lobby guy is friendly but coughing by people who are eating. Staff were not friendly about no longer being able to take verbal orders and only using the kiosk.,2
"No Refills!  It took about 10 minutes for me and everyone else in line to get their order done. They could only give you 3 ranch for 20 Chicken Nuggets, not even 4. Fo",2
No vegeterian options,2
Poor ,2
"Check orders! Sauces are not included.
Long time to cook",2
Ive had one really positive experience at this McDonalds and one really negative. First time they were super fa,2
Poor ,2
"Forgets food often, longer wait time than some coasters in town. Ran out of diet coke.",2
"They were cleaning surfaces while simultaneously serving food off them- and i dont mean they were drying, there was water sloshing. And bizarrely, my 10 piece mcnugget order was ready and bagged up on the counter before I even paid. I ordered at a kiosk, so no one overheard my order and acted fast... I got to the train station a block away and opened my food to find that my food was soggy and slightly brownish. Dont eat here at night.",2
I like going to McDonald's for their coffee drinks and the dollar drinks. I don't eat there.,2
I do not like the food,2
Poor ,2
"The women bathroom doors didn't close,  and they were for dirty . There were long lines to order food that was unorganized and crowded.",2
Young people do not care very much about customer service.,2
This mornig was close.,2
Poor response from delivery counter,2
"Legit almost just got robbed here would not suggest going at night, even if your with the homies",2
This is not the worlds biggest McDonald,2
Not because of the staff or food. Because it's understaffed. Too long a wait in lobby and drive thru.,2
"Below-average Mcces, especially in terms of cleanliness, but also the friendliness of the staff. You know that from Germany much more professional, cleaner and above all friendlier. I like McDonald's, but we won't be going back here. What was good: there was enough space and on the upper floor you can also look",2
Breakfast is ok,2
Typical Mickey D food. Lots of homeless people. I wouldn't want my kids exposed to that.,2
"The only reason that I stoped to buy at McDonald's was because of my youngest daughter. But what we experienced today put an end to it. The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving  customers in the drive thru area. As you noticed, there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case. The associate, instead of been polite, talked to us in a not too pleasant tone. I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up. Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the experience. I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant experience.",2
"Got order wrong.  Grunt a ""here ya go"".",2
Bathroom smells like an exhibit at the zoo,2
No surprises here.  It's McDonald's.,2
"Food cold and forgot items, food was replaced so only 2 I'm afraid",2
Long lines but pretty fast service,2
"""Fast"" does not seem to be part of their vocabulary. I don't know if they changed management or what but they screw up orders, drive thru is slow & most of their employees are rude. It wasn't like this in the past.",2
"Frequently at this location, someone is spewing toxic gases into the air, violating local laws (& humane rights; despite a security guard on site).
Cashiers are expected to be able to actually perform elementary subtraction, such as 12-7=5; (because the US doesn't mint 3 dollar bills) and I already have enough singles to stuff Magic Mike's g-string.
If this location has take out hours & dining room hours, that should be posted; on entry ways & online. Otherwise, we patrons expect to sit down, not be told the seating area is closed 30 minutes prior to closing and 20+ minutes after opening. MGMT should schedule site & employee hours accordingly.",2
Sad to say the only thing good r the workers..who work hard I only come for coffe ..but they serve u with a smile ..saddest part that this location. Is filled with homeless people ..more homeless then customers. .sorry to say...will I come bk yes cause I enjoy the coffee befir church ....,2
"Went through the drive through and had poor customer service. It was late at night (10pm) though, so I understand. Also the wait was 15+ minutes for my order while others were churning through. Lesson learned: chicken tenders take time.",2
"the slowest mc Donalds in the world!  It is supposed to be 24 hours, but they leave it closed to customers and by car mac it takes 15 minutes per customer.  I mean I wasted 1h of my life waiting for such a bad and slow service",2
Poor ,2
"Unsafe experience.
Lots of homeless people inside and out.A few even smoking weed.
Place was too dirty.",2
Food is always wrong,2
McDonald's is a place where it's hard to get what I want the way I want it without having to wait extra time. The problem is that they put onions on everything.,2
"It was ok , cheep on handling out ketchup and I asked for mayonnaise ,, they said they didn",2
"Went through drive thru, ordered a quarter pounder meal with out cheese . Was told only had can drinks. Ok, asked for a diet soda, I was told that they only have can drinks and water. Ok, so I said water. Then after I got my receipt and proceeded to next window, I  looked at the receipt , and I was upcharged $.39 for the water. What the heck? So I asked the employee at the window, wht was I uocharged .39 cents for the water. She said "" I don't know, that's all we got"". I  understand that the soda machines are down, but to offer can drinks and water, but uocharge, and not told why, or an employee to make the effort to explain, or even care. Terrible customer service. Disappointed.",2
I came in at 10:30 on a Sunday and no dam breakfast.really? The only thing I want at 10:30 in the morning on a Sunday is an egg mc muffin. They had no pancakes. I only drink coffee and have breakfast at McDonald's and they didn't have acceptable breakfast products.,2
Restaurant is aged.  Chairs mostly torn.  Ice Tea is as sweet as syrup.,2
"Dirty restroom, old oil fries",2
So so sorry I couldn't get over the managers attitude,2
"No electrical outlets for customers in a fairly large restaurant. They also got my order wrong--I ordered an egg and cheese biscuit and got chicken, which at least is more expensive than what I ordered even if it wasn't what I wanted. Hash browns overpriced. They make it look like you get two on the kiosk graphic to trick you.",2
Service are not good,2
"I ordered hot chocolate on machine and when I went to the pickup they told me it was sold out...
And the floor is really dirty. Clearly this restaurant is out of management.",2
Poor ,2
"The service is horrible, they want to take the order however they want",2
"This is place is always crowded with homeless ppl and their belongings. The clerk taking your order is always impatient as if they have something way better to do than assist you, and to top it off the dining hours end at 5pm so if you're not driving through drive thru, tough luck.. save your money and go to another local McDonald's or the Farmer Boys less than a block away.",2
ORDERED 3 items only got 2,2
You would find the Covid-19 vaccine here before you found a working ice cream machine,2
"I expect crowding because it's close to the beach. The ice machine is always out, they don't have enough fresh brewed tea to refill the container, and some of the employees have attitude. The security guard tends to trip, but it's not always the same guard. Service is pretty fast considering the volume of customers. I only go there because of proximity.",2
"I went at 11 a.m at tooks almost 25 minutes to get mi meal. Very poor attention.
Second time (2022) I went to this Mac and the situation is the same that 4 years ago... I think is't worst... very dirty, disorder everywhere, completelly full, bad mood in general. That morning took me 45 minutes to get my breakfast. I promise, will never come back.",2
Poor ,2
"This manager tru me out.
Siad a was not welcome n his store just cus o told they need open at 5 am",2
One of the worst with service. I ordered a ice latte through the app for pickup. So I go inside I wait at pickup. Drink isnt ready and other people are waiting also. I mentioned to the solo employee I had a pickup order. She says ok then goes off to make other peoples meals. So I try to be patient stood there for like 20min and never received my drink. They never canceled my drink I left and was still charged for it. Also they never sent the 1 cashier who was struggling by herself no help.,2
Poor ,2
Customer service is less than impressive. Food quality was average. Longer than normal wait for basic food order.,2
Doesn't open 24hrs. Tables gotta get cleaned but employees just spend time chatting,2
Lack of customer service. I wish McDonald's will invest in improving their hospitality more than  spending alot of money in advertising .,2
"Not a very pleasant McDonald's to visit.
#1 the area for the lines is small. So expect to be cramped when it's busy, and be confused as to where the lines are, and where theyt.
#2 the employees are not friendly, I wouldn't say they're mean, but they obviously don't care about any pleasantries, or seem to care about you.
#3 there is no where in the store an area where you can grab napkins, or ketchup, or straws. You have to go up to the counter and ask them for packets and straws and utensils, during lunch time when lines are longer and it's getting congested at the counter, it makes it worse when people have to constantly come up to the counter and ask for something.

I don't recommend coming here if you want to stop and relax for food.",2
"Really nice McDonalds but the waiting is horrible, no one is taken the in house orders, only drive thru is being taken care of, I've been standing here for 27 minutes until I got to put in my order, not a word said to me about the wait, only 3 of the 8 desserts have labels. Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the chicken. After receiving my order McDonald's employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch screen, One customer said she didn't know how to use it so she was told by the McDonald's employee to continue to wait. I finally got my order after 39 minutes after coming in through the door.",2
Jet,2
Employee at the first window was very helpful and he made sure my order was right however the girl at the second one ignored me and looked confused. The muffin sandwich bread was stale and very tough and the hash browns were cold and also tasted like they sat on a shelf for way too long. After 2 bites I threw it in the trash and purchased a sandwich from a near by gas station much better food). I'm from out of town and on my way to a meeting so returning wasn't an option.,2
"Overall looks like it's falling apart. Ice cream machine broken half the time, mcflurry machine couldn't mix in the Oreos, roof is leaking...",2
Always a long wait today it took 35 min in drive through most times around 15 min but like their ice tea so but up with it,2
People are usually drunk here and the service people really dont like their jobs.,2
"Under construction, best to avoid until it is finished.",2
Always they make a mistake,2
Poor ,2
Awful place. Really. Bad service and everything is dirty and stinks,2
Food the same service to slow,2
Not the best one I have been in. Time in line was long and food was wrong. Disgusting bathroom,2
Milkshake never works main reason I go there shamrock shakes never have it,2
The service was slow,2
"They had No Filet Fish today,that what I came there for",2
Very stringent on providing Ketchup. Last 3-5 visits Ive been given only 1,2
Usually busy but they get you through there pretty fast. Watch out for the homeless people this McDonald,2
"McDonald's is fast food not because it's good but a quick cup of coffee ok.
Don't expect much as far as food! The
worst thing really is the ordering and waiting to get what you ordered!! Worse McDonald's is 8th Ave 35st! Very bad staff! I asked for a straw I had dropped mine no no no I said I'll pay for it never got the straw lol! You will live eating the food get ready for
cold food! And nevermind an extra anything! Shame it was not bad but now",2
Get a veggie burger already!! God!!!,2
Always great to go there but they need to work on giving food or right to there customers several cases of not handing me the right stuff,2
Poor ,2
Always slow service from how it takes before someone takes your order to when you food comes out.,2
The people working here are not friendly.  Went through the drive through and the only only thing said to me was my total.,2
Worst food ever. The hamburgers taste like a paper.,2
Sloooooow service! 1:00 PM and just got a cheeseburger & small fries from drive-thru because I was late for a meeting. Took 15 minutes for this simple order!! Really...for a burger & fries?,2
"Service was all great but it was dirty all over, it had a very foul odor",2
Service and food quality are inconsistent,2
This is the slowest McDonald's I've ever experienced.  The staff is difficult to deal with and 5 out of 5 times our order is wrong. Great location and clean facilities though.,2
"didnt give it 1 because the food was good but around 4 days ago, i went at night through the drive thru and I gave my McDonald's app code to get the points, i ordered something that was 15 dollars in total and they charged me 31 dollars and the reason for this was that the guy that was taking care of the drive thru applied my McDonald's app code to another car order( my card is linked to the app ) and I ended up paying for their food, i know this because they guy asked my name and when I told him he said something to the manager and I said, yeah I think that car  is using my code , the guy just said "" is your lucky day go to the next window ""  It was late at night so I didn't give it much thought because I didn't know just by giving your code you can get charged  but next day I got surprised when my account got charged twice. Tried calling but they didn't solve my issue this is why I am leaving a review",2
same as always,2
Poor ,2
Fries not fresh and sandwich was weirdly falling apart. Consistently not a great experience at this drive thru.,2
Fastfood,2
"Horrible! Got home ordered a crispy chicken sandwich. They gave it to me on a plain dry bun, with nothing on it. Just chicken & bread.",2
If you can handle the homeless people attacking you then it's awesome.,2
"Bad attitude, very rude to customer.",2
Poor ,2
"They forgot my apple slices, but still charged me. we literally only ordered 8 hashbrowns 3 soft drinks and my apples... it was not a hard order at all. And I didn't notice till we got back to our hotel, because you know you can't eat indoors or even outside.",2
"Not only am I not a big fan of fast food joints but I'm absolutely opposed to filth in any restaurant.
And filth is what I experienced at this McDonald's.
The staff who waited on us was nice, accommodating, and quick, and the food adequate; but the restaurant itself had empty sugar and creamer packs laying everywhere. Reason being, there as no place to throw them away.
So, I am advising you to avoid this McDonald's!",2
"You know those moments when you're looking for a way to kill massive amounts time? Visit this place. Seriously, one visit and you'll understand.",2
I wanted to get a McFlurry. Unfortunately it was out of stock.,2
"I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries. I even heard them making comments about the free coupon. Also the women at the window seem to be fooling around too much hence the extremely long line during lunch and dinner times. I stopped by 4 times in one week and had an issue each time.

The young white guy at the first window is really nice though hence the 2 instead of 1",2
It's ok if in hurry for food for supper,2
"This McDonalds restaurant was Ok. Neither more or less compared to my expectations. However, I find it on a negative side note the constant stream of homeless people entering the restaurant, causing somewhat of a commotion.

The service and the employees of the restaurant was helpful and fine.",2
Ok food service 0 and prices difference from all other,2
"As has been for the last year slow, slow service. Went inside this time, no better.",2
Sat in drive thru for very long time to be told no fountain drinks no frappes no coffee and food was meh,2
One of the girls was rude was standing there by cash register for 3 minutes before she said go to the kiosk machine I asked why I couldn't order there she said it's not my drawer in a rude way,2
The staff on the drive thru don't have patience.,2
"Dirty, unkind, too long waiting time, too high work load with minimum of employees",2
"I don't like it very much, the breads are not like the ones we used to eat at McDonald's, also almost all of them only speak English and sometimes it's hard to communicate",2
"For kids its probably nice but adults running through or driving through for a quick bite you have to basically explain what you want on your burger. Ordered 2 mcdoubles with cheese and 2 small fries and they were so dry they were kinda crunchy without cheese or even fully cooked. Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat. And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger, and sadly Ited with the fries. And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt. Never going back. Would rather go to checkers across the street.",2
Why did you give me all the wrong orders?,2
the wait is long and the cashiers are rude,2
Terrible service!,2
Got my small order wrong ,2
If your in hurry i guess,2
30 minutes in the drive through... again.,2
Poor quality food was served day visited,2
Slow service. Wrong order,2
The Google info says open 24 hours. It's not. Pulled up at 530am and just sat to use wifi. After a little while the morning crew came in and out up cones on all the parking spots near me. It was very strange.,2
They can't get the right order most of the time,2
"The food was not hot, plus staff  need to talk to customers  better .",2
Well i order a crispy chicken sandwich small fry and a coke. Normally I look in the bag this time I just reached in for a fry. When I get home I find 10 piece nugget two BBQ sauces and a double cheese burger. I was to far to go back so I ate 5 nuggets and half the burger. Check your food people I was very disappointed but my dogs were thrilled.,2
Don't purchas the nuggets after 11pm cold hard and overall just not good,2
The food was dry and cold,2
Poor ,2
"The times have gone there they are always super backed up, I try to add something at the window I'm paying and they tell me to go around and go through a big line for a single item after waiting for like 30 mintues. Also when I ask for a frappe they tell me they are not selling them right now just because they don't want to deal with more people waiting. They need to get more people to work of they don't like to keep people waiting.",2
The managers have an attitude for no reason.  Haven't been there for long time.,2
"Yeah, the food here is gross. First and last time here. The nuggets were brown--not golden brown, BROWN. The parfaits looked really unappealing. I'm thinking they were frozen and then sat in the sun and baked and then were put back in the fridge. Gross.

They had me park to wait for my order. I stepped outside of my car to make a bottle for my baby. The drive thru worker stuck her head out the window and yelled, ""Your parfaits are ready!""

 Do you have feet? You want me to walk",2
Poor ,2
"To slow in the morning,",2
The only thing worse than the service was the food. My wife's Big Mac tasted like it had been dropped in an ashtray.,2
Poor ,2
Prefer other locations. Always security inside here and constant shady business going down outside.,2
Poor ,2
Noisy,2
"Largest and slowest in the world. Took 25 minutes from when I drove up till I left. Took 15 minutes to get my food after I paid. Also I did not get a ""good morning""or anything except 739. The cost of my food. Extremely bad service and attitudes from everyone I encountered there. All for 2 sausage biscuits and a coffee.",2
New look is Dark Unfriendly and less seating - finding a new Bright family friendly MCDONALD'S,2
Really long SLOW line at the drive through. Took FOREVER.,2
Poor ,2
I don't like it very much because whenever you order something they measure what it is not...,2
That  place is expensive $3.00+ for large iced coffee.  I'd rather go to 7-11 store,2
"They charge more there than my local Mc D,in Windgap... 60 cents more for a large Mocha Frappie in Brodheadsville, never again",2
"Drive thru takes forever and orders are never right, the inside with the new send order plus counter orders it's mobbed and confusing",2
"Food was the bog standard, biggest issues here are:
1. The cheeseburger I ordered had a hard bun.
2. Service was terribe there should be lines or devides to clearly mark queing lanes rather than someone shouting ""There are three lines"" and there be nobody serving in the other 2.
3. They messed up my order (seems to be the case in every McDonald's in NYC they seem to miss out 2 of the things on my order, that being fries or drink.)
Wouldn't recomend.",2
By far one of the dirtiest McDonald's I've ever been to. 10 dirty tables the entire time we were there. No hand sanitizer...,2
Poor ,2
"Slow service even on take out, didn't get everything I ordered and the food was below par. Go to subway just down the street.",2
"This morning 10/11/2022, went through the drive thru for my breakfast.  Two things medium Hot mocha plain and sausage mcmuffin. Paid and advanced to the next window.  Here is where things went wrong!
The blue shirt manager  ( last name begin with an A) on duty Had a serious attitude.  She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong order. She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my order. I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee . She said the there is no coffee on the order. I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to me. Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE CUP.  Which is her job .
Her Words loud and clear
""FOR GOD SAKE""
I know I only spent a few dollars but IT don't justify getting attitude because this is your job.
I ask for a refund..",2
I work around the corner from this particular location. My coworkers were all excited to see the newly renovated location. I usually don't get fast food but I really wanted a milkshake before work. How do you redo the entire building but you still don't have any milkshakes?! I should've taken the extra drive and gone to Chick fil A.,2
"I hate it when I point out a problem and the management tell me that that's the way its supposed to be.  I managed a McDonald's for many years.  I know better. I still order their food regularly all over the country.  I know better. The new manager has made things much better, but standards still slip back to the old ways when he's not here.",2
"Consistently bad as we
Have become conditioned to expect and except.",2
"It's a McDonald's so the food is very consistent. Unfortunately, the parking lot is impossible to use since the drive through wraps through it. I've been stuck in the parking lot for 20 minutes with no way to get out.",2
"It was dirty, homeless people hanging out inside asking for money,I offered a person $5 to buy a meal and was insulted,I guess money was for Drugs or beer",2
"Full of homeless people, there were no napkins, this was the worst mcdonalds I've ever been.",2
"I only come here late at night.  Staff do okay, they seem pretty busy with drive through or other tasks.  The dining room stays dirty for a long time while the cashiers are helping out behind the line even if there are only a few customers.",2
We had breakfast here a couple of times. Always tons of homeless people around. One guys was dancing like crazy. Pretty entertaining ...,2
Nice place clean but got 2.. Always during lunch it gets packed and they have a way to order your food yourself now me being me I would help out bit when it's always asked in a rude way to order your meal back there I cannot accept. They need more help there obviously.. Sorry McDonalds but needs to change there tactics on time management and other stuff aside from that a gentleman behind me did not get to order because he didnt place his order by himself but neither did i.. No bueno.,2
Just tried to order and debit card machine not working!  Second time it's happened here in two weeks.  Really?? Poor management.,2
"Not Satisfied, after buying 3 Large orders of fries for $11.97 and was given large containers SERIOUSLY HALF FULL looking like Small or Medium sized fries. Very disappointed...",2
Drove thru wrong item given,2
They are fast but they almost always screw up your order!,2
Poor ,2
"The tomato on the hamburger tasted FUNKY tonight, really gross. And chicken nuggets were stale and cold.",2
Usually always good but today was a lil different. My girlfriend went thru the drive thru and ordered a 40 piece nuggets and only got a 4 piece. They never read back the order like the people alway did before. So there was no way to correct the mistake. Plus they didn,2
Warm drink cold food,2
"Fries- soggy most of the time
Soda- gets bad constantly (Gave me seltzer water instead of soda)
Sandwiches- not bad except that theyre dry sometimes.
Customer service- anything else? After every single request instead of would you care to try our new ___?",2
Bad service never coming back here drivetrhu.super slow.,2
"I ordered a fish burger and it only brings the bread, the fish and mayonnaise. I expected it to bring lettuce and tomato but no, I think it would be better with luchuga and tomato",2
"High volume drive thru, with heavy wait time. This McDonald's can't handle amount of people that here. If you want to wait a long time for the meal. Then you came to the right palce",2
Service was awful,2
then the worst burger here in the US,2
"IT is ALLWAYS hotter than any other ""arch"" we've ever visited IN & Surrounding town's!",2
Cold fries. Property full of bums. One even got aggressive toward me and asked for my French fries.,2
Rude.,2
There is a young and very heavy set woman working the register that seemed to have slept through customer service training.,2
Poor ,2
Seriously the slowest mcd I've ever been to.,2
"Not very clean, but true to McDonalds",2
"Not a good McDonald's location. No free refills.
Good was not very good compared to other locations.",2
Too bad I only bought two coffees and it took me more than 19 minutes and they still moved me to the parking lot and then I had to return because they didn't take what I bought with them lousy service,2
Wait for my order over 10 minutes drive thru#2 Deluxe with extra onions. Fries where soggy. Had to go back inside to get fresh fries. Looked under staffed,2
They got a simple order completely wrong.,2
They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night shift. This location seems to be very popular at night and yet the management has barely anyone back there making orders. There was a giant mob waiting at the register's for their orders. Be smarter with your manning.,2
"My order was wrong, the staff is young impatient, unprofessional, to say the least. Don't eat here.",2
Awesome. Love the fresh burger,2
Poor ,2
"All self ordering machines... food took forever to come out, drink machine didn't work",2
The brief interaction with the cashier was almost non existent. The large order of fries was more of a small order of fries.,2
This mcdonald is horrible. Bad costumer service through drive thrue . i do not recommend this mcdonald to anyone . I hate this mcdonald and will always hate it . Kay  .kay,2
The lady didn't do my order correctly an she got upset when I asked for the correct items,2
"I'm from a foreign place and I just happened to stop in this McDonalds for a quick bite. These are the things I noticed. #1. Active on site security inside the establishment. I felt like I was being scrutinized. I assume shady things go on here. #2. I found out this McDonalds is located in an area called skid row. #3. The price of the food here is above the average price of the rest of the united states of america. #4. There isn't really a lot of friendly interaction between the clerk and the guest as well. For the most part this is what I gathered from this place. Taking into account that it was the first and only time I've been there. Not a good representation for Los Angeles for it being so close to the Greyhound bus station portal. If its any consolation , I received my food hot and it was good.",2
"Massive homelessness dirty outside.
No parking NO drive thru security more worried about masks then the drugs dealing at the door.",2
t's fast food they take like 20-30 for an order and all the tables are dirty,2
Wrong order through the drive thru. Doesnt surprise me any more with this location. Glad I'm not allergic to the items I requested to be removed.,2

"I've been going to this location most of my life since it's not far from my home. So I've seen this McDonald's go through a lot of changes. The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a ""sitting"" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness.",2
Poor ,2
"They need more happy people in there and people to actually Acknowledge there guest and smile.  It's horrible to feel like your a bother as a customer when your spending your hard earned working money at your restaurant.  NOT GOOD for the business at all, especially when your a regular.  This needs attention Immediately to earn the people's business.",2
"There worse ! Wet lettuce  or dead.
Fries or nasty burnt dried up 5.00 Sunday Sept 25.  Made attempt  to call management  but kept  hanging  up there phone. This restaurant  needs to shut down.",2
Manager called me out for seating and eating my food at 11pm. There were some seats available. Closes at 2am. If they don't want folks to sit they need to robe off all seats. Manager allowed me to eat.,2
SLOW SLOW SLOW and the younger people there are so RUDE!!! New renovation but same slow workers and RUDENESS ...this past Saturday waited 15 min in drive thru and never placed an order we as many as 10 cars backed out and left,2
The food was at McDonald's standards. But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than average. Garbage cans overflowing. Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser wasn't draining. Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste catcher. You couldn't even set your cups down to fill them up.,2
Much. They always get my order wrong.,2
"I didn""t get order how dose it work",2
I got 3 sloppy vanilla ice cream cones today.,2
There was a homeless guy in the restaurant that was being very vulgar.  It did not make for a pleasant meal.  The apple pies here are great.,2
FOOD ALWAYS COLD ,2
"Wow this is just a scary place , lots of unwell homeless people.  Unkept dirty place. Garbage bins overflowing.",2
"Every, time, I, come, here... EVERY TIME!! I don't think I've been able to ever successfully pick up an order from here.. like ever. They either don't have the order, or my pickup gets cancelled because of the wait time... Smh",2
It was dirty there were fly's and they got my order wrong. When I asked to get my right items they acted like I Was wasting their time. I switched to J n B now.,2
The McDonald's I just went to was so filthy I didn't even eat there. The parking lot was disgusting all around the outside of the building was really filthy. Inside was better but not by that much.,2

Avoid this McDonald's. Terrible service, incorrect bill charges. Just a bad experience.",2
"Fries had a soft old feel, nuggets not crispy, chicken burger was brownish and stale, this was 2am but others on this island at this time are way more fresher. So nahhhh",2
"Manages to allow something to screw up anything Everytime! I came here for 6 days in total. Normally I do not eat at McDonald's but this place is very close to where I'm staying.

They have new electronic ordering system using touchpad on giant vertical screen. Still gets my order wrong 80 percent of time... What? Asks me what drink I want. Then I just get the cup so why ask me? One day, I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom. Locator and food is gone. Takes me a while to get it sorted out.forgets my drink {again)

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure. Gets little sauce on my clothes, not too bad but Jesus Christ... One night, lot of drinks do not work except for coke (yuk)  few other things not worth mentioning. They get swamped a lot nad hardly can keep up.

Otherwise place is relatively new looking as well as private bathroom with your own stall and sink. Clean.",2

Bad food but OK service.,2
Not great food,2

"Its been awhile since I last  eat at McDonald's  and so I thought I'd  go in and have a Big Mac, when I ordered  she repeated  one Big Mac, 40 minutes  later they called  my number  it wasn't  a Big  Mac,  it was a crispy chicken, so the manager came and recognized the  problem  then went  away ,the cashier told me  if I want my money back I would have to  get back in that first line. So now I'm  kinda  hot,  then about  3 minutes  later the manager was waving a bag from the  counter at me , so I walk up  and she said  heres your Big Mac sir, let me tell you  that was the tastiest  Big Mac I've had in  years!",2
"The morning manager is rude @ the Roosevelt & Central location in Chicago.  I don't want her to lose her job, just fix her attitude & smile more!!!  I wait a little too long sometimes.",2
"Food and service were fine, but it has no restrooms, really? 50% of why I went in was to use the restroom",2
To long to make customer orders,2
Always having to wait more the 10 to 15 mins in the drive thru.,2
Super slow to get food.  It appears drive thru got all the attention.  15 minutes to get food is too long.  Also when I order a breakfast meal with a soda I want the choice to get a larger drink when they are all the same price,2
Slowest McDonalds in the world and cold french fries,2

Service was slow fries was cold,2
Coffee is average and to sweet,2

This place so deserted  Im.wondering if people really come to buy food,2
We really can't understand how hard it can be to complete our order. Every single time we go they make multiple mistakes n it's so frustrating.,2
"Sooo slow, and got my order completely wrong. Didn't seem to care.",2
No outlets and to crowded,2
"Every time I came during my two week visit I was asked to pull forward into the parking spots where the mobile ordering area is, there was always 2-4  cars pulled up waiting for food just so they can make their drive thru times better. No one wants to pull forward for you to make your ratings look better. Get it together ",2
The fries are the best. Please bring back the Hi-c!,2
Some workers are so anger and do not attend in a good way,2
Tbh every McDonald's in the city feels like a portal to hell,2
Don't eat here it's bad for you.,2
"Mickey D""s is just what it is ...",2
Too much waiting seems like the staffs don't know how a fast food restaurant suppose to be run. On top of the wait they forget items that you pay for so make sure to ask for a receipt if something not right with this McDonalds please report it call and complain.,2
It was ok but they didn't bag my happy meals and my nuggets and and no drink holder 3 drinks and a shke so it all feel out in the car and the shake stained my seats but ##it happens right,2
"Slow service and attendents don't acknowledge customers....I ate there multiple times since it was close to where I was saying and could get a quick bite to eat, but it was slow",2
"Ive never reviewed a fast food restaurant before because my expectations are never too high anyway. Fathers Day, drive thru at noon we were seriously in line for 25 mins. This one has two separate planes to order) The order taker was very slow coming to the speaker for all the vehicles, when paying we were barely acknowledged, but the worse was to come. When at the next window to get our food.. the person did not even look at me.. literally just handed a bag out the window, then handed the drink out the same way..partially angled down towards me. Better yet, check out the new crispy chicken deluxe. ",2

"Our order was incorrect. We ordered a Big Mac meal - with a large coke and a medium caramel frappe. We were handed a medium coke with the meal and frappe. When we said the coke was supposed to be large, the worker (Manager) asked for the receipt, which shows:
1 Big Mac Ml-Lrg
1 M Coke
Then she said: You have to ask for a large- We did!! She didn't offer to correct their error.
When do you ever order a large meal with a medium drink????? The fry was a large, but they were cold. The Big Mac was dry. I forgot why we don't usually go to McDonald's. Thank you for reminding me.",2
"I think I had much higher expectations of this McDonald's because I was strongly suggested to visit.  I expected a 30 foot statue of Ronald McDonald and it ended up being a lackluster 30 foot lighted outline of Ronald on the building.  The picture online of the building made it look like it was made of a French Fry building structure.  It wasn't.  They had a separate drink station where you gave them your drink order (an extra step because no self service ones anywhere).  They had a separate dessert station, and a walk up food counter to order or self-serve kiosks to order from, where they will serve if you eat in (but not the soft drinks).  It is 2 stories.  The 2nd floor is a play area which I expected would be huge (it isn't), and a small arcade area...very small.  The menu showed some items different from other McDonald's but 95% of them showed OUT OF STOCK. So we just ate the kind of food you could eat at a regular McDonald's only it cost MUCH more! All-in-all,very unexciting and not what it should be for being the WORLD'S LARGEST MCDONALD'S! ",2
The security officer made me very uncomfortable. Hered andred. My mom only got a sweet tea.,2
Was great but now they no longer stay open late. Have to go to another one in next town over. Inconvenient..,2
Food wasnt too bad for McDonalds standards. Atmosphere despite a bit messy its interesting since this is the biggest ,2
Very disappointed that there was no indoor seating. Doors were locked. Drive-thru only. Needed to sit at a table and eat. Decided to eat elsewhere.,2

They never get my order right. The service sucks,2

Cleanliness is not a priority,2
The problem is with these Mexican cashiers.When they have s Mexican customer they all know each other.So after they order.They chit chat.Even when it busy..plus they get better customer thsn the Whites do.And that to me is discrmmation,2
coffee was weak and watered down. ,2
Poor service  I had a 20 nugget 2 medium fries a m caramel frappe and medium mocha frappe they charged me for a small mocha and salad dressing she charged me the difference but they almost gave me a small I had to ask why they charged me that also they neglect to let you know they dont have caramel or chocolate and when I asked they just told me there isn't any with attitude,2
"I usually DONT have a problem with McDonald's but tonight was different.  I was ordering something for my granddaughter,  then I wanted something for myself.  I was looking at the menu and the person who was taking my order was very impatient with me,  acting as if I was preventing her from going sometwh.ere.  I said can you give me a minute please,  she replied under her breath ""that's all you had to say in the first place "" then when I went around to pay, she disappeared and had someone else accept my payment.  Then I was handed  my food  withes and nothing Said by the staff. Needless to say,  I threw away the food. Not about to play games with these little high school kids.  A company who cares about their reputation should try to train and manage their workers before hiring them.  Horrible service tonight.",2
This is the slowest McDonald's I've ever experienced.  The staff is difficult to deal with and 5 out of 5 times our order is wrong. Great location and clean facilities though.,2
"Extremely busy when we visited at lunchtime, with queues at most of the automated order points, and hardly anywhere to sit once we had received our food - which was good - from the rather harassed looking staff.

Despite there being a clearly signposted No Loitering policy with a maximum 30 minutes to eat your meal, this did not seem to apply to the rather insalubrious clientele who were occupying most of the seats in the back part of the place. I hesitate to use the word ""restaurant"" to describe this outlet.

As it is almost opposite the Tick Tock Diner, which was really busy at breakfast time, we had planned to try this McDonald's for breakfast, but after today's experience, we'll give it a skip.",2
I always take long. And always mess up on your orders.,2
"This McDonald's has always been bottom-of-the-barrel as far back as I can remember, and a sleek face-lift doesn't change the fact that a visit to this McDonald's will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one, so I'll compile a list:
1. Incorrect orders 50% of the time
2. Rude employees and managers
3. Customers who are loud, offensive, and downright violent
4. Poorly made, slapped-together food

And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company, P.B.S. Parking Boot Service, and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand $200 cash in exchange for the boot removal. It seems this McDonald's is doing everything to lose business. They thrive off of convenient location alone. Absolutely terrible experience.",2
Inconsistent inconsistent that's the truth. Also they don't clean the edges of the booths. Gross,2
Poor ,2
Disappointing for the largest McDonald's. Most menu's items were unavailable when we came in. Service is subpar. Kids had fun in hame rooms.,2
Hash browns are always cold and under-cooked.,2
THE SLOWEST AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Definitely not coming back!,2
this location has 3 floors but usually only 2 are accessible to customers. wouldn't recommend eating here and strongly suggest taking your order to go as the crowds of tourists and locals make it hard to find a seat.,2
"We stopped by for a quick breakfast.  It was not crowded inside, but there was a pretty long drive thru.

Our order was supposed to have 3 food items and 2 drinks. They missed a food item. The lady ignored me when I told her.

My husband went to get it, she finished her task then handed it to him without a word or smile or anything.",2
"Food was hot and order came as it was ordered. However they had no pop. It was okay, would i go back, sure.",2
Soda machine on drive thru window was broken on 12/01/2018 at  around 10:30pm. The person who was taking the order was kind enough to give me the option to go inside with the cup and use the machine inside but his manager told him he could not offer me that option therefore I was unable to buy a soda. Great Management Skills.,2
Didn't get my order correct. No inside seating. I wish I could have tried their sausage gravy and biscuits but I am not taking that to go.,2
They take a long time to give the food.,2
This was a dine in experience. The tables were all dirty & we did not get our food after waiting 35 minutes. Chicken sandwich was burnt.,2
It's not the best like it was 2 years ago but not as bad as it has been in the past.   They have to work out the mobile app ordering. They lose orders plus app says they're out of food.,2
Drive thru service is always slow at this location.  I paid for my order at 645am (and i know because i have my receipt) but i got my food at 703am (and this i know because i had to return a juice at 704am and i have a receipt for that as well)... 20 minutes of wait aside from the extra time i had to wait in line to get to the order speaker and then to the paying window.   the only reason i waited is because i like to leave,2

"A disappointing visit. We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register. We waited over 20 minutes for 3 standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant. The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders. While waiting, we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it. At that point, I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didn't realize it hadn't been served. We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something, whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for. The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything. They did make our order fresh once we asked for it, which is why I gave more that 1 for the food. We would not return to this location.",2
"I ordered 2 of thier ""premium"" chichen sandwiches,  TOTALLY GROSS,  AND SOGGY COLD DOES",2
I got dinner at the drive through tonight and got 2 orders of the bacon cheese fries when I got home and opened them there was a smallest amount of cheese and no bacon at all.. I also got an Oreo McFlurry and was handed it with the lid halfway off and it wasnt mixed.. when I asked if it was gonna her mixed she said not yet than finally took it back and mixed it all while looking very c,2

"Went on a Thursday so it wasn't overwhelmingly busy but still busy enough that there were lines to the kiosks & people wandering to find a cash register employee. Wait time was not bad. Food came in probably 15 mins. We stayed downstairs to receive our trays at the counter, I could see how there would be an issue if you went upstairs to sit & waited for an employee to come find you. The girl who brought our food was very very nice! We received our pastas first even though we ordered the pizza first so I have a feeling it was just sauce pots sitting on warmers to dump quick dishes. Not sure why other comments say their pasta took long. Our pizza came out fine. Really not worth the money but we went for the experience, you get what you get in Orlando... standard happy meal was $8 and pasta meals were $15 for a smallish portion of pasta with a McChicken thrown on top.",2
Its gotten a little better. But i think it might be time to change the managers. And definitely renovate..,2
Not as clean or well organized as most McDonald's.,2
"Was so excited for my first time coming to the big McDonalds  because I was told you could order special menu items. First disappointment. Second, not only were there no numbers to grab once you ordered your food, but we waited over an hour for a ham and cheese French toast, (that we watched sit in the window under a heater that wasnt even working for over 20 mins) a McDouble and Big Mac and a frozen coffee (that was half melted). Very disappointing. Will NEVER go back. The employees were all chi",2
"Checkout took forever.  Only 1 cashier. Didn't  receive my drink cup, had to ask for it, as well as the size, also staffer didn't  give us the milkshake ordered. No sense of Urgency. They need to be more like Chick Filet. I heard several ordered after mine weren't  right. Disappointed.",2
Lost my order while the place was almost empty. Chicken tenders were overcooked.,2

Understaffed.
Too noisy.",2
Typical,2
My family and I get to this McDonald's we are shocked it looked so nice from the outside and they have the jungle themed play house. I ask if they have an outlet so that I may charge my laptop and phone and no. The Wi-Fi here is not even strong enough. I could not complete my homework.  Bummed out.  Not the best as usual.,2

The girl at counter looked at me like I was dumb the entire time I tried to order and seemed like she didnt have a clue how to answer any question I asked. The guy sweeping the lobby was very cordial and actually tried to warn me none of the outlets worked, so kudos to him. Place was clean enough I guess.",2

Really bad service.... Food was cold... And large fries wasn't even full.... Probably size of a medium... Have to do better,2
"Super slow. Trouble getting our order right even after repeating it back twice. Order was right, food that came out wasn't.

Once again with McDonald's, if you must eat here the breakfast burritos are your best bet. And Diet Coke. McDonald's does Diet Coke right.",2
Bummed!!! The girl behind the counter was so helpful. Pretty upsetting that ALL of the sandwiches in my order were wrong. Yay...my fries were right!,2
"Used the delivery to table option. Waited for 30 minutes.  When my food didn't come i walked up to the counter and ot had been sitting in the back for who knows how long. Trash was over flowing, they eventually locked the Mai. Entry door with no sign up to slow down the in coming customers (it was a busy night) I'm pretty sure this was a fire hazard.",2
"Honestly the worst McDonald's, you'd expect more from one by the beach and turns out to be the worst experience.",2
"The people was nice, but they charged me $ 1.09 for a cup of ice on a 100 degree day",2

Service could of been better",2
Wrong order,2

Waited for 15 mins, should just go through the drive thru.",2
Waited on line for 45 mins just to place the order.,2

"Frys were cold, did not give me my large drink that was ordered, and when I asked for my receipt, 3 people just walked around lost.. said forget it and left.",2
The never has the coke icee.,2
Half the kiosk machine's where down and crowd control was missing. Someone out front directing people and helping at the kiosks would have made a very different experience.,2
They didn't have enough employees to take your order and they didn't have enough workers to make the food!!!! Horrible customer service they need to have more people working over there!!!!,2
"Dine In is NOT available. I went with family but we had to sit outside. This is the case observed in the evening in majority of outlets. Placed pickup order and manager stepped out and addressed orders one by one.
Burgers are served with ONLY bread and patty and NO vegetables.",2
Slow and rude,2
The security will kick you out if you don't finish your food in 15 mins. I was sooo shocked today when he came on me,2
Poor ,2
"I GIVE IT 2 STARS because they were quick.But on the other hand,The fries were cold,and the burgers were drenched with ketchup. Told the gentleman to hold one moment and 5 seconds later a girl came on. Like give us a minute. I normally don't write a review and I hate to leave a bad one.But you would think because it's in front of oldtown it's hot and fresh. Just got out of the hospital wanted a warm meal.",2
"It's absurd how bad the service is here. I wouldn't recommend going through the drive through. They'll mess up your order and then make you wait a long time for it again. I'd say just ignore this McDonald's entirely but if you do come to this location, do yourself a favor. Park the car and order your meal inside the fast food restaurant. It'll be faster this way.",2
"Long wait for food, not very clean inside.",2
"We stopped in for a midday snack since we were across the street at Fun Spot of America.  I placed a mobile order, the cashier didnt know that.. after standing there for 5 minutes he finally said mobile order 1634.. I raised my hand and he slide me the bag. Never",2
Hotter than Central America in there  Must have been over 40 degrees (that's Celsius).,2
Horrible customer service,2
Everything tastes the same,2

These hardships  invented by ",2
Food order was incorrect twice,2
"Dining room closes at 7pm.  No self serve beverages.  Don't understand that at all.  The food is still good though, just have to put some ketchup on a Big Mac.  ",2
I dont understand because mc Donald is a fast food place and I go thru the drive thru and  the tell me that I have to wait in one of the parking spots in stead of grab and like any normal fast food.,2
Insanely busy line around the building for the drive through out the door for walk in and order ridiculously busy customer service was friendly but order was wrong and took a long time to complete maybe they just need more employees on a Sunday morning my family is :-(,2
Urger buns taxted stale. Fries were little more than broken potato sticks. Absolutely terrible location!,2
Was ok food usually gets messed up and sometimes not so tasty at this McDonald's I used to go their all the time when I first moved up here but every single time I went their messed my order up and the food was mostly gross some is ok but not as good as other McDonald's,2
Rude customer service....smartasses,2
NVR liked McD's.  NVR eat here.,2
THE LOCATION IS A DRUG DEN RIGHT UNDER THE STAFFS NOSE. SECURITY IS A JOKE. THE CHOPPY ENGLISH OF THE MORNING MCDONALD'S FRONT LINE AND THE SECURITY STAFF LOOK LIKE AGING GANG MEMBERS,2
Food never fresh employee gets mad when you ask them to remake it overnight crew,2
Slow drive up window,2
The food was allright but the staff was very unfriendly. The need to learn how to greet people and smile.,2
They always give me the wrong salad...,2
The worst McDonald's I've ever been to,2
"Full of homeless people not like I'm unaware of our global situation with homelessness, but if you looking to sit down chill and eat don't do it at this one. It doesn't have a drive thru, so order ahead for pick up, it does have self service ordering kiosk.",2
Poor ,2
Too slow...need to be more welcoming and get orders right !,2
Not a fan of McDonald's.  This one was not real clean,2
The ladies restroom smell horrible. Moldy and mildew-y smell. Very very strong smell that I could smell through my mask.,2
Told me to pull around and wait for order. They forgot about me! They weren't busy,2
Twice I've tried to get ice cream or Mcflurry & never have it,2
"food is ok, just regular McDonald, but the drive thru is insanely back late night. 30+ mins wait time while there are just 3 customers, like how is this acceptable? Soda machine, ice cream machine, or the cashier constantly broke down. After 35 mins when I finally able to get my food, they told me no credit card, like what ? why don't you tell me 35 mins ago? just left right away.",2
Poor ,2
"It looks clean, food is like any other McDonald's.  Disappointed the playhouse is not there anymore. That really made this place worth going to. Gave the community ties to this particular mc Donald's. I'll be going to the one thats closer to my house from now on. R.I.P. RONALD MC DONALDS PLAY HOUSE.   SINCE I COULD REMEMBER - 2020.",2
Had a rude customer ahead of me in the drive thru.,2
I tried to buy a burger for a homeless lady and the manager told me no! She then approached the homeless lady and told her to leave.,2
"I used to come by here fairly often, but it's gone downhill. The one on 183 by Walmart is better.",2

Friendly staff but fries were stale!  They even took some time to put together my order giving me the appearance that a fresh batch of fries were coming out of the fryer.  I was wrong-they tasted like they were scraped off the floor.  Was here around 9pm last night.,2
Not good parking area or access. Very slow service. Very small,2
No seats in any of the floors. Too many people sleeping over the tables. I just wanted to eat in peace.,2
Poor ,2
We were waiting in drive through 20 minutes every day . The speakers broke for at least a week and there was only one girl in the store at 11 pm.. thats super cra,2
They skimped on the amount of food they served.,2
"2 different visits: The supervisor in the grey shirt was the one give out the food with an attitude like he didnt want to be bothered. And I ordered 4 apple pies at night and all of them were old, dried out, and their box had no sell by time stamped so who knows how long they been in that warmer. Probably will place my food orders elsewhere",2
Subpar customer service and meal craftsmanship.,2
Awful condition of the restaurant,2
"Dirty, sticky tables and floors. Crowded. Expect to wait a while for food ordered at kiosk and at the cashier. No table service here. Dark space. Lots of transients, though the guards do a good job of making sure people buy stuff.",2
"Fast and friendly service but absolutely filthy. No clean tables or chairs in the open areas. Bags, food and everything else under the sun on the floors. Floors sticky. Food in bathroom sinks. Only here because it",2
"No self service, slow service, they messed orders up; requested no bacon in a meal but they included it (despite being shown on the affixed sticker) however food was tasty! (albeit cold)
To add insult to injury, the staff were relatively impolite",2
We went to the drive thru today and they mest up all our order,2
Ordered 2  kiddy meals and juices were left out and they forgot the apples. Horrible service. Never again here.,2
Only go here because it's open late. Food not always the same presentation or great tasting..but it is McDonald's. What do you expect.... You know when you go there what you're getting. Cheap food..poor customer service.. And maybe your order correct.,2
Poor ,2
Ordered 2 double fish fillet sandwiches and got 1 double and 1 single. Order must be checked and double checked for Togo. I'm not coming back to change the order after few miles.,2
"This McDonald's has always been bottom-of-the-barrel as far back as I can remember, and a sleek face-lift doesn't change the fact that a visit to this McDonald's will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one, so I'll compile a list:
1. Incorrect orders 50% of the time
2. Rude employees and managers
3. Customers who are loud, offensive, and downright violent
4. Poorly made, slapped-together food

And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company, P.B.S. Parking Boot Service, and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand $200 cash in exchange for the boot removal. It seems this McDonald's is doing everything to lose business. They thrive off of convenient location alone. Absolutely terrible experience.",2
Poor ,2
Dirty.  Tight parking lot.  Too many homeless people.,2
"Took too long to complete order, dirty floor, overall impression of a badly run McDonalds - a rarity.",2
"They are unprepared to handle a crowd, long wait and food was cold.",2
2 people ahead with orders and 30 minutes of waiting for cold fries,2
"They are too slow, even slower this time around
Horrible service",2
"Food was definitely not even close to being fresh ""ish""and the location, although you'd think is convenient after visiting the zoo ... It's a wreck waiting to happen if you try to drive in to their location.",2
We hit it off pretty good in the beginning everything was great but that didnt last long. I mean the service is fast but with attitude an,2
"Seems like, they always makes some mistakes when they get busy

Rough way to complete there sandwiches

Sauce was spilled out from box and made lots of mess

Forgot to put bbq sauce for nuggets",2
"Understaffed, constantly inaccurate orders. Fries are almost always cold . Attitude given when corrections are brought to their attention. Dirty bathrooms .....",2
"They messed up our order on two different occasions in the drive thru. I do appreciate the enthusiasm they have, I also just want my order right.",2
No drive thru ?,2
Poor ,2
They dork up the kids meal every time and the fries are never fresh....but it's a standard place.,2
"They took 17 minutes for my McChicken which feels like it wouldn't take that long, and then they forgot my lettuce on it and the fries were cold, I'm wanting to bet that if I went again it would be better, but with most options out of stock I can't recommend going",2
"Slow service, bad area after hours, not very safe to eat in, recommend drive through. the food is consistent for the most part. the staff is ok but can be better. getting in and out can be cumbersome. not the best place for a date or families. It's ideal for a quick stop and go only.",2
Poor ,2
Waited 30 minutes in drive thru line be told they are out of fish and chicken,2
Warning- Check your order every time you come to this location. Guaranteed to be missing an item you ordered. Dont let them tell you,2
No worries about the time difference between us and I just asking you about the fact you have any idea what,2
"Not Brother bringing food food to table,long wait and don",2
Terrible service cold food unsalted fries the list goes on id suggest you go to whatever other mcdonalds is closest,2
Poor ,2
Third time coming and third time I've been served after a long wait. Often there is not a line yet there is still a wait. Food is good like at any other McDonalds but the service is so slow.,2
Good deals and friendly service (most of the time). The drive thru wait time is always very long.,2
Below average by McDonald's standards,2
McDonald's is McDonald's,2
The service is awful and the order is wrong more often than it should be,2
Not to friendly there . use to be better.,2
The place is clean but the food is old,2
Just like McDonald's,2
I only stopped there because my dog likes their chicken nuggets,2
Rude on the drive thru speaker and at the window the only postive was the person who  gave me my food. She was very kind and polite to me.,2
They moved fast but it wasnt very crowded. The food wasnt that good it was no salt on the fries and my burger was extrs salty. Then they gave me orange soda because they didnt have strawberry fanta but thats def not what i wanted. If im ever in the area i wont be coming back here.,2
Very busy,2
Chicken nuggets were ice cold and disgusting the French fries it was like they poured 1/2 bucket of salt on them. This is not the first time I've encountered cold overly salted food,2
"So as of late, the past month or so, they close the store randomly to save face and not overwhelm the low count of night staff they have. It's 1230 in the morning, no line and the kid working says it's going to take an hour.  When I knownfor a fact it takes about 10 to 15 min. I had placed an order on the app using my free points. Looking to get a quick bite on my Sunday night walk home from my usual business and now I'm down from 2600 points to 100 points...AND STILL HUNGARY!!!! Yall lucky you get a 2.. update I now have 1600 points O.o. yall need to properly train your staff and quite frankly I think you should just overhaul the entire place with new staff because what you have now..SUX!",2
Did the self order through the kiosk to avoid the line and still waited almost 30min for my food due to them having given out my order to someone else the first time.,2
Very dirty,2
Poor customer service,2

"Got nuggets and fries. Asked for barbeque and ketchup for the fries. Got no barbeque or ketchup, good thing we went to the big mcdonalds, enjoying dry nuggets now. At least the food was hot.",2
"I rate it as good! Nice physical space, service too. But unfortunately the place only had 1 bathroom. Men, women, children and the disabled. 1 toilet. 1 sink. 1 changer. Oh you can imagine!",2
"When I first pulled up to get breakfast at 533am the man told me to come back in 10mins. I said ""what is this? You mean I can't order food right now? Yallt breakfast from 5am and go until 11am!"" He said ok you can order, but food won't be ready for at least 5min. What was weird is soon as I ordered, my food was already ready. This particular McDonald's is way to busy and big to be pulling slack workers like that. The guy seemed like he just didn't want to help.",2
Waited ~13 minutes for a simple hot fudge sundae (seems like my order was not placed on their electronic queue). Also pretty understaffed - cashier also dropping fries into fryer and running around doing other tasks.,2
bad food bad service but usually fast and lots of them around,2
"They messed my order up 2 times. They remade my sandwich and the chicken was still raw. They have nasty attitudes. You have to use the kiosk to place your order. There is no more service with a smile. An update I now have food poisoning form the raw/ undercooked chicken I was served yesterday. Don't eat here, I will never come back here ever again. My reviews have been see by over 100,500 people.",2
Just bad service wasn't busy but the food took 15-20 mins,2
No cashier's,2
The food was hot I'm just not a fan of McDonald's but two children enjoyed it,2
2 adults ww children breakfast meals. Had to go back to service counter 3 times no eggs in meal. Then again hole in cup hot water everywhere. Then tea bag had hole in so back to counter. Food was cold by time we all sat down to eat. No apologies were given!!!!!,2
Very slow employee take forever to get you order. Im not recommended to any body this place,2
Morning staff is good....afternoon/evening is a different story. They take the fast out of fast food!,2
"Found the drive through staff to be rude on a regular basis over the course of several visits. If you can go a few miles down the road, the Sand Lake location on I-drive is much better.",2
"Went through the drive thru in a hurry to get my daughter to school, we found a hair in our food and was given the wrong drink. The manager on duty was very apologetic and gave me a refund. Even though I was disappointed with the hair in the food, we were treated very kindly and had no problem getting our money back",2
"Order was wrong despite using ordering terminal and salad had large section that was inedible, see the picture. Looked like the lettuce had been out of date for a month. Took forever as well!",2
Staff was rude,2

Ordered a large fry and they were burnt had to go back and they were still overdone,2

Dont even bother getting chicken nuggets from McDonalds anymore they are so gross,2
Medium coffee is almost 2 dollars and it,2
Went down hill for me.,2
I like very yummy,2
Better and cleaner than I thought it would be.,2
"Weird credit card layout, tea was hot, 3/4 of a cup filled up, and bland, would skip this McDonald",2
One of the worst with service. I ordered a ice latte through the app for pickup. So I go inside I wait at pickup. Drink isnt ready and other people are waiting also. I mentioned to the solo employee I had a pickup order. She says ok then goes off to make other peoples meals. So I try to be patient stood there for like 20min and never received my drink. They never canceled my drink I left and was still charged for it. Also they never sent the 1 cashier who was struggling by herself no help.,2
I Placed my order on the app on 7/21/21 and paid for meal through the app when I got close to the restaurant I place my order after arriving 10 minutes later my order was still not ready I stood at the pick up counter and had to fine someone to help me which took another five minutesThere was absolutely no one at the counter to help,2
Fries were cold and seemed like they were dropped back in the grease after already being cooked so were the nuggets.,2
"The management and staff argues with the customers and it's like a prison, and highly prejudiced in quality of service towards fellow brown folks.  It's disgusting.",2
"Staff very friendly, but dinning room always has some sort of commotion going on...",2
"Restroom was out of service with so many customers,  you would think they would have it up and running",2
"At this particular McDonald's ( Washington st. South Beach,Miami) The place is busy while the employees are moving around super slowly to get the orders prepared so the wait was a long for a McDonald's. Otherwise no complaints",2
Poor ,2

Very expensive,2
"Perhaps the most poorly run McDonalds in Texas. Visited on the weekend,  so naturally busier, but the management, attitude of employees, and physical condition make this a location, in my opinion, the worst location weve ever visited.
1. Trash everywhere, see pic for example. Trash on the floors, tables, parking lot.
2. Dirty tables. Obviously tables get dirty. So we asked if a team member could wipe down a table to remove ketchup and prior visitors",2
They have messed up my order multiple times,2
Very slow service today!!,2
"McDonald's is usually pretty bad about inventory shorts especially.
The BBQ sauce, it's just a conspiracy but if you ever been a lover of Mcys Nuggets then you know they tend to ""Forget"" the BBQ sauce. Any other sauce and it's in there. But overall I dont see my self going back anytime soon.",2
"What do you think my hamburger went against the receipt of the order, what do you think?",2
Probably the worst McDonald's restaurant I know. They can't manage to get any orders right and I've sat in their drive thru on several occasions for a few minutes with nobody covering it. Terrible,2
Old chiken nd so many baggers inside the Macdonald....,2
Very..very slow.  Nice looking McDonald's but I won't go back to this one.,2
New renovated McDonalds but the food taste old. I bought an,2
"Don't waste your time or money. We were excited to visit here with out of town guests straight from the airport.
1. Kiosks are backed up with a bunch of people each so no where to stand, wait, or snake through with trays of food. Kiosks were glitchy and blanked out every minute.
2. It is at least 10 degrees warmer upstairs so NOT comfortable at all.
3. Even with our order number on the table no one ever brought food...after 20 minutes, i went down stairs and it was sitting there. Then there is no drink station upstairs so with an already full tray, i had to bring food up and then come down for drinks. So why did i have to pick a flavor if the only deliver an empty?
4. No one to help with service or questions. Lady upstairs spoke no English. I had to raise my hand at the counter after standing there 5 minutes to find my food just to get acknowledged.
5. After all that, found one sandwich missing. Went back again and notified i was missing the cheese steak and staff member walked to the other pasta section where it was sitting by itself.
6. Cheeseburgers were not made to order as requested on the kiosk.
7. Big mac was dry. Worst one ever.

We won't be back.",2
Chain,2

"A friendly and responsive staff delivered (twice after I brought it back) coffee that was not hot. After the second time, I just gave my cup to my daughter whose iced coffee was way too light with cream and diluted. Surprised that McDonalds quality control failed on this visit.",2
"All I had was a hot fudge sundae, which was good. The restaurant did not have running water at the time though so I was unable to wash my hands in the bathroom or to order a soda. They legally should not have been open. They were still running things as usual though.",2

The food was ok but I have experienced better service. They missed things... The tables were in bad condition and the floor was not cleaned since ages.,2
"This people always try to rush you on the drive through and even if you go inside store, there are always problems with food, last time I went over there I had 2 cold cheese burgers, had to wait for my wife's food and came the wrong way. If you want to eat bacon, tomato and onions good luck trying to find them in burgers, there are just 1 piece to none hahaha.",2
"This McDonald's has a group of homeless people that take up many seats by the bathrooms. Unfortunately, they add a bad odor to the area where they congregate.",2
Did not help me with a refund and took awhile to convince worker to take a look at kiosk to fix it.,2
"Dirty front area, lots of flies..",2
Too many mistakes here,2
"Every time I've eaten there I've never seen an employee clean or wipe down a table.  Always sticky and I've had  to use water and napkins to clean the tables before eating.  I'd think they would at least watch and take care of this situation.   Also, very drafty from AC over tables and if you want to have warm food eat fast.   I've asked if they could turn the AC down a bit, but they said they couldn't.
Picking another MD now.",2
"Unfortunately today while waiting in line (pulled to the side not in the drive through lane) my frappe was given to the person behind me. She graciously didn't take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it. I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back. I was very confused by this, especially in Covid times. I requested a different drink, no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe. The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again. Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this ",2
"About half of my visits are pretty terrible but it's a drive thru option that's on my way to work.  Today my ""bacon egg and cheese bagel"" had no bacon.  $8.99 for a missing ingredient is absolutely ridiculous.",2
Slow as hell,2
I go to McDonald's cause it's cheap and I use my McD's app a lot too.,2
Horrible service  besides they are very unhygienic and take a long time to attend ,2
"The food was cold, I couldn't sit in the restaurant to eat it and the service was slow. Not to mention overpriced for what they gave me.",2
"Never get my order right in the drive through then told to pull over we will bring your food in a moment. Defeated the whole point of the drive thru experiance dont you think. If it wasnt for my child wanting his happy meal, I myself always make it a point to skip this place.",2
I'm not sure what anyone who has lived in Utah expects when trying to dine in this area. It's pretty common knowledge that downtown is the heart of the homeless and many drug addicts. Not to mention this location is one block from pioneer park and very close to the road home/gateway area. I'm not excusing any rude or bad experiences but maybe just a bit more patience and compassion? It's fast food. Don't like the area? Dine elsewhere.,2
Super long wait times. Not helpful staff. Not the best mcdonalds i have been to.,2
"The morning crew is professional, to they are a stellar group,  but the midnight shift is horrible, food is cold, desserts we're squashed and when I showed them the muffins she said""that's how they came out""",2

We really can't understand how hard it can be to complete our order. Every single time we go they make multiple mistakes n it's so frustrating.,2

"Not so good. Order drive through, but found out to food is not what I order (extra charge). Play ground is poor maintained. It is much worse now compared to my visit eleven years ago.",2
Not to crazy about,2

"Hate coming here, I'm going through the drive-thru there's like multiple homeless people just knocking at your window",2
"For one usually it's only for coffee and to get away from the office as I stopped eating McDonald's food. The problem I faced recently was a homeless person who walked up to me and asked for 2 dollars for bus fare. When the bus stop is like 2 to three blocks down the road. I said I will buy you something to eat or drink but not give money. So,  for folks or tourists who get folks coming to them asking for money I suggest trying to offer food to them is more important then money. One thing about DC is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find. Food too they know where to go. It's up to them to make that move. Another major situation I noticed is the McDonald's need some updating. I might know why they keep it so dull looking because McDonald's operates with the homeless so I guess they don't want to make it too comfortable. I been to much better ones who got nice and cool lounge chairs couches and OMG this one just looks ragged.",2
McDonald's is gross. Shoddy craftsmanship,2
The food and workers are great. It's the people outside begging that really... You know..... ,2
I like that it is animal theme and has a playground but the cashiers are rude and they can't get your order right so they get mad when you tell them you are missing something. Also they are dirty.,2
"Still a good place to go to, but it seems that the management rather serve drive-thru than inside service. Having to wait for the drive-thru to finish  before waiting on inside customers makes you want to go somewhere else ",2
"Well it might have been ok, if I was not rushing, but I still stayed for my items. For this to be McDonald's, they should know that it's busier during certain hours then others..there were soo many ppl in line, the average person would have turn right back around n walked out.",2
Didn't have any more packs of peanuts for the sundaes... Disappointing and this is at 7 pm!,2
Coffee sometimes is more water and milk.,2
It's ok.the service stinks took too long,2
Poor ,2
Lines are usually quite long and don't move very fast. If you need a quick meal go across the street to Fresh & Co.,2
"I was told that I had to buy something in order for my young child to use the restroom.

Not a problem but please speak to your customers with some level of respect. Not yelling or sounding extremely annoyed.",2
didn't get the sauces I asked for,2
Girl taking orders in the drive through didn't listen very well. Asked for 2 hashbrowns it was never added to my order. I said it 3 times.,2
Poor ,2
"Ordered bacon big mac, got a burger with no bacon. service was fast though..probably explains lack of bacon",2
?,2
My breakfast sandwich bread was so burnt it was inedible...,2
not healthy place,2
Usually come here because they have their stuff together. Today was the exact opposite. Hit the drive through for 2 things and it took over 30 minutes. Had to wait in the parking lot for a big mac meal and a happy meal???,2
Yuck!,2
"Good like any other McDonalds in the world, but this location like Chic-fil- a here in Abilene  need to do something with the traffic jams they cause!! Franchise owner need to stop by and use the drive thru and feel the Pain!!",2
French fries hard as a rock.,2
Poor ,2
Slow.,2
"Earthworm burgers?
",2
Too much wait at midnight. Burger had unsatisfing taste and coke had no soda,2
Poor ,2
"Fast food, fast service. Low quality meals. But, you will probably already know that because it is a McDonald's fast-food, and not a whole foods Cafe organic foods.
The food price is above normal for what you are getting. So, the value is low in the area of food quality for the price. What you are paying for is convenience. They have a very fast drive-thru.",2
They are overpriced and had no condiments,2
Forgot my nuggets,2
Mosr of the food was delivered after we were sent to the parking lot since it was 2 big breakfasts and a mcgriddle with 3 drinks. Food was delivered within a few minutes but after waiting 10 minutes we had to go back into the drive through. Because they forgot our drinks. After we went back they gave it and when we went home they forgot to give us straws and the extra hashbrown we ordered. Food good but lacking service. Very nice cashier lady but the food handler wasnt as nice.,2
Breakfast was cold,2
Their ubereats need to be more attention to detail n packed nice not just thrown in always missing something i asked for bought the big breakfast meal and got sent no silverware no syrup nothing like Damn how am i going to eat this i even put a note in the app to add napkins and condiment n still can't receive it what's the point of leaving a note if no one reads it I've order different times and never fail to disappoint me,2
Poor ,2
Really Slow service.,2
"Order was wrong. Paid for 2 double hamburgers, received 2 single hamburgers. Drive-thru took forever despite being empty.",2
Poor ,2
"This is by far the cheapest place to eat at Waikiki beach. Unfortunately, that also makes it a very attractive spot for all the drug addicts and homeless of the city. While I generally don't mind homeless people, eating next to a meth addict on a bad trip is not the most pleasant experience. Not one since you can get sick full for 5$.",2
"We were not impressed with this location. They locked the doors at lunch and only ran the drive-through. We made it inside, but that wasn't much better. The workers were not friendly and I had to order at a kiosk.",2
The only thing worse than the service was the food. My wife's Big Mac tasted like it had been dropped in an ashtray.,2
Poor ,2
Poor ,2
The dining area was dirty. No straws or napkins available. Crispy tenders were undercooked,2
Park is very worn down with minimal area for kids. Bathrooms are messy and unkempt. However the food is still good and as expected just that it can be extremely dirty at points,2
Sure would have been nice if FF were HOT,2
Food is always cold and takes forever.,2
they don't have the full menu available.,2
Very rude female employee. Look like she didnt wanted to work,2
Poor ,2
"Didnt eat dinner, so I ord",2
"parking is a nightmare, WAY too many homeless near by",2
"Ehhh. Mcdonald really isnt something I do a lot, and last time it wasn't good. Fries were cold, burger sucked. Even my drink was wrong....so I wasnt happy with my last meal here.",2
very dirty bathroom the place it self had a lot of homeless people hang out their .,2
Spent 20 minutes inline at the drive through and the iced coffee was still very bland and unlike its normal taste,2
"Was so excited for my first time coming to the big McDonalds  because I was told you could order special menu items. First disappointment. Second, not only were there no numbers to grab once you ordered your food, but we waited over an hour for a ham and cheese French toast, (that we watched sit in the window under a heater that wasnt even working for over 20 mins) a McDouble and Big Mac and a frozen coffee (that was half melted). Very disappointing. Will NEVER go back. The employees were all chi",2
They take their time a little too much.,2
"Over cooked chicken, over salted fries, wrong drinks.",2
Poor ,2
"They watered their parking lot with a poorly-engineered irrigation syztem right before days of hard freeze,let everyone skate through the ice for a day before closing during the majority of the freeze when everyone needed a hot meal.
Whataburger stayed open and served a limited menu to support Roanoke.",2
"A rather dirty place, the toilets were filthy.
We waited more than 20min to be served (fast food...)
Far from being the best McDonald's we've had...",2
Poor ,2
What ever happened to fast service and hot food you get neither at this place,2
This is my third time visiting this store horrible place to eat all the 3 person at the service desk did not even eye contact with me and after food ready they just damp my order on the desk and I had to asked one gentleman if that was my order then he said  yes horrible place will not recommend it,2
"This location took really long to process orders and get their line moving. I even had a mobile order, and at about 10:15pm I had to take the drive through. Took 20 minutes. They kept putting the wrong order on the screen at the ordering area. Guy who talked to me was pretty rude when I tried to let him know what was going on. Pretty sure it the gentleman in a tie that gave me my receipt.",2
Indoor playground smells of mold. The ceiling and ventilation have black mold.,2
Dirty and dirty people.,2
Got two quarter pounders. Both COLD. So they do not make when ordered.,2
The food was ok but way over priced for a McDonald's and the fries had no flavor.  I dont suggest it.,2
Poor ,2
"Waited in line for half an hour, and it seemed like forever at the pick-up window.  I asked if they were short staffed, and she said they were waiting on the fries. But when I got them they were cold. She offered no explanation until I got tired of waiting",2
The music they play suck please get rid of it put some 50s 60s and 70s,2
Very slow service today!!,2
"Bad service, cold food. Never go there",2
"No drive thru, have to oder using a board, not a person. Ugh!",2
I dont understand because mc Donald is a fast food place and I go thru the drive thru and  the tell me that I have to wait in one of the parking spots in stead of grab and like any normal fast food.,2
Slow but good,2
"The food is good but the service is bad, nobody pays attention to you",2
Poor service  I had a 20 nugget 2 medium fries a m caramel frappe and medium mocha frappe they charged me for a small mocha and salad dressing she charged me the difference but they almost gave me a small I had to ask why they charged me that also they neglect to let you know they dont have caramel or chocolate and when I asked they just told me there isn't any with attitude,2
Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional. If you are a tourist and don't know when it is cash only you don't get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on. The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help. I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude.,2
This particular day service was very slow. Took eleven minutes to get my order and another customer asked for their money back.,2
Poor ,2
Communication can be an issue. English is not the first language for a lot of their employees.,2
Poor ,2
this place close soo early,2
Slow service and the food was wrong not once but twice. Complete waste of time and money,2
"Quick service. Burgers were barely hot??? A lot of aggressive homeless people in the area. A woman approached my son and I while we were dining inside and asked, ""Would you mind sharing some chicken?"" Nope. Never Again!",2
"Line for drive-thru was slow, and when we got up to order, literally a third of the menu said that it was not in stock. ""Be back soon"". We ended up not ordering.",2
Poor ,2
Inconsistent  customer servicing!,2
"Very busy,  mad customers, long wait times for orders.  The staff is trying their best but can't keep up.  They need a new streamlined process and only one conductor.",2
It's McDonald's....,2
They get an extra Star because their staff 8 of 10 have been polite. Drive through has issues. They constantly get order wrong. Ask you to pull forward to fix and leave you hanging. I have had to go in twice to see why I am still sitting after five minutes. They are new. I understand training new people. But when you place an order and they repeat it back correctly and it comes out wrong or you have to repeat 3 times to make sure they get it right. Someone inside needs to make sure they are reading the whole ticket. Not just a quarter pounder. Especially with the multi menu choice of adding bacon or lettuce and tomatoes. Their tea as of late has tasted like dish soap and their fountain drinks have a funky taste to them. Numerous times their fries have been under cooked.,2
Ordered 2 double fish fillet sandwiches and got 1 double and 1 single. Order must be checked and double checked for Togo. I'm not coming back to change the order after few miles.,2
"I really wanted to looooove this Mc Donalds store since they are the biggest in the world. But being this ""famous"" comes with a price: overcrowded and short staff. People were mad in the line asking for the food, saying they ordered their meal 30 minutes ago. Hello?30 minutes? This is insane. Very tourist location. I just wish the manager would hire more people to work there so they can attend that much of people.",2
Rude!!!!.....and they gave me the wrong order.,2
Slow service and the food was wrong not once but twice. Complete waste of time and money,2
McD's needs to stop messing with the $1 sodas!!,2
Typical mcdonalds I guess. The fries we tossed they were still frozen we watched them dump them in than scoop and fry them kinda gross. Should of been tossed out entirely,2
"Drive thru very slow, stop bye after work took about 20 minutes to get food and that's at 12:30 am .",2
"I've worked in the neighborhood for decades and this was always a decent go to place for a late night snack.

A couple of years ago they modified the interior- they removed a lot of seats on the main floor in order to install electronic order kiosks.  There are now only a handful of places to sit in a ridiculously cramped manner.  Late at night they close the upstairs- leaving pretty much nowhere decent to sit and eat.  Tonight I saw two people eating over the garbage cans and one eating by the soda dispenser.

The kiosks are annoying.  They ask if you want to take out or eat there.  If you select ""Eat In"", before you can pay for your order you're asked to get a table marker and enter the marker number.  Thing is there are absolutely no table markers- you cannot complete your order without one- unless yout over and select ""take out"".

During the day perhaps eating in makes sense- but late at night it's really only for take out.",2
"Extremely slow due to the lack of staff, expensive compare to those around the city! Don't recommend.",2
There was not a long wait in the drive thru but the food was cold and stale.   Fries un salted and cold fish sandwich was dry and sad.   Will not be going back,2
"During the Daytime its alright, but at night they block one of the entrances with trash cans and lock the other one. (EVEN THOUGH THE SIGN STATES 24HR DINING ROOM) So you're forced to drive through. I didnt expect much but whatever....",2
"The drive through at this McDonald's has always been busy every time I've gone.  It's honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a hurry.  I've been stuck in the drive thru line for over 15 minutes on several occasions just ordering a single cheeseburger.  Granted, compared to In and Out that's nothing, but this is McDonalds.  That aside, the interior has always been pretty clean when I've went inside.  If you go for breakfast on the weekends, once again, be prepared to wait.  They do take Apple Pay and Android pay!  The one time I used it, the person behind the counter actually knew what it was.  So many places tell you they don't have it but just don't know what it is.  Another big plus is the drive through is 24 hours.",2
Bad service. Very dirty. Bums are everywhere  begging for something. And did i mention very dirty? I'd go somewhere else next time.,2
"Dirty place, slow service",2
Too bad I only bought two coffees and it took me more than 19 minutes and they still moved me to the parking lot and then I had to return because they didn't take what I bought with them lousy service,2
Food getting bland...service good... atmosphere a bit outdated,2
"Use the drive through to order. The girl gave me the wrong flavor soda. I told her what i ordered and she gets angry and says ok, pull up to the next window for your soda.
I say no, I'll wait here, please just give me my soda. She would rather argue then just fill the cup with soda. She tells me that I'm making everyone in the drive through wait. I said no McDonald's sloppy order taking is making me wait. I encourage everyone to not pull up out of the way when fast food restaurants screw up. They do that so ""corporate"" doesn't yell at them for having slow initial order to window pickup time. Do the job right and orders will be fast.",2
No pride in their service any more...,2
I had a fly in my mc flurry...and i got yelled at about it ... im sorry.. last i checked the customer was right...,2
Meh,2
Severe robbery. very little food,2
Good,2
"The burgers are constantly underdone, but the manager is usually ok with exchanging them. Originally they would try to explain its a temp cook, and I had to tell them I can",2
Ordered curbside. The attendant came out to tell me that my apple pie would take 15 minutes and he couldn't cancel it. He said he can substitute for cookies. 15 minutes later I had my order with cookies and still no apple pie. Frustrating. Their soft drinks are always hit or miss as well because the balance of syrup and water is never correct,2
Food was way too salty line was way too long service was way too slow,2
"Filthy location, garbage on the seating and tables with grease and mold on floor corners.  we walked out because I can't image how it looks like in the kitchen & food preparation area.",2
Orders are always wrong.... double check...,2
Poor ,2
That's all you get. Service is mediocre.,2
"Started with me having to get the attention of the Drive thru by saying hello to the order com because 2 cars had passed on my right while i was waiting. Then I pulled up to receive my order I was given my drinks but was missing the one from my Happy Meal order as I asked for it and the person at the window looked at me like what was I talking about I said that i am missing a drink and again he looked at me like I was tring to get something again i mentioned that i have 3 orders with a beverage and a frap but i am still missing one then he began to say ok it is coming just pull forward to the next window as i pulled forward they brought me my items and still no drink and was still missing items again they looked at me like i did not know what i was saying and then finally got my HM drink but i was still missing items was told they are in the oven again waited 10 min with no one coming to the window to inform me of the wait I went to the window where thire was a person and again he was confused on why i was still in there line waiting on food, then the manger came to the window asking what is the problem I said I am still missing my apple pies he being to tell me they are in the oven and it takes 10 min I asked am i still waiting at the other window or am i pulling to a number lane he said no next window so I pull back up and wait another 7 more min I have now been waiting 20 min for my items.  If it was communicated that the wait will be a long wait, I would not have felt forgotten at the window.",2
Very expensive and super bad service. The place was clean.,2
I got 3 sloppy vanilla ice cream cones today.,2
No order in. Covid 19 you sure did a number on us.,2
Incredibly understaffed.,2
Washroom was filthy... likely due to the number of Street people that frequent the place.  Management not concerned Street people filling up on soda.,2
"this McDonald's was full of homeless people, and they had a security guard at the door and there was no place to sit because all the homeless people had all the tables.",2
"The food was okay, but the service was horrible. I was even told to have a good night or anything like that. They need better customer service",2
"The food & service is excellent & if you are taking the food out it's great. However if you plan to stay & eat inside, there are many homeless people inside & the odors from the bathrooms dies not make it pleasant. Must clean up the odors inside if they want me back",2
"Curbside is a joke
Waited for 15 mins, should just go through the drive thru.",2
"My experience visiting this place was not good. It was not because the place that is a nice building with many things to do specially for kids but for the service. This McDonald's offers Pasta and Pizza and I had the terrible idea of order a pizza along with many other things. I have to wait more then an hour and 15 minutes for it.  The place was plenty of tourists many of them in groups like mine and most of them had the same problem. The staff attention was not good. They were overwhelmed and didn't warning about the long waiting time. In some cases one hour and a half. This is considered the largest McDonald's in the World so it is another tourist attraction in the city. They should improve their service, especially in the pizza area. As a positive comment, I received a second ration of one of my orders for free in retribution for the long wait. My recomendation is not to order pizza if you are in a hurry, with a large group and during busy times.",2
"This store is so disorganized, plenty of people working not all that busy yet took 27 minutes to get food. I'm sure this is not the mcDonalds model.",2
"I ordered based on a picture of the sandwich and did not have lettuce, tomatoes etc.",2
Poor ,2
When you go to McDonald's you are expecting fast and consistent food. Not the case here. My order came out 16 minutes after I ordered and the sandwich was on the wrong bread.,2
Rare bustling place to eat in this part of Bay Side on Byscayne Boulevard. Lack of better between 3 skyscrapers!,2
"I recommend going here if you've ever cut me in line, chewed loudly during a movie, or screwed me over in general, as this place tends to take longer than most and taste worse too. I've gotten some poor service on multiple occasions. I'd say I won't ever be back, but this McDonalds is open late and too close to my house.",2
Not the best place to go your  Older is never right,2
"Sold a ""McFlurry"" then delivered an un-blended pile of ice cream topped with crumbs.",2
I had to go around the drive through 3 times to get everything that I ordered. Though people where usually very nice and apologetic.,2
"Coffee never sweet, burgers always cold",2
There was a constant beeping sound that none of the employees seem to care. The tables were greasy with fries everywhere. At least the food was made fast. But I still recommend using another McDonald's.,2
Not so safe but good worker's,2
Staff inattentive gave me wrong food 3 times.,2
Inconsistent customer service. Nothing really positive to report.,2
"No idea why they completely neglected the dining room, trash cans overflowing, trays of trash everywhere and all the condiments, napkins etc empty.",2
At least they got my order right.,2
Bad service that don't give me what you order,2
Very slow service,2
When I told the cashier my drink wasnt right he argued with me that that's how they make them there.  No way!,2
The lobby is open but you stand there for quite some time before your order gets taken. All attention is on drive thru,2
"Gave me the wrong burgers, and seemed very dirty. I did come again though and the food was correct and tasted like normal McDonald",2
because the sausage mcmuffin is reasonably priced and it confuses me when ask for one I always get the overpriced awful one,2
DID not fix my sandwich correctly,2
It's McDonald's,2
"Standard iced black coffee, from 250-01 Northern Blvd, little neck store. Give your employees a reference!!",2
Always seem to end up with missing items from my order,2
"Not gonna lie, my nuggets came kinda undercooked.",2
"Good  service, but I had told the waitress   not to take my tray and that.... I had to go out to get a portable battery for my phone. Upon doing so, the security officer harassed me about smoking when I had not lit my smoke.i then waited for his instructions when heted to speak  it was in espaniol and he pointed toward the street. I was somewhat confused and a bit worried about my LG. Coffee and a set of gloves.so my question  is why. Make your restaurant so user friendly and then harass it's patrons after a good dining experience?",2
11:15 at night and sitting in mine for 30 minutes and the line hasn,2
Service here is real slow and they are not short handed and I only ordered 2 drinks. Order takers and person that seats you are the only high points to this McDonald's.,2
Its ok  could be better i say its just to many homeless people dine un n have a bad smell  of sweat  n people get high in bathroom  n leave needle n bags of drugs on floor dirty at time smell homeless people  askin for money harass people who eat in McDonalds,2
Poor ,2
"Food was definitely not even close to being fresh ""ish""and the location, although you'd think is convenient after visiting the zoo ... It's a wreck waiting to happen if you try to drive in to their location.",2
Drive thru is pretty slow.,2
"Horrible aggressive customers, I feel bad for the employees. Long lines inside and out. Efficient employees at the time I went.",2
I today sat in line For 40minutes for a order. They need more staff if that case,2
Poor ,2
They messed my order up.,2
"I was there to separate times one time I paid over $2 more than the second
time and got the exact same thing",2
"The place in Google said open 24 hs, we went there by 11 pm and it was closed",2
Food is typical for McDonald's. I decided to eat in but alarms were loud and constant the entire time I was there. Several people working and ignoring the various buzzers and chimes. This will keep me from returning.,2
Too crowded inside and in the drive-thru. Did not get a chance to eat there. Looks nice though.,2
Dirty place,2
Horroble service ill never go back again,2
Poor ,2
"Ok, so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken nuggets, I personally prefer the Wendy's spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh tasting. The McDonald's Spicy Nuggets were Spicy alone, add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you sweat!!! But mine were extremely dry and hard, one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was interesting, I can say I tried them but I was not impressed.",2
I did not die.,2
Everything is overpriced and the fountain for drinks is behind the counter. AND they charge extra for mayonaisse,2
good place to stop by if you need to pee,2
"The price is good using the McDonald's app with the dollar coke, what is the point of giving free French fries when they are cold. They were absolutely been trashed. Customer service was good this time.",2
"The best thing about this McDonald's is the cleanliness compared to most McD restaurants in Queens. The worst thing about it is the staff. They pay no mind to customers waiting in line to have their order taken even when it isn't even busy in the slightest. Sometime they don't give me my receipt. Sometime my order will be ready in the bag, but they'll set it aside, and realize it much later, as I watch them complete other orders wondering why mine is taking too long, and it turns out my order was read all along, they just never bother to call the number. I can go on and on... almost everyday it's something different.
Two is the best I can do.",2
"One of the worst run McDonalds. Chaos inside. The order kiosks were only partially working, long wait times and at least 4 people had problems with their orders. Needs a lot of attention.",2
"Not Brother bringing food food to table,long wait and don",2
Service is slow and not very friendly. First and last visit.,2
"Their coke taste bad, as they used over chlorinated water for mixing.",2
Is not my first time going there but today food was cold,2
Poor ,2
"Nicer now that it's been remodeled but I don't know why they got rid of the kid's play area. I dined in today and my food took a long time. The chicken in my salad was not good, had tough pieces. I ate half and threw the rest out. The manager was super nice with exchanging my son's toy though.",2
Average,2
"The place is a mess. They take your order but when you pick it up, it is different of your request. The kiosks don't work. There is a strange smell near the cashiers.",2
"It was terrible, took forever. Only giving 2 because the McMuffin was good.",2
Poor ,2
"Poor service and always crowded. But hey it's McDonald's,  what should we expect.",2
Staff super rude nothing comes out correctly or good,2
"Today, i was disappointed in that restaurant #11853 did not get me my FULL order, meaning I did not receive my condiments for my big breakfast with hot cakes. No butter, no syrup, and no utensils. Luckily this was a hiccup and not a regular thing. Oh, and the egg was half the size of the sausage.",3
"Me and my girlfriend came tonight to pick up our food after 11pm for a mobile order, they need a better system if you are walking on foot. The food tasted great, loved the McDonald's deal ordering from the app.",3
They got our order correct and didn't cut me off before I had finished ordering our food at the speaker. I could actually understand our order taker. I don't know if it really gets any better than that at a fast food place anymore.,3
Yup. Its McDona,3
They run out of fry containers and constantly forget sauces. The dining room is still closed for some reason so have fun getting back in line for a sauce. Sometimes the fries aren't great which is a huge part of McDonald's. Come on guys...,3
"My nuggets were way to salty and crunchy which means to had been sitting there a while, cashier cut me off in the middle of my order but was nice and polite when I addressed it and fries where kinda cold but another then good place to get food at an affordable price",3
"Alright I know it was 5:25 in the morning when we came here and the worker was probably tired as hell. I will give him that for sure, but it was just odd pulling up to the machine and total silence. we had to say ""hello?"" before he came on and asked what we wanted. Was seemingly rude about it and not amazingly friendly. You do not have to sound peppy and full of life at 5am, but at least be nice..",3
"Decent McDonald's location.  The team here has always been friendly.  Drive thru can get pretty backed up during normal meal periods, so often it is better to go inside.  Make sure you go close to regular meal periods for fresher food vs the ones under the heat lamp for a while.    Store is always clean.",3
"When I order during the day, I have zero issues. They are listed as a 24 hour location, so they show up on Uber Eats late at night. Anytime I order after midnight, they will accept my order through UE and then sit around for an hour before cancelling it. I don't understand why you list yourselves as a 24 hour location if you cancel any orders after midnight. Other than that, this place has always given great service.",3
"This place is okay. It has these kiosks where you order, take a number, and they bring the food to your table. I ordered a frozen lemonade, paid for it, then sat down. I was there for a bit before someone came and told me they were out. I got a regular drink instead but it was too much trouble to get a refund for the difference. I'm not sure I like this new way.",3
I work for Doordash and when I go to pick up orders at night I spend 20 minutes of my time just waiting in the drive thru line. There has to be a easier way for this to get done.,3
I tried the spices chicken nugget sauce for the first time. It was like a thick Tabasco and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would! I ate that instead of my burger.,3
24 hour drive through but theyt breakfast only around 4 am which I find irritating af. I did not go there at 4:20am for a egg McMuffin,3
Meh! It's McDonald's what can I say you get what you pay for. Don't expect the place to be clean or the employees to be over the moon with courtesy. Like I said you get what you pay for. This is not a bad review it's just a Meh review because it's McDonalds. It's not like you're eating at a five-star Resort and getting a massage afterwards. However if McDonald's does decide one of these days tot serving alcohol I might have to pay it another visit. I don't go to McDonald's often. I only stopped in out of convenience. Like I said this is not a bad review to disrespect McDonald's in any way.,3
Hit and miss on getting my order right.  They are always quick to get the food out and it's generally hot and fresh.  What they lack in accuracy they seem to focus on in speed of service.,3
"The wait time was not good, my fries was warm, and my order was wrong. I didn't feel like waiting another 15 minutes for some hot fries and revised order.",3
"Couldn't get a order right. When I got home they had the burgers all wrong. Tried to call and for a hour and a half they never answered
Was really disappointed !",3
Staff has changed and service isn't great.,3
"Decent for junk food, but each extra packet of your desired sauce costs an extra $.25. Good and quick staff.",3
"Typically love going here, hate that I ordered a medium and got a small instead this morning. Even asked her if she was sure that was a medium and she said yes.",3
Hadn't been to McDonald's in a couple years it was better    THAN thought it was gonna beDidn't have a choice,3
Average service and wait time. Food is usually hot! No complaints.,3
"Our order was wildly messed up and it took them two times to fix it, but they did it with a great attitude and smile.",3
Standard food and service. It was quick and efficient. The outside parking lot and drive-thru area was dirty and grungy.,3
"Only drive thru open, didn't want to eat in the car so didn't order anything",3
"Very slow drive thru.  Person at window where you pay was very nice however, the lady at 2nd window didn't even smile.",3
"Missing food, used mobile app no way to get refund for missing items in app",3
Not bad not great but almost always open,3
Some people here don't like to protect others because they don't fully cover their nose and mouth with the masks!,3
Food was a little cool. Big Mac was dry and lacking ..i like my McDonalds fresh and hot !!,3
"Ordered the 2 filet-o-fish for $5 , and they were barely hot.",3
It's McDonald's. I like getting breakfast here it tastes okay and is super convenient and fairly cheap.,3
You have to be more careful and packing up the food through the drive-thru,3
McDonald's is McDonald's what great thing's happen here the same menu forever,3
"One refill per visit, no ice cream ever, the crew employees are professional though",3
"Order was wrong, French fries were cold and too salty, milk shake was melted",3
Usually they they have the best coffee but yesterday it was watery and not that good,3
Not as fast as you'd like sometimes but still. And cheaper than some of the other McDonald's around.,3
"Completely average; unclean, cheap, cool but occasionally absentminded staff.",3
Clean place good music on sound system close to discount movies,3
"As always, bleh food, but great bathrooms.",3
They are good on certain days,3

"Food came out at different times for a dine in. Then it was wrong sandwich like usual for a McDonald's. But what put this over the top was the employee's. 1 female worker came out screaming somebody stole $200 from her purse, then the manager acted like  she wasn't even there. Extremely wrong way to act or even pose as a manager. Then the Boyfriend came in of the victim employee and they called the cops on him because he demanded his girlfriend money to be rightfully returned. Meanwhile 2 other employee's stated that they had money stolen from the as well over the last few weeks. Definitely not a well run establishment or managed. I'd highly recommend not eating inside this place. And keep yourself locked in your car. You might get robbed by an employee.",3
Children make bad employees and simple tasks like filling the fries all the way up don't happen and salt isn't added.,3
"My go to McDonald's  The staff is always polite and I will keep coming back!

Well tonight sucked, 25min wait in a spot for my food to come out:( I'll be",3
"Went through the drive through went fairly quick. Order was correct. No napkins, didn't ask if we wanted ketchup or any condiments when given our food. Chicken nuggets were barely warm and a little bitter due to oil needing to be changed. The guy that took our order did as what dipping sauce we wanted though!!! Bun for the Quarter Pounder was stale and loaded with a lot of big, thick onions!!! Had to throw most of onions away!!! Average experience nothing to brag about though!!!",3
"They're pretty good at not forgetting any items but thr other day they forgot my large fries and got charged for it.  To the wonderful woman during the early shift in  window 2 Thank you for always being so attentive and friendly,  you rock! ",3
Fine service.  Gave me the wrong meal.,3
Unfortunately McDonald's prices aren't worth the food you get.,3
Salads are not sold there anymore and neither are grilled chicken sandwiches but I think that is common in many McDonald's now. I'm gluten free so a salad would have been nice for lunch today. Won't be going back there anytime soon.,3
"The people n place are great . Its the same deals every day , d",3
"The parking availability is sufficient for customer volume.

Im on the fence about this restaurant. Ive had terrible service (cold food, old fries, wilted/brown vegetables, bad attitudes, etc.

That being said, I",3
Slow service inside take out.for breakfast.. waited over 15 minutes for 2 coffee and a egg mcmuffin. Staff were not very sociable. And didn't explain what was taken so long for wait..been thru this bad service before ..but now I will not be going back,3
"I don't believe they were busy when we came in and it was subpar... They should be cleaning the tables, sweeping the floor and putting ice in their soda machine.",3
"I always loved McDonald's fries,  but I definitely do not recommend their bacon cheese fries.  Running errands I was so hungry and went to the drive up window ordered the bacon cheese fries,  The Box is so inconvenient to try to get the fries out of without messing your hands up, the cheese was cold,  and there was so much gristle in the bacon.",3
They got 2 out or 3 wrong,3
LOVE THE  FRIES! TYPICAL FAST FOOD DINE-,3
Not bad,3
It always takes a long time to get the food sometimes they are rude,3
They are doing good even though they are VERY short staffed. It took 15mins in total to get our food.,3
good food BUT they need to be more careful at the drive thru- Forgetting parts of an order when someone doesn't live in direct vicinity can be a real hassle.,3
"I've been coming here for years, but this was the first time they screwed up my order.  I would give it a higher rating if they didn't take out the play area.",3
"They mess up my coffee order kind of often, which is why I stopped going to Dunkin. But at least at McDonald's they kind of own the mistake and apologize.",3
I tried their apple fritter today. It was hard and dry. Tasted OK. They shouldn't serve them day old.,3
Biscuits are still tasty. Portions are smaller.  Prices are higher.,3
"Mornings are their best time, anytime when lunchts after expect your order to be screwed up even if it's only 2 sandwiches. Happens every to every other time but it's the only McDonald's around us.",3
Waited at drive through for about 30 mins and I was only the 3rd car away from pick up window. Very nice staff but the wait was frustrating,3
"Just okay food; nothing spectacular.  Chicken was bland and not seasoned enough.   Also, meat was on the skimpy side considering the chicken dinner is $10 and Chivo (or goat) is $14!",3
"For a fast food burger,  the quarter  pound deluxe was actually pretty good. Not like back yard grilling, decent.",3
"Long line at drive-thru, seemed like under manned. Food was OK",3
Unfortunately had to eat here cause the BF wanted to go there. I hate MD food in itself  but the people at this MD were cool none the less.,3
It's a McDonald's. Enough said. Clean. Parking is extremely small and the spaces very tight. Good luck getting a large SUV in there,3
"It's okay for a fast food place, though it's not going to win any awards for cleanliness, especially in the bathrooms.",3
Not really a  fast food eater but when ur hungry n on the go its a great pit stop,3
Convenient location right off the highway. Food preparation needs improvement. Staff friendliness is okay...(about average).,3
Drive thru gets clogged and go inside I'm 1 of 2 customers it took longer than drive thru,3
"It is McDonald's. You know what to expect. This particular one, however, often has ""machines down"" or being ""cleaned"". Can't get a latte, can't get a milkshake, etc. Kind of ridiculous.",3
I am not a McDonald's fan but I can say the place was very clean and the young girl that took my order was pleasant,3
Just another McD's. Slightly sub-par breakfast sandwiches. Weak wifi.,3
"Typical visit. But what sucked was, by the time we got our food, the fries were cold. :(",3
Would have been five but our fries were old and refried,3
Its not bad!! They made my burger perfect when i took it out of the box lol,3
Chicken nuggets and fries are very tasty but felt horrible rest of the day and next day too...probably all the fillers and stuff...,3
They have a fireplace that they never use so it's always freezing. Maybe put some heat on.,3
If they got my order correct I'd be shocked.,3
"The one complaint is the put food in a bag that is too small to close, food gets cold quickly.",3
"Lady was very helpful and polite, food was ok",3
Made me wait in the annoying end of the sidewalk spot only to give me cold food and a watered down iced coffee,3
Good food but really long wait,3
Breakfast is the best meal of the day. Pancakes are good.,3
Service was slow and they made my order wrong :(,3
"Slow for fast food
And milk shake machine is always down",3
Food isn't cooked and very slow,3
"It is fast food, what is there to say?",3
Hashbrowns were super fresh.,3
What can I really say about Mickey D,3
Slow service in drive thru...,3
it's fine,3

Was a little slow in the drive trough,3
The food was not that great,3
Stop by eat then leave!,3
The shake machine is never working.,3
"Very quick, and delicious",3
Easy clean and convenient,3
Same as any other McDonald's,3
Great service and friendly,3

Ordered a steak bagel during breakfast through drive-thru. I had a very long wait. The bagel was good and was as expected from a McDonald's. My experience having to wait a while is about 50/50 at this location.,3
Just recent some girl was in lobby while kids went crazy in lobby .She came with purpose but as an older person made me feel good asking them please to calm a bit spread out they moved belongings closer not all over cleaned Think name was stacie I saw . After school gets crowded good to see someone proud to help along with guard who seems busy at time .all over great service for busy place.,3
Going off uber eats order. Orders a large meal..no fries or mac sauce that I paid extra for. Called twice goes to voice-mail.,3
"It is really clean, employee Joel keeps it super clean in the morning shift. But they never seem to get the order right. Then I have to go back and get it corrected. Like it be clear on the receipt and they still mess it up! The staff overall is professional and nice.",3
"The food tasted fresh. I asked for mac sauce on my burger, but instead, I got a bunch of ketchup.",3
Cops had to show up.. group of kids  being super loud. Don't know if there was a fight ... almost $3 for a plain  burger that use to be $1,3
"Took over 45 minutes at the drive through, so long at 9pm on a Sunday,  doors locked, uber, grubhub walking up to the drive though in front of cars waiting over 45 minutes.

Other days, they are usually fine, so I am going to think this was just an understaffed night.",3
"Came in to get 2 iced coffee and some chicken nuggets. The Manager of the day was lousy and gave our nuggets to someone else and blamed the employee. Speaking of, the employee helping us was fantastic. Offered to give us free coffee when we werent able to use our points to  redeem our second coffee, and defended us from the manager when we were being blamed for not getting the nuggets when we were still ",3
It,3
Long wait for the food but the order was right and the ice cream machine worked,3
"I know it was just a McDonalds, but there are clean ones too where staffs regularly c",3
"4 days ago, 8 o'clock hour (am), I Asked for a sausage biscuit with cheese... Got a sausage and egg on a biscuit. I was clear when ordering, because I had to repeat myself to the manager who had to assist the cashier that was servicing me, what I wanted. Nonetheless, I get change back, leave and I leave with a sausage biscuit... ""I actually told YOU when you came to help her"". Then receiving my sandwich and saw it was the wrong one, STILL!!! Joke's on me for thinking I had the last laugh but I just might with this review ",3
Drive through employee's are not customer service friendly. Most of them just take your money and give your order without any aknowledgement and with attitude. What ever happened to Welcome to McDonald's can I take your order please? Thank you and Have a nice day?,3
"It's a McDonald's...
What do you want me to say? Bathroom was clean, service had a minimal amount of angst and my order was correct and prompt...

They probably deserve a higher minimum wage.",3
"Being remodeled. We stopped for a quick fast food and were advised they will be closing in a few days for 2 months remodeling. I cant wait until then because this is the only local McDs around here and will be missed during renovation. See ya soon. 2 months, like around November 2019 will revisit and rate.",3
There used to be a play place and after recent construction I was taken away. No need to bring your children here anymore.,3
"The staff is horrible, I have a problem almost every time I go and it's always the staff. Especially the managers.",3
"This place is great,  you could order anything EXCEPT Milkshake. Everytime i order milkshake for my friend at whatever hour, it always, ALWAYS breaks down and they ask me if i wanted something else. I'm like...... "" No, my friend is looking forward to that "" But i had a feeling something like this is gonna happen. I just wish if the manager can order a repair on their machine. It's getting a bit ridiculous for something like this to happen everytime i order. So no, I'm not happy.",3
"The food is okay when you're on the run. But I just walked into the men's room and had to run out. For an establishment that maintains a healthy profit, they absolutely need to update their 19th Century restroom accommodations. And come up with a maintenance schedule.",3
"I'm here with my children to enjoy the indoor play area. However,  there is a manager male with earnings in both ears (for identification purpose only) who is extremely rude to the employees in front of customers.
He definitely need some business advice and a lot of common sense.  My 9 year old wanted to know why he is so upset at everyone. Whoever you are, please don't ruin your customers mood. I'm compelled to post this. Sad.",3
They renovated this place for no reason. The staff forgot things in my order and not to mention that I had to wait long for simple stuff while people who came after me got their food and left. They gave my daughters the wrong toy and forgot food items.,3
"The service was fast, maybe a little to fast. They didn",3
I order from grubhub here regularly today Iam absolutely shocked that there was a Large Coca Cola drink missing from my Double QP Meal. Iam absolutely Shocked and surprised at how Dumb these McDonald's employees can be if you Fail to Put a Drink In a Combo meal Order you should definitely not be working in Fast Food you need help and Iam absolutely stunned at this whoever prepared my meal today and Failed to put my Large Coke definitely has the mindset of a Medieval Wagon Donkey.,3
"Standard McDonalds, staff does not care and does not give you the time of day. If you are in a rush you may want to think of something else to eat as it takes forever, even if you go through drive through. If you ask for extra sauce (any more than 2) expect to pay additional charges.",3
"staff were very nice, got my order right however the people that are usually in there are just so obnoxious, you're probably better off eating outside or taking it to go",3
They have rude staff and slow service. I have anxiety and this place just triggers my nerves. Overall food is as regular as it can be I guess. Forgot the sauce or forgot the straw kind of service.,3
"I almost always use the drive-thru and English is my first language and I'm born in New York City. That being said, numerous times I have been unable to understand the other person in the booth and they cannot understand me. Sometimes it is faulty intercom issues itself. But, often it is someone in the booth who does not understand or speak English properly! This is highly frustrating when I have to repeat my order as much as six times! Yeah, I said six times! Last weekend,  it was an Indian kid  who I could not for the life of me understand! And he could not understand me. A polite enough kid when I reached the booth, but seriously frustrating experience! Other times it's someone who does speak the language properly, or a close facsimile LOL but they are distracted by their phone. When I finally reach the booth to pay, often, and usually female LOL, the cashier is thumbing through her phone. McDonald's needs to set some standards for the people who work the drive thru. If you are face to face with a cashier with language issues, it's easier to deal with, but, Don't put these people on the Drive through intercom! By the way the food is just fine there. No issues on that end. LOL, work it out Mickey d!",3
Lots of noisy kids. Maybe because of the play place. Food is ok. Nothing worth coming back to!,3
This location is supposed to be closing in August for major construction and it will be replaced with a new McDonalds. This was my go-to McDonalds when I went to Queens College and I still come here on occasion. I will miss it for sentimental reasons and the staff here is usually friendly and not bad to look at. Hope it reopens soon.,3
"The McDonald okay. Got my orders right. Go there for breakfast and dinner. Cant stand troublesome kids that hang in there sometimes, but it is not the  restaurants fault.",3
"It's McDonalds. Outdated. Needs a makeover. However, it's still McDonalds. We still go. Service is generally busy and rushed. Parking is plentiful on both sides. Food is okay, neither bad nor great.",3
"Newitem rib bread not so goodbread small and no vegetable and source too much
I Hope have some",3
"Staff is ok, and the order is a hit and miss. The food is just ok. I had better from them.",3
This place is severely understaffed. I hope upper management sees this and doesn't punish the workers instead of actually fixing the problem.,3
Forced to use kiosk to order even when lobby is empty.  Took awhile to get ice cream cones.  Clean.,3
Food was good but they messed up our order,3
Workers walk around doing nothing while customers are lining by the numbers. Also they Skip people if some One they know come in that's totally unfair when I've been online for 35 minutes,3
I only use the drive thru here. They never give you a receipt unless you ask.,3
Food is great as always you can never go wrong with McDonald's but the bathrooms and the playground were not that clean in this location !!!!,3
Not friendly staff. Always have a wrong order,3
they need to do something about the sprinklers next to the ordering board customers get wet while ordering beside that love the service,3
"They are ok, they just need to get more organized, and need to have a better attitude.",3
"Busy place, management need to make sure they clean their dining area more ofen.",3
"It's a loud McDonald's, staff is ok. I always use drive thru, don't like to stay there too much noise.",3
"This McDonald's is ok compared to other locations  , definitely in need of a modern renovation,  limited seating and full of old people hanging out",3
"Food was fine, but they got part of my order wrong twice. However, they were responsive in correcting the matter.",3
Areas are generally clean and the staff are good natured.,3
"It was the end of the school day, alot of teenagers chasing each other through the place, s reaming yelling bumping into people acting like thugs. Management did nothing",3
8 times out of 10 there will be missing something from your order when going through drive thru,3
Just okay the place was clean but the attendant wants to me to order from the kiosk and I wanted to be a real person and talk to a real person at a register she would not let me send it was not a good experience,3
"Well-maintained location, however, order fulfillments are not swift/timely.",3
"Charged me for one thing and I recived another, because the cashier was rushing...not nice. The food as usual.",3
Used to be a great McDonald's but since they rebuilt it hasn't been the same.,3
They can never get your order right.,3
Good parking lot but seems like they are short with staff as it's dirty inside with garbage container fully loaded,3
It's a McDonald's no more no less.  They are polite and quick,3
Typical McDonald's. Parking lot and drive thru not well-planned. Good bathrooms...,3
Unless it's the afternoon staff service is horrible. Always screwing up my orders.,3
Sometimes slow in the drive in all prices went up,3
Service is good and restaurant and bathroom  are Clean. Some items are really good,3
Wait is too long good cheap food friendly staff,3
Could be better with some deals as holiday season is here,3
Ordered Large fries no salt was added,3
Sometimes it hard to use WiFi in McDonald. That mean you can not use coupons to purchase.,3
"Every single time I came here they always mess something up, then I have to waste time and rejoin the drive through line.",3
Newly renovated with new crew under going different customer style so a little chaotic.,3
lines go quickly and it has two drive through,3
Service is bad. I asked sauce they didn't gave to  me...,3
"The restroom was not clean, utensils are not in outside,  u have to ask them to get it",3

Its maccers and its open 24 hours. Gets you out of a pickle if you are hungry,3
Food gets worse and worse as the years go by.,3
Hours for very it's best to go inside in order,3
"Its ok, only 3 because a/c never works.",3
The service has gotten much better.,3
Majority of the workers don't speak English and the ones that do are mad rude,3
"Usually crowded, nice staff. Place needs an update.",3
Good,3
"Good on most days,  not very friendly",3
Drive thru service took a long time,3
Higher prices than other McDonald's,3
Only go in for the chicken nuggets an DC unsweetened tea with Splenda.,3
Staff was not responsive No condiments supplied,3
Always busy and over crowded with middle school and high school students at lunch and after school.,3
It's okay not bad,3
Fries are always less in the box,3

"Visited this location for breakfast. The place is very small, better for take out. Ordering is easy on the screen. The waiting time is considerably ok based on the high volume of clients they serve, however I do recommend to check your order at the time receiving it in the counter. I didn't have any inconvenience, probably because I only order a coffee, but 5 min waiting time were enough to see several clients complaining for a missing item. I think I waited too much for a coffee, but I understand they were really busy. The coffee was good as usual.",3
"Too many thugs and homeless nearby and bit slow for fast food but that might be due to busy orders. The fries definitely need some more salts, eating no raw fries are just horrible",3
Pretty average for mcdonalds in the city. Convenient location by penn station. Limited sitting.,3
The workers need hair nets and gloves.,3
"It's a McDonald's, simple and relatively efficient at getting out food. You're not coming here for service, you're coming here for some classic fast food.",3
"Food took longer than I'd expect at a fast food restaurant, and they have surprisingly little seating space upstairs given the busy location of the restaurant.

It looked like they had another level of seating but it was closed off for some reason.",3
The food was okay. The burger was not that warm and the cheese didn't really melt.  They also forgot to give us a burger and some of the sauce. The table locaters were empty so we had to wait at the desk. The tables and seats were clean so that was good.,3
"Although the food was fresh, due to COVID the is no internal seating. You can't even stand  and eat. So get your food and be gone! Not a good place if you want a quick bite and a short rest.",3
"The food here is always great and on point, however the person on handing off and making fries showed frustration and attitude tonight.",3
I don't do McDonald's a lot but this place was okay. They need to stay on the cleanliness and the dining room. Also check the calibration of the sodas constantly because the Sprite tasted like seltzer. They fixed it while I was there though.,3
"Not everything is offered at this location since I believe it's an ""express"" of sorts. Straight away, you will notice how crowded this place is since it's a pretty narrow space. Once orders are put in, you never really know where to stand to wait for your food. The staff are nice enough though and the time your food takes to come out can vary widely. There is additional seating upstairs which I personally have not been to and this seems more like a hot spot to just order takeout anyway.",3
"The place is kept clean and its ""
Just your basic ""mickey d""s"". If youre so inclined theres more to this location other than burgers and fries...huge homeless population...caution is also on the menu. Its free.",3
Place was clean and nice.....service was fast.,3
"With today's day and age a change will come quoted from a great leader, troubles you might face turn your head to it. New place but remember I haven't did any thing you didn't want already happened, coffee and cookie any one they got meals too. And of course fast service, I hope.",3
"Good but credit card machines broken, lack of ketchup or napkins in my to go bag and lack of seating.   Coffee was NOT hot or made by more order specs.  15/hr.....they should step up they're game.",3
"I love me some McDonald's, but I was saddened with how cold my food was... & you know you can't just throw fastfood frenchfries in the microwave or oven. THEY WERE BUSY TOO- so you would think everything was coming out hot. Sadly, that was not the case. My double-quarterpounder, fries & 4 piece chicken nuggets were all BARELY luke warm.",3
"Customer service was pretty good, fast professional & efficient!! As for the breakfast order I made.. it left MUCH to be desired. It was a value meal with bagel, egg, cheese, coffee & hash brown. The bagel with egg would've been fine alone.. What ruined it for me was the 2 layers on the sandwich of what was supposed to be the  ""cheese"".. it was vile!! The ""cheese"" tasted like Cheez Wiz which I TOTALLY despise. To salvage as much of the sandwich as I could.. I scraped off the ""cheese"".",3
The early morning staff is very courteous.  My big complaint is the non payors that come in and decide the downstairs seating area should be their sleeping space and a place where they should put all their belongings on.,3
Its good if you like a McDonald's burger.,3
Went there two days in a row. First day tried using the mcdonald's deals. There wasn't a scanner so worker had to type it in. Said that the deal was only for a free small soft drink and not a small orange juice.  It states what's free in the app. Went back today and used a kiosk. Scanner deal from my phone and the thing froze. This place seems not to except deals at all shame.,3
Fast but not fast enough to get the homeless out,3
"The meal was as good as Mc Donald's can prepare. The store though , being located across the street from Penn Station one would expect a store size suitable for travelers with bags. This was not the case and the wifi was non existent.",3
Fast. Service,3
I had to wait 20 minutes for a singular order of fries.,3
Fast service always very busy sitting areas are always packed,3
"Extremely slow, store was relatively clean thou, but can't understand why they kept skiping orders and took like 20 mins to prepare a slushy, ah don't forget to ask for napkins, they don't give them and takes forever to attend you if you go back to ask for them",3
"Waited too long for a regular order, if I didn't check, smoothies not in the bag, store is unorganized!",3
Very nice place but homeless people outside. And takes long to get your order. All I got was two Sundays.,3
Slow service. Staff member was on there phone while working. Food was good quality.,3
It was delicious but I just wish they'd allow us to sit down and enjoy our meal,3
Very busy location. Doing thier best to serve a crowd. Food was good. Seating was full.,3
"Minimal seating. Staff isn't fond of you and just want to get over with their shift. Pretty dirty. Just any other NYC McDonald's, don't expect much",3
It's okay service is decent could be better,3
It's McDonald's they are the same everywhere so you know what to expect. Extremely fast service. Okay food. Avoid the bathrooms they are terrible!,3
"Terrible system & they left the bag over on tbe side & never came to ask who order belonged to, i finally sent my Grandson to go check. Food was cold. Not happy",3
I love the bacon egg and cheese as well as other options on the menu. ,3
Food was ok. Ordered take out & they forgot one sandwich but they corrected the mistake with no problem,3
Staff could care less if you have everything you need to enjoy your meal.,3
Clean and fast. Crowded and no real place to sit down at. Very rushed feeling there.,3
"Just a regular macdonald, the bathroom was kinda clean tho",3
I received the smallest amount of ice Cream in my mc flurry.......and also the employees were arguing while listening to their customers.,3
My friend didnt g,3
Okay experience. Nothing memorable,3
service was ok but the drink was tasteless and it supposed to be sweet tea,3
Was quite slow,3
Cold fries and bums outside that curse you for not giving money. Seating area very clean and kept.,3
Fast and easy if you are in a rush and hungry now ,3
Harrowing experience on my last visit as a customer jumped over the counter to steal food and/or assault the employees?,3
"Another MCDonals, usually you can get a seat. The bathrooms are fine.",3
"Could be cleaner and even though we stayed there to eat, food came in a bag.",3
Wish all the people that seats there are customers.  It makes it hard to eat in,3
"Few deals, like everywhere in McDonald's..help, no matter is lousy",3
Only customer yet ten min wait for regular coffee,3
Where you place your food order at is not enough waiting space.,3
Standard McDonald's,3
"It was nice, small but kinda clean",3
Food is too grease not much on the $1 menu.,3
Only good when you have coupons,3
A place to eat,3
The staff weren't very helpful or friendly.,3
Always crowded. Inadequate seating.,3
I want my burger before 11. Please make that happen,3
Be ready to stand most of the time when you take dine in,3
They forgot my cranberry orange crossaint,3
The service was not fast in the morning,3
Ok food. Noisy childish crowd.,3
A nut house ,3
Its a McDonald's. What else is there to say about it?,3
"Tiny place, nowhere to get straws, napkins etc",3
Clean and fast moving services,3
"Its McDonalds, what more do you expect",3
Same fare as any Mickey D's,3
"OK, but service is slow.",3
Good food and good service,3

It's McDonald's ,3
"The hall is closed, there is nowhere to sit. Although most places have already canceled these restrictions.

I had to wait a super long time for the order, and, as always, I didn",3
"In general, all McDonald's are the same, these ones here in NY have been very crowded lately and there is usually no space to sit at peak hours. But they are still the best option to eat for the prices of the combos.",3
Option for a quick snack for those who don't miss the opportunity to breathe the air of Times Square at dawn. This branch is just a few minutes' walk away.,3
"Long waiting time, tastier food and a larger selection than at McDonald's in the Czech Republic.
Super atmosphere. Thanks",3
"We ordered a hamburger and fries. The plain vanilla ice cream for about $2. The food was average and below.
The place itself is clean, cozy, there are 2 upper floors for sitting.",3
"Food was not really tasty, few seats. We received food in a bag, regardless of whether we came to collect or not.",3
"It is not working 100% but because it is fast food, it is convenient to buy and continue on the road without wasting much time. Sometimes the attention is not as friendly as it should be, and at night after 11:00 p.m. there is no ice to prepare certain drinks, it is something to improve",3
"It has improved a lot but they are always missing something... wait what too, shop at the end of the world!",3
I went there after New Year's Eve countdown in New York. Americans eat hamburgers after parties like Japanese people eat ramen. I know that feeling. Thank you for being open despite the late night of the end of the year!,3
Normal Mac Donald's. We tried table service but they got our order wrong. Nothing special,3
How the warmth has deteriorated in this chain,3
Most fat.,3
A lot of people! Correct service. Bathrooms with very long lines,3
"Standard McDonald. There are kiosks for self-order. A LOT OF PEOPLE, constant queues. Some positions are missing.",3
Good prices at this branch,3
Central location. Many people. A lot of mess,3
It is. Mui. Clean the. Very person. Kind,3
Little space available for meals,3
Snack ever! very few options,3
It is not very clean on the tables,3
Good attention but little space,3
Quite expensive compared to the many competition,3
I practice for a craving.,3
"Open 7/7

"The Big Mac patty was perfectly dry with no flavor, just right for the drunk folks with taste buds vanished long ago in the weekend festivities. The staff was accommodating and friendly allowing us to use the bathroom. Kindness goes a long way.",3
"It's a hit or miss with McDonald's location. At times you can recieved a good customer service and wait a long while to get your food. When you finally get your food from waiting so long (this is when it's not busy), the food is not assembled properly or it's over cooked almost border line burnt. If you wanted coffee from this location, major of the staff cant make good coffee. I often look for a particular employee that makes it the best. On the other hand, this location is one of the most cleanest locations I've ever been in. Management does a good job making sure everything is clean and ready for business. Every time I come in their always cleaning the deep fryer, counters, refilling the machines and all, despite all the college kids and tourists wreaking the joint. They do pick up the place in high traffic and complete orders in a timely manner with sacrifice to customer experience. I would love to see more pride in the making of the order look close to the photo and consistency with delivering good customer service.",3
"Was asked to buy food in order to use the electrical plugs, turned out they weren't working",3
"Was there about 2 months ago. Ordered a burger and fries. Fries werent too bad but they messed up my burger. I just wanted a plain burger, they loaded it up with things. They let me exchange it which was nice. The other thing that I didn",3
Frequently drama filled. Staff can be disorganized and arguing amongst themselves in front of customers. Homeless and users are common. General stop for tourists to use the bathroom. Access to reasonably priced items relatively quickly makes it worthwhile for a quick visit.,3
Clean! The fries ,3
"The food is predictably reliable, as it is part of the McDonald's NY franchise.  Automated ordering and paying with a pick up counter puts this one up-to-date.  But the clientele here may be a little... wilder than some other locations, and at this one, the single bathroom was unsanitary and had no working lock!  Ugh...",3
I had the fries and coffee. They were good.,3
It's fine. I love the seat setup. I just don't understand why the upstairs is always closed. This is one of those places that usually has ice cream,3
My food was delicious but they did mess up my order. The bathroom was so nasty and there is nowhere to put your stuff while you hover over the piss covered seat.,3
The usual steady consistency in their coffee and brew fresh when asked. Its not the best but brew fresh and stronger than DD any day,3
I don't think I will be going to the 1st Ave and 14th street location any time soon.  Too many people just sitting around occupying space without ordering and I saw individuals walk in and  walk up to the sofa machine with their own cup and serve themselves soda and walk out. One guy came in with a bag from KFC containing 2 buckets and 4 boxes with a cup and take soda from the machine and walk out.  Crazy,3
This place was okay it wasn't crowded and the food was very fresh is nice quiet place to sit and eat,3
It's a McDonald's. Nothing amazing. Wasn't too clean but I gave it 3 cuz my vanilla shake was made quickly and tasted better than normal.,3
"Not the best McDonald's
Out of stock on alot of items",3
"Service is okay -- not the fastest but not the slowest. Seating is limited. They have a bizarre sign ""no loitering - 30min max"".",3
At this location you have to wait a long time for your food it's usually cold and I'll sign the garbage cans are so full no one empties them out don't like that,3
Traditional run of the mill McDonalds. The food and staff and everything was what I expected of a McDonalds. I'm not personally a huge fan of McDonalds but if you are this place would be great I imagine. Also don't forget to use their app they have so many great coupons and offers on it so you can get free stuff.,3
Staff was very fast the French Fry's needed more salt,3
It's ok. I mean... u get your food fast and you get out faster,3
Tough neighborhood! Lol Who would think one could get shot at Union Square!? ,3
"Decor is great, but it's dirty. Gets a lot of homeless and druggie types hanging out.",3
The best thing about Mac Donald's while wandering in NY is that you can use their bathrooms. And get a coffee  for a good price,3
It is a small McDonalds in Manhattan. Not very crowded. The staff is grumpy. The food is what you can expect at McDonalds.,3
A homeless guy asked me for money to get something to eat. I told him I would buy him something and he asked me for McDonald's. Seems to be the customer base here.,3
"It's McDonald's, there is a bathroom for customers. Not sure what else I can say.",3
"Had to ask to have the table cleaned.
Pan handles nearby, unfortunately.
Prices and food were the usual.",3
One of the cashiers was given tho much attitude and didn't have patience for the customer/s to get the coupon,3
"This location is not open 24 hrs as indicated, closes around 11pm",3
What more do expect from a fast food restaurant.,3
It was alright. Service could be faster.,3
About what one would expect from a McDonald's ,3
Kinda dirty but super friendly service.,3
Nice McDonalds but the problem is all the junkies and high school kids be in there fighting and hanging out  I really feel bad for security and the staff,3
Okay today,3
Good quick service and plenty of seating.,3
It's the city... It's always packed and always there's interesting people here,3
Never overly crowded. Service is decently quick.,3
Very crowded during the afternoon I recommend going towards night,3
This McDonalds was sort of like purgatory. Lost souls all over the place.,3
"Quality tends to be hit or miss, and this location has gotten rather pricey.",3
"As the previous reviews have pointed out, this McDonald's seems to also be a homeless shelter.",3
They could clean the tables a bit more ofte5,3
Milkshake are so much better then the uk,3
The personal is not kind. The food is alright.,3
Store was dirty and the staff were pushy.,3
Nice location. Decent service.,3
Always being harassed by security and beggers there can't eat in peace,3
Ok breakfast skip biscuits tasted old,3
Standard fare.  Better after the renovation.,3
"It's McDonald's, for when you need those 1 am french fries.",3
"Good service, no refill...",3
Need more people working service to slow.,3
"Fast, clean good service.",3
Dirty restroom slow service,3
McDonald's has really cheap good coffee!!!,3
Very poor service and untidy.,3
It has 24 hour Breakfast.,3

Mediocre quality. Often chaotic.,3
Furniture needs to be replaced urgently.,3
"It was ok ,kitchen was dirty",3
Fries could use more salt,3
Another McDonald's. Just good when you have no other choice.,3
A very average urban McDonald,3

"With how expensive everything is, everything is already long since I didn't eat a hamburger with chips",3
"Better place than others, I just asked for a soda.",3
For a fast food place the service is slow.,3
"The rating is acceptable ... But it's quite decent considering that this is the center of New York and you won't find cheaper food than in Mac. Actually, there is nothing to look forward to.",3
General cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired.,3
"The attention of the cashiers is not very good, that's why I don't give it 4 ",3
"Efficient service, but dirty bathroom and noisy clientele. Good point for a break",3
Same as those found in France. Okay,3
"I prefer Brazil! There's cat shup at will, tastier burger!",3
"Like any other in the franchise, only this one has Coca-Cola of many flavors, each one more disgusting",3
"There are always a lot of people who sit for hours and like to listen loudly to music and some other crap, not letting them have a normal bite to eat ..",3
Poor cleaning place. A single bathroom and in poor condition.,3
Convenient. Cheap. But still not a fan,3
For in McDo in the US this one is premium,3
Products always in line with the company,3

"For a McDonald's, this location isn't bad. It's renovated with artistic walls that creates a more inviting atmosphere. When I went on a Monday evening, the space was clean with plenty of corners to sit. Service was a bit more friendly and faster than expected.",3
"Pretty decent McDonalds to get decently priced food in the heart of Lower East Side. The interior is super spacious, there are kiosks built into the walls, and the bathroom was super clean. Unfortunately, they closed the second floor for reasons unknown. It was also super busy when I went (Friday Night) so the orders took an extremely long amount of time to prepare (over 15-20 minutes).",3
"Not much for expectations when you enter any NYC McDonalds. This one is aesthetically pleasing, having recently been updated. Clutch location for fast food anytime.",3
Driest English muffin ever. They never suggest a deal.,3
What you expect fast food period! Nothing else.,3
"Good Old McDonald's at their best as usual. Unfortunately timing is everything. Took me 20 minutes from the time I ordered my food to get my order. I couldn't figure out how they could be so crowded without even a place to sit down. Unless they all had a terrible time at the cash register which kept in there after ordering. I've been to this McDonald's before, it's been slow before. But nothing like today. terribly disappointing. My first five minutes I was with an inexperienced cashier. So I can't blame her. Before the manager to take another 15 minutes ridiculous.",3
"Too many cars driving thru, traffic mess almost always, I park in 99 Ranch Market/Target parking lot. No kids play area, and outside seating RIGHT next to Drive-Thru, no plants or buffer wall/separation. Only minimal indoor dining. Not best of fast food places to go, many other ones nearby.",3
"Customer service needs more training.  Girl (I said girl, I meant child), looked frightened to be there.  Good news - I ordered 2 lg Frappes and they gave me a punch card to get a free one after buying so many.  Only McDonald's I've been to with them.  So good job!  And girlfriend, practice makes perfect, put yourself out there!",3
Be careful parking on the south side of the building during busy hours because the cars in the drive thru will block you in. It's very tight.,3
"Went through drive-thru. McGriddles were hot, hashbrowns were cold, orange juice was room temperature.

LEO GETZ WAS RIGHT!
DON'T GO TO THE DRIVE-THRU!",3
"Mcdonalds new blueberry pie is dope, not gonna lie..",3
"The restaurant is actually usually very clean and nice. However, I'm giving only 3 due to its setup to serve drive thru customers and not walk-in guests equally. While seating is usually available and clean, it is very limited inside (there's also limited seating outdoors).",3
"The employees are friendly, but it takes too long to place your order and then get your food.",3
"The fries were soggy even after I had requested fresh fries. They always forget something, so check your bag before u pull away",3
"Food ok

Employees at the drive thru
Should all be fired.

They no nothing about people
Skills or customer service...

I wont go back

Keeps happening to me...",3
They messed up my order and I only ordered 3 small burgers. But I called and one of the managers said she will fix it for me. Food was good no line at the time I went,3
Wish they had vegan options. We have to go to another place for a vegan burger.,3
The nuggets had a nasty after taste. The Big Mac was good,3
"Service has always been friendly. Traffic flow isn't great during a rush. It's a very small store, with homeless hanging out around it quite often. Needs a remodel.",3
75% workers speak Spanish only so you can't customize orders because they don't speak English,3
"The ordering machine messed up our orders, we wanted a plain cheese burger and a normal one and it didn't show on their screen the plain one while they were cooking it",3
"This is not a full features McDonald's. Most of the service at this McDonald's comes through the drive through, and there are only a couple of tables inside.",3
Last 4 visit I went to two different McDonald order shank still not working.,3
Kinda bummed they got rid of a lot of their chicken options. No grilled or any salads of any kind.,3
Super slow.,3
"Your average McDonald's. They kept it clean, and it's a good area of town. Very quiet.",3
So far no food poisoning. There's a random man who comes at around night time and sometimes tries to talk to you.,3
Smallish restaurant. Fast service. Have kiosks. No play area. Outdoor seating available.,3
Order was wrong. Took forever to get one item remade.,3
They don't serve breakfast all day. Very disappointing.,3
Fries were reheated. The guy who took order messed it up but staff overall was very nice,3
"It's inexpensive fast food, but it tastes reasonably good.",3
"Small venue,  smaller than usual menu. Had the feeling of a food court version of the restaurant but in a major shopping center.",3
Chicken mc griddle were so good,3

"It'd McDonalds. It is what it is as far as the food and atmosphere go. The staff here does make a difference. They are all friendly, accommodating and always smiling. Makes for a more pleasant experience than many other fast food places.",4
"I'm not really a huge fan of fast food, but I have 2 teenage daughter's who enjoy McDs. The staff here is always friendly and ALWAYS get their orders correct. By far one of the best McDs I have ever been to. I always enjoy and appreciate quality service from quality people... and you'll definitely find it here. At least from the evening crew. Haven't been here during the day. My girls joke that I go here so often to get them food, that the staff is going to end up knowing me and having their order ready to go. Lmao Great people and excellent service. ",4
"The line wS extremely big and was moving very slowly, plus they were out of apple pies and strawberry cream pies, but they gave me substitute cinnabun, the staff was very apologetic for being slow & they were out of pies, but it was middle of the night and they were extremely under-staffed.",4
The staff seems to always be different which makes ordering sometimes a little difficult because they are in a state of perpetual learning which can also lead to waiting a bit longer but the lobby is always clean as well as the bathrooms,4
With all the new upgrades everything looks great and clean great staff,4
Good quick drive through service.  Was a long line but went very quickly.,4
I go here all the time. Great staff.. NVR get my food wrong it's just always a line wrapped around lol that's why they ain't 5. Most def customer service is better then the food but hey I just go for my kids because they love it so why not! Good customer service guys! Makes all the difference,4
"OPEN 24HRS all the darn time!!  If there are 24 hours in every day and then 7 days in a week then that means this place is open eleventeen million hours a year.  I dont even know how they find people to work here I mean how do they shower or brush their teeth or change clothes if they are always there.... I think I may have an idea: they are robots.  Or clones, like this example that's Dolly the sheep she's pretty hot NGL.",4
"It was late, order was wrong, person taking order needs to slow down,",4
"Service is slow, but I get all of my items with no errors and it's a bit smaller than most locations. Overall, it's a good place to grab a quick bite near Lake Creek.",4
Manager waited on me. He went out of his way to make me a satisfied customer.  Great customer service!,4
"I would have given 5, the evening manager is the nicest person I have seen and is definitely in charge of training her crew with constantly new help, in spite of this, everytime I have to return an order she goes back to the kitchen and patiently disassembles the sandwich and explains the proper way to make the sandwich in a spirit of education and with a cherry disposition. You can tell the children she works with respect her and look up to her, and yes, they might get things confused occasionally but I will continue to go there. 4 out of 5",4
"The staff is very kind and the food is usually prepared in a timely manner, for this reason it'sone of my preferred location's. However the drive thru line can sometimes be an inconvenience as it can get very long and at times even block entrances.",4
Mcdonalds is great but they really need to hire people who understand both english and spanish and not just spanish speakers trying to take english orders. The people are really nice but be smarter about who you put in the drive thru and lobby to take orders.,4
Food was good atmosphere was ok restaurant was clean. Only thing from making it a 5 I almost ate it on the floor. Wet sign was present but it was beyond slick. Otherwise good quick place to grab a bite.,4
"EDIT: Recently this McDonald's had been improving a lot, especial when compared to other McDonald's in the area (maybe the one on North part of W. Parmer, but not really fair comparison, I mean That one has a god-damn waterfall....). Keep up the good work! +1 Star

OLD: They took out all the power outlets and a table was just left broken covered with caution tape. Always understaffed and you can tell the owners are sucking this place for every penny without putting anything back in. Gives family owned McDonald's a bad name.",4
"Look, it is good food for the money. It is fast food people, but I will rather go to McDonald's than all the other fast food burger places. Fries are off the chain everytime, honestly.
Craving one as we speak!",4
Live nearby and this is our choice McDonald's compared to others in close distance. I gotta say though that the last order of fries I got really were so yucky I chewed on 2 and didnt eat the rest. They tasted over cooked or double cooked. Something made them rubbery and inedible to me.,4
"This store has a friendly smiling staff. It is clean. And most of the time the orders are correct and when they aren't the management makes it right. Convenient, easy, quick.",4
"As part of Lake Creek Festival Mall review McDonald's is featured as a member of the Mall and as Contributing Member of Our Anderson Mill Community.

Peace ",4
"There service was good, but don't order a med water they charge.I ask and she said anything bigger than a small they do charge,  well all they had to do is tell me before I pay and give me a choice!",4
Go everyday for my morning breakfast before work. Staff is nice and if I ever had a error with my to go order the manager has made it right.,4
"Still the best unhealthy cheapest breakfast in town. The $1 coffee is a steal. And yes, we all deserve a break every once in a while.",4

"Never had any issues inside, always had amazing service and friendly staff ",4

Quick and convenient... Fast food is fast food. Great if quality is expected to be mediocre,4
Quick and ordera always come out right,4

"Not worth the effort to get in and out of construction to wait for old food.
Only went there twice. The food is never fresh.  Chicken sandwich was shriveled and dry like it had been sitting for hours after being over cooked to begin with. There was a small drop of mayo on it and the bun was stale. First time I figured was a one off but the second time I ordered 20 nuggets and fries and a milkshake.  They didn't give a receipt then told me to go park to wait for the food to be ready.  There were no spots open that I could access and the cashier just said 'do whatever' and walked away.  I waited for the car in front of me to move so I could pull around the building and get into a spot but asked first about my shake.  She said they'll bring it.  Waited a few min honestly not long but then they forgot my milkshake and asked me very curtly 'well do you have a receipt? ' clearly not.  Eventually they brought out the shake but fries were old and cold and the shake was melted.",4
Very clean and polite people here. They did mix up my pie order but was refunded .,4
"Haven't ate McDonald's in 3 years, got a breakfast sandwich and I must say thanks for switching the egg and the crispy bacon, they listened to me and did what I wanted! I'm impressed.",4
"The most recent time was great! Fries were hot n crispy. I gave 4 instead of 5 because I'm still thinking about the Time before last, the fries were cold right out the gate.",4
Quick bit fare price come by,4
"Nice, clean, and friendly. The cashier was knowledgeable and patient especially when people could not make up their minds on their food choices.  The food seems better than most McDonald's but not by much.",4
"This is our hometown MCdonalds and between the wife, grandchildren and I we are here twice a week.  Like review I did on the Hamlin MCDonalds, I call this the older style and it's been [ainted over the years and they removed the small playyard it had.  People now are a afraid of ballpits and it was outside so it didn't get used over 6 months of the year.

There is ample seating, but I've seen more with more seating, but we've never been without finding a seat.  Everything is pretty clean and in good order. Walk-in orders are accurate and fast.  Drive in is fast and about 8 times out of 10 they will have it exact.  Some times they get it wrong, but like we say nobody's perfect.

Since it's right on Rt209 it's easy to get in and out of unless your traveling South on 209 then sometimes it's hard to pull out because there's KFC and Subway and an Ice Cream shop across the street so it's a busy little area in Brodheadsville.  Overall it's a nice facility.",4
"Wind Gap, PA location was surprisingly better during COVID 19 because with the interior closed, the drive up was fast and serving fresh food.
The streamlined way allows  serving just the drive up and so, the kitchen staff cooks food for just one area. Probably saves on staff hours.
Just crave those FRIES once in awhile.",4
"Got the 20 peice mc chicken nuggets and a large fry. The nuggets we're fine, but the Fry's we're stale and that made me sad. The fries can be the best part of the meal. I know that I could have and should have returned them... But I didn't.",4
"Always consistantly good food at a good price. I like the breakfast choices. The fries are the best of any fast food restaurant period. I've read articles, how they selectively choose and then sign contracts with potato farmers to insure the quality and taste is maintained throught all the locations. I wish they would deep fry the apple pies as they did years ago, they were the best when fried. Good service, always have the food choices in stock. clean seating area, kitchen, and bathrooms Enjoy.",4
Nice to sit inside after 2years. The tables didn't look sanitized after people had eaten  I could see grease and crumbs left behind  Also very disappointed they have no salads,4
I went through the drive-through or two chicken nuggets and a root beer with no ice the chicken nuggets with ice cold and the rupiah had a double lid on it and when I drink it spilled about a third of it on my shirt it wasn't properly put in place,4
"Pretty good food, I always get mcflurries, they never have a broken machine and if they do I've never had an encounter with it.",4
Staff was great food was  a little  old but what do expect from mcdonalds? This is why we don't eat there often.,4
construction out front makes it difficult to get in and out,4
Great experience good food good staff that are usually pretty patient with the nonsense,4
The dining room was open very clean very fast food was nice and hot Bada Butta dat' data McDonald's I enjoyed it during thiese pandemic times it was freasher than normal thank you,4
It's an MCD they are all kinda the same,4
"great food and service, but i have to stop forgetting to never get the shakes here because they taste like soap",4
This McDonald's must still cook their burgers on grill which taste better the others I believed went to hot air fryers uck,4
Last order of the night and the food was not stale and the staff were still polite and welcoming,4
I have been there quite abfew times and personally never had a problem but my girlfriends order has been messed up a few times,4
Good service. Everything good here.,4
It was good food they got my burger right !!,4
"Good place for a fast food meal! The restaurant was clean!, and the service was good!",4

"Our visit was on Friday, 5/12/2023. There is a marked improvement in the service and cleanliness at this location on Ft. Hamilton Parkway. Katherine, the Manager, and her staff (Chris) promptly offered help and solutions to my family's needs. The use of a dedicated staff member to continuously clean the dining area was a big plus. I only feel that the beverage station should be closer to the dining area to facilitate the transfer of drinks from station to table; particularly for the disabled.
Another, concern was the price of the food. Though there were ""dollar"" options available, the price of the more popular sizes and items was very high. A median-income family of four would be wary of dining more than once a month, if that often.
The name of the counter person that helped us during our visit was Chris. He is a credit to the McDonalds company.",4
I don't know why they every night whatever they like to close the dining room  No time to control it But on the door have a sign showed dinning room open 24 hours And still using the garbage can to block the door,4
"My daughter and I had a very nice experience here. Upon entering, a worker directed us to the order kiosk and inputted the order for us. Then had it delivered to our table!

Don",4
"Food are ok(typically mc), service are good but They don't allow scooter get in.",4
Been coming to this mcdees since 1988 when they had a hamburgler jail and a big yellow slide out in the open. But lately they've had a hard time getting orders right.,4
Here's the flag they currently fly (June 2023) to honor our brothers and sisters who lost their lives defending us.,4
Mmmm to be honest they are pretty fast with their drive-by  orders I cannot complain but they run out of the special items and Frappuccinos pretty fast. Overall food quality is pretty much always fresh!,4
"Easy to pick up my mobile orders. They have soda machines so you don't have to worry about specifying no ice in drinks. They include napkins, straw, and lids. Straws have either been paper or plastic. They do not include ketchup packets, so you have to ask counterstaff. $1 drinks is a perk that no other fast food restaurant has. The dining room has plentiful tables and chairs too, ranging from booths to high stools to couch-like chairs. Easy to get there by Q25 or Q34. Not very close to any subway stations.",4
"Place was busy..no chasier at the time. Just had to order in the kiosk or through the app. I ordered on my phone through the app and I got taken care of in a reasonable time. People who ordered on the kiosk and couldn't pay by card, had to wait for someone to collect the money at the cashier. With all the chaos, I want to say the team was handling it. Download the app on your phone and service will be faster. Also, the app does offer deals and free stuff with purchase.",4
Best mcdonalds in the area but for some reason they charge a few cents more. Not a big deal but just something I noticed. The staff makes fries fresh forreal lol upon request. Nuggs are Hit or miss. But burgers are pretty good. Not a fan of the chicken products from here but the other mcodnalds on 86th and 20 has good chicken,4
"The place seems cool, actually isnt bad as other M",4
Pretty good. About what you expect from a McDonald's ,4
"Pretty average McDonald's, the seating is nice, the service is also quite fast. The food is pretty average. It does get crowded sometimes, so I suggest that you go there knowing what you want so that it's a bit easier for the employees.",4
Fast and efficient service...The food is always fresh,4
"Seems like a new McDonald's, my first time here. Got my food really quick. They have the high tech screen ordering and mobile ordering. Very big parking lot and drive thru windows. My food came out hot and tasted great. I hate getting cold fries. I was given fries right out of the fryer.",4
"Newly renovated! They have added extra drive thru lanes. LOL! I think we waited longer to get food. The fish sandwich was good, but fries tasted like yesterday's!",4
It was used to be one of very convenient McDonalds stores. No dine-in services and no restrooms make things difficult for everyone. I can't imagine how every place is going to ,4
"TLDR: You can get the BTS meal here - two sauces and special bag included.

Never thought I'd be writing a review for a McDonald's, yet here we are. Was disappointed to hear that the purple packaging isn't available in the U.S. (@Corporate: missed opportunity!). Hesitant because the paper bag adorned with the BTS logo was not guaranteed to be available at all locations. Fears were quelled, as I saw other guests sitting outside, and the elusive BTS paper bag going for $70+ on eBay was elusive no longer. Utilized the self-service machines to order - quick and easy. Medium and large sizes available (opted for medium, which was more than enough food in hindsight). Liked the Cajun sauce more than the Sweet Chili sauce, but just a personal preference. Total of the medium BTS meal was $8.39 + 0.74 tax = $9.13. Food was nothing special; just happy to support the boys.

As always, please be kind to food service workers.

Borahae! ",4
"Good local fast food service, located in the neighborhood at 73rd Avenue & Kissena Boulevard. People are always friendly, whether you eat in or take out. So pickup from sausage on a biscuit, pancakes with or without sausage, burgers, apple pie, coffee or fountain soda, at times has special promotions, nice variety menu.  They do have a kids room for parties,  Large parking lot or drive order menu board then drive up window and pay.  Opens early to late.",4
"Place is spacious, clean, had parking, and 2 bathrooms.  But when I went they had no Automated teller machines, and only one Human Cashier during a busy time of day.  Completely inadequate.",4
"Food was the usual fare, but the ordering process needs work. Asks for Table Number, but do not explain that you need to take a sign to ID your table.",4
"Good place for a quick lunch or snacks
They have so many things  to choose.",4
They renovated this McDonald's and it's huge now. It's still McDonald's but faster drive thru. Still open 24/7 and a good place to satisfy your McCravings,4
"Value 4/5
Taste 4/5
Service 3/5
Presentation of food 4/5
Appearance of the establishment 4/5",4
"Everything was fine, but once i ordered on app and chose drice thru to pick up. The employee was really impatient and sighed.",4
Upgraded but you have to double check your order as they will not give you ketchup or sauces unless asked  & still they will forget,4
"A couple of edp's in here but the staff was friendly.
Staff is out of control today.manager yelling at everybody.nothing is going right.3/21/17
1/4/18 Amazing to see so many employees made it to work in this Blizzard today and seem happy.Good job!!",4
Food is always great but you have be careful with the drive through.  They've forgotten things on my order a few times.,4
"A nice place with good service. Coffee is hot and fresh and better than Starbucks! .  Get there early and it is a relaxing way tot the day.
McDonald's is classic American.",4
"DO NOT GO NOW - under renovation, theres no drive thru either. Other than that they",4
"Ordered via the app and received the food quickly. Fast service, clean and the food was fresh even though we went at peak lunchtime.",4
This day we tried the Mobil app love it but it needs to be where we don,4
Just the average Mc Donalds nothing special. has clean bathrooms and is near a lot of other stores to shop at. A fun place to visit in general I guess.,4
"Why would anyone hate McDonald's?::::::coffee is inexpensive,oatmeal with fruits my favorite ::::I have only eaten fish sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes::::::::::my preference is whole grain bread however it is not on the menu",4
"Very clean, love the new burgers, the the eating atmosphere. But McDonald's and my diet is just a once a month affair. Lol.",4
The usual McDonald's good drunk food. Crowed in drive thru service still pretty quick. Price went up a little not much still good deals,4
This place is very nice and clean. Most of the staff members are very friendly and has smile on them most of the time. Would repeat,4
"It's not bad drive through wise, besides the facr that they allow homeless people to stay there, it has gotten better",4
Nice place & a tad bit busy but you got to make sure your orders at done correctly,4
Is good because it has a play area for the kids. However there are a lot stranger who might approach you to ask for money.,4
Sometimes they cant handles all orders... But so far its good,4
Used the drive-thru. 1 window pay 1 window pick up. Fast once you place your order.,4
"Good service and quality but bad food making, the cheese and ingredients fall out the burger a lot of times",4
Strange drive thru entrance; quick service. Packed with students from nearby high schools around 2-3pm,4
"Convenient location for a fast food restaurant, friendly staff, ample seating, quick turnaround time.",4
Good Food but Mchicken made me destroy my bathroom.,4
Courteous staff and fresh food are the strong points of this location,4

"Very nice and clean, kiosk booths are user friendly for ordering and paying for your food. Just watch out for folks soliciting you for any spare change. And they be touchy. Not cool.",4
"It's an okay place. If you need somewhere to take the weight of your feet, this is a good place.",4
"Well staffed on the weekend. Clean and efficient service. Food is prepped on 2nd floor and ride conveyor down to be bagged. I don't like the idea of not being able to glimpse food preparation operation. However, service is good. Food tastes as expected. Standard, nothing special. Kind of small space. Fine to satisfy immediate hunger.",4
Little but fast,4
"I Rarely frequent McDonald's as a brand, but your beautifully remodeled location diagonal from Penn Station is the ONLY place you can get ice coffee and a breakfast sandwich at 5:30 in the morning! The staff that was on the first time I went where pleaser and efficient. The second time I went,I had to use the kiosk,which frustrated me ( I rather interact with humans) A young lady from the back came out to help me place my order,and I was an appreciative and satisfied customer that morning!",4
"Although this particular McDonald's is located in the heart of Manhattan, the service was very friendly just not very expeditious. The food was consistent with McDonald's Fair so I guess it was okay overall I mean it's McDonald's you going to like it or you don't and I'm sure most people that's reading this have at least visited one in the lifetime if not more and they're different depending on who you go to and what day but the food to be consistent if the food sucks everything about the experience sucks okay have a great day until my next one.",4
"Not 5 Stars just because of the homeless around that block. But everything inside it's all good. The food always good, the wait time always good. Never had a problem here, the only annoying are the crazy aggresive homeless that sometimes go there. Other homeless are calmed and just ask for food outside.",4
Good but too busy,4
"Was nearby and felt like a good burger.

They had their two for $5 fish fillet deal, so I decided to try it out.

This location is usually busy but almost always has places to sit.

Pretty good perk, also has a nice view on the 2nd floor.

The sandwiches were well made, but Ive also gotten sub-par burgers in the past (stale and",4
"NYC bedlam as usual,  but food was hot and good",4
"Fast service, food is good. Usually busy around lunch time. Modern looking with 3 floors to sit and self ordering kiosks. They sell pastries as well, which I haven't seen in other McDonald's.",4
Fast service but the ordering machine should be fine-tuned to be more user-friendly. There is one staff who is otherwise on standby to help guests with the machines. Dining area is clean and nicely decorated. Great views by the glass windows at the upper floors. Free Wi-Fi is pretty reliable.,4

"Great coffee in the morning for only a buck any size anyway. Love it, the best coffee! Food is scrumptious especially anything on the menu but for me the breakfast is my favorite!",4
"I went on last Wednesday and the automatic machines didn't work for ordering inside. The place was full, too tight for people that were there eating. Apart from this good and quick service.",4
"Good fast food as expected :) I just don't like the fact the pickup panel is not used, need to keep hearing the ladies calling your number.",4
"McDonald's food is usually the same everywhere I go. Yay fastfood. I went to this one during the Big Apple Comic Con 2017 weekend. They handled the con rush well. Costumes and hungry cos players can be a struggle, but the managers were right there with their employees making sure everything was ok. A homeless dude was asking for money. Kind of sucked, but they got rid of him quickly though.",4
Fast foods fast food.. Always busy here but fast and they didn't mess up my order so I guess that's good.,4
Good spot to just grab a quick bite. The lines vary depending on the time of day especially given the pandemic.,4
The employees where very kind n tge store was clean the whole experience was pleasant the one thing wrong was they didn't have the third floor open so limited space n someone left so we could sit down they should of had tge third floor open.,4
Clean restaurant. Amiable staff. The food should have been hotter.,4
I don't eat McDonald's but my grandson liked this place especially the upstairs dining area. I was a little disappointed with the wait time but most of the employees were kind.,4

And finally (a fundamental and important detail these days) there is Wifi! So I recommend this place! ",4

Cleanest McDonalds Ive been to in awhile. No major issues except I think my bun was molded they said i,4
Shamrock shake was delicious... always a bit hectic in there but they get the work done,4
Probably the cleanest McDonald in the city.  It's partly due to the posted security at the front door to prevent transient homelessness to take over.  Also the competent day and night managers who motivated the food preparation team to perform optimally.  This place should be the exemplary MacDonald store that all the other macDonald stores in the city should learn from.,4
They got fast hands to make a sandwich from 5 Seconds no wait in this day over crying good food hamburgers taste like McDonald's,4
Standard run of the mill McDonald's. We only had a coffee and a hot chocolate. But no problems,4
It's a good place to go and get a quick snack and drink ,4
"Pretty busy and kind of dingy in lighting McDonalds. Service is not as fast as you might like, however the food is quite fresh.",4
The place seems very understaffed for the amount of traffic thats comes through this store so the registers are usually empty so order at the kiosk. The food might take a bit also but it,4
The Big Mac wasn't fresh but service was fast.  ( I would like to suggest everyone to download their McDonald's app. They offer great deals & rewards points to receive free food ),4
"Mcdonald's food  is Mcdonald's food notting to it.
I don't like the manager.
But the location is very cool and the music gives you a good feeling.
Again I just don't like the manager.",4
"They had a very limited space, but to make an agile experience, they have two big touch screen menus to place your order faster than going to directly to the cashier line. They only have one unisex restroom, so if you are in a hurry, be prepared mentally to wait. Anyway I think you'll enjoy your meal, if you take in consideration these things.",4
"Very friendly staff, looks clean & service is great",4
"NEW MANAGER, NEW VIBE. great experience!!  The homeless shelter vibe is gone, the place is clean, the service is good. Thanks for adding the security guard and the great new management. Well that didn't last long... The new manager apparently didn't last.  It's still better than it was before though..",4
"Absolutely functional! You can order fast and sure, when I went I was sure that It would take lot of time but that didnt happen, the food was cooked in just a few minutes, and it",4
Pretty cool one.,4
You can sit and eat inside. The quality of the food is always on point during Breakfast and lunch hours. I have yet to visit during dinner hours.,4
"Very quick service, surprisingly easy to operate their self service kiosk. Order was ready really fast. I usually don't go to McDonalds but I was in a tight time crunch. For a McDonald's restaurant it was not very busy. I would definitely go back to this location if I needed to go to McDonalds in New York City. Highly recommend stopping in to this location if you are in the area.",4
"This is a 24/7 location, which is great. The receipt printer was broken for a while which was annoying because they would still read off the order numbers as a method of calling people. Also, the layout is a bit odd. It narrows significantly in the middle of the store, making it hard to get through to the doors and the counter at busier times.",4
Best for quick breakfast.,4
"Great service, and extremely quickly served.
Very friendly, kind and professional staff.
Will most certainly visit again.
And yes, the food in McDonald's is always satisfying. An American Classic.",4
"It's not a bad McDonald's by any stretch of the imagination, but there are better in Manhattan.  It's fairly clean, there's plenty of seating, the food was made well.  There are none of those fancy new ordering kiosks, and the bathrooms are dirty.",4
Better service than usual. manager moved my order along. He wanted my order number to ease the wait!!,4
"It was my first time visiting this location it was nice. It was clean, staff was helpful. I would visit again if in the area.",4
"Not bad manager is rude to customers n employees, food was good kid at register was very nice",4
"Taylor was absolutely amazing to me...
This was great experience after having bad ones at other locations. Very happy. Will come again.",4
Restaurant is a ghost town and I am thankful for it (lots of non paying customers normally around). Food is fresh and staff is very efficient.,4
"crispy spicy chicken sandwich,crispy spicy chicken sandwich,crispy spicy chicken sandwich is all i have to say you must stop in and get it and mix it with a hamburger and you will have whats called a mcgangbang you will be glad that you did so, and will never get anything else, please stop and get a milkshake and fries with a stop in there.",4
"Its... McDonald's. If you've been to one you've practically been to them all. Service was nice enough around breakfast time, food quality can be hit or miss, do they even care about Google reviews?",4
Have to wait for a while before I,4
"Meals and counter service have improved. Open 24 hours to a diverse crowd of locals, tourists and visitors.",4
Good ice vanilla sugar free coffee,4

"Decent enough McD. Service fast, fries hot and fresh, no trouble finding a table.",4
"It's McDonald's what more can I say. Other than it gets really busy there, though checkout wasn't too long. Lots of shopping nearby.",4
"Not much I can say, it's a McDonald's. Customer service was good.",4
"Good service, can use the kiosk to order with credit cards",4
I don't eat here but it's clean and there's machines that you can pre-order at,4
"Nice place, food is good, quick service, price is ok...",4
Not usually crowded which I like. The staff could smile more though.,4
Always a pleasant place to stop for lunch and take a break.,4
Service was quick food on the other hand was k,4
Convenient with the kiosk to customize my order and pay wirelessly.,4
"Your average McDonald's. Short wait, ok food, fast service. You get what you expect from McDonald's.",4
One of the nicer McDs. Friendly staff and clean place to eat,4
The service was good the bathrooms are very dirty,4
Good for late night bites near the train while around the NYU area.,4

"I used the drive thru today.
It was quick.
Free off street parking lot.
Building was clean and well maintained.
To pay the clerk put the card reader outside so I could put my own card in the machine.
Safe I guess?
Food was typical McDonald's food. Good
Warm. Not Hot.
Had #9 Large with a Diet Coke.
2 Cheeseburgers and FF
And a LG Soda.",5
Location was clean and modern. Staff were frienldy and efficient. What stood out here the most was the quality of the food preparation. It was almost as if I made it myself and it tasted great. Prices were good too. Highly recommend.,5
Very clean place. Pleasant to be there. I noticed that meat quality could be better.,5
Fast and always get the orders right. All you can ask for.,5
"We grab late night on occasion Fries always hot and and fresh.
Maybe we are just lucky.
Could be a little warmer inside.",5
"Manager went out of her way during a rush to get apple pies in and out for my kids, exception service.",5
"We had a issue with a missing item on our previous order, When we went back to the Store- the Manager Lucas took care of it and was very polite and provided the best customer service. If you have an issue ask for Lucas, he is a good Manager . Thank you",5
"I Honestly can not believe that I am going to give the McDonald's in Brodheadsville five/5 STARS!!!!
They deserve it they have proven it to us over and over again..  The New Manager (wish I knew her name) has taken this location from a zero/0 to getting a rating of Five/5 Stars and I know that it could not have been easy. I have picked up dinner her once a week for 8-9 weeks in a row and the FOOD has been great.  Thats a lot considering its a McDonald's. My food when I picked it up was always hot, all the food was there correctly. Everything was well made and put together.  You can tell the new manager has set the standards extremely high at this location and the employees have responded extremely well for her. She deserves a big hand for caring about her staff and customers.
Thank You for Caring.......
Great job!!   Well done!!!!!",5
Great place to eat friendly staff,5
"Was able to get dinner in just under 9 minutes from the moment I entered the drive-thru line that was lined up almost to 209 to the moment I was pulling away from the window with my food. My order was accurate, warm, neat, and tasty. The staff were quite pleasant to deal with and very calm, despite the massive dinner rush.",5
"Food was hot, prepared properly and delicious. The employees were all helpful and kind. Place was also very clean.",5
This McDonald's in wind gap has a manager who cares about the customer and about placing a good product out for the customer. The staff there is always friendly and helpful. They also make sure you get your burger how you want it and stacked properly so you can eat it without a big mess in your hands and let's not forget about the hot fries. I have heard her tell her employees to make sure people get hot fries. Nobody does that except for her.  That's why this is the best McDonald's.,5
"1st let me apologize for butchering the spelling... but Jamizia has this place on lock! Been in twice recently and usually have a difficult order due to picky kids. Both times she made sure my order was perfect! An i still had my order by the time i was done getting drinks! Her management is on point! She was keeping the flow going, directing staff, and made sure all her guest were taken care of promptly! Highly recommend this location!",5
"My son and I come to this McDonald's about once a month. It's usually pretty clean here, with the exception of a dirty table now and then. That just means they didn't get out there yet! On this trip...our food was great, but there was this little chubby kid who was left st the table with his 2 way young siblings. He was loud and walking the baby and stressing me out! I have him the EVIL EYE!! Hahahaha anyway the food is always good here, bathrooms have always been pretty clean here too.
It's normally fairly quiet here and lots of high school kids in and out. Chubby kid just enhanced our visit!!",5
Food was good  hot a d order was right staff was friendly,5
"Food was very fast, fresh, and hot.  The whole place was packed.  Very clean.  I was impressed.  I ordered and they called my number before I even walked over to get my drink .  I used the bathroom before I left and it was even clean.",5
Evening shift gave us warm fresh food.Surroundings/parking lot was Very clean. To top it off we got a super great Window person.,5
"They are very polite, quick and the food is good.",5
"My Son works here, so of course customer service, and the cooking of food items is outstanding ",5

"To McDonald's which has changed drastically for the better. You can have breakfast all day long. Breakfast very large for onky $6 something had scrambked eggs, hash brown sausage patty , biscuit and 3 pancakes. New Quarter Pounder has been made up differently with lettuce and tomato now. Still a great place to go low costs and good quality.",5
"Their Customer Service is top notch.

"Went late night, about 7 cars ahead of me but it went quickly.  Thank goodness that something was still open",5

This location is always running no matter what time or day. The food is always fresh and the service is usually fast. If they ever mess your order up they usually do right by you and give you a fresh new order. This location was renovated recently so everything is brand new. They no longer have the children's play area but it's much more of a sit in restaurant style McDonald's.,5
"I get my combo meal once a week as a treat. Food, service, parking is good. The place can get packed at certain  time of the day, but have a bit of patients .U will meet rude customers once in a while .Good job to all those employees for their hard work to serve everyone whether its drive thru, dine in, take out, deliveries , curb side pick up etc .Its just my opinion and experience with them .",5
"They have good people working here. The workers won't just let you stand there waiting. They always see people standing there and ask ""what is your order number?"" and then go look for it. For super fast service DL the mobile app and order/pay online.",5
"Is this close to a school? Lots of noisy teenagers hanging around here. Other than that it has an interesting seating arrangement. Just come at a slower time if you plan to enjoy your meal/snack dining in. I do notice the regular pricing is higher than nearby McDonald's. There is lots of curbside pickup parking, drive thru often busy. Ask for ketchup and sauce, they never give it by default.",5
Great staff members clean and little wait time,5
Fast and clean. Good parking and area. Why not.,5
Food was hot.  Service was fast and pleasant.,5
"The regular parking spots were taken, but there was ample mobile order curbside service parking. I'd never ordered that way before, but it was for take out anyway. An employee delivered the food within 5 minutes of placing the order. Overall it was a good experience.",5
I used the curb side feature. It's excellent,5
"The food was top notch and very enjoyable, the inside of the place is above average in size and variety if seats and tables. Customer service was amazing and the place has multiple places to order in their drive through for multiple people at once.",5
Just the right amount of salt and fat  to raise my blood pressure and help clog my arteries.,5
The food was amazing I love it I mean the lady who was cleaning was being rude but besides that it was great,5
After renovation this place has become one of the newer McDonalds around. Things have also gotten busier but that means fresher food.,5
Staffs are good.good service.,5
"Stopped by on my way to work... Very fast, drink was made well and food was food lol I appreciated their prompt service",5
"Very fast, clean and good service.",5
Always service with a smile! It makes my day to see the smiles of the who great me at the drive thru windows.  And yes you can see the smiling behind the masks.,5
"Got BOGO Quarter Pounders during my break, service was quick and the burgers tasted really good. Added some extra toppings and the amount was perfect.",5
"Service is incredibly fast. Just done with the register, not yet put back my wallet in pocket and my order is ready.  Workers are pleasant, patience and with no attitude mostly.  What I like most about it is that they do not impose any unnecessary rules and restrictions on people there plus incredibly pleasant and open minded with people from various backgrounds.  This the best McDonald's in the area I have seen.",5
"Been there since yesterday, and the place looks fairly nice after it's been renovated

Rating: 10/10",5
"This has probably been the best Mcy D's I have ever been in 10 years. I really don't eat McDonald's much but I'm glad I did today. The staff were super professional, sweet, and down to earth. The food was hot, not barely warm, but Hot. Thank you guys ",5
Excellent food and service. I always go for the specials and they never disappoint. Gnocchi was delicious. The outdoor section is really pretty. And the bread on the table is a great combination. I always end up with lunch the next day especially with the pasta dishes.,5
"My son and I love coming here. Amazing staff, food is great, and the new renovations look great. A shout out to Nick who works here.. thank you again for smiling and making my son feel very welcome.",5
Mic Ribby was smacking. Atmosphere was a 'lil lackin'. Service? It was slappin'.,5
Very friendly fast service,5
"Thanks for the kind nice Ashton!!!
U r the best guy help me a lot during the midnight~",5
"Still unable to eat inside , now yo set your order on the screen yourself , I like it that  way , so I have no problem .
The girls were very helpful and friendly handing out the order .",5
"Recently renovated. Food tastes fresh and before the pandemic shutdown, the place was spotless. Offers 2 drive through order lanes for speedy purchases.",5
"This particular drive through is nice and fast. Its easy to get a Big Mac, fries and a coke in less than 5 minutes. Staff is also very helpful all around. This is one of the faster drive throughs in Queens or indeed the five boroughs.",5
"Went to the location on 73rd and Kissena Blvd. last night for the first time since the renovation.  It was a very nice experience.  The renovations was nice but most of all, the staff was so very pleasant and could not have been more helpful.  Such lovely people.  Thank you.",5
"This is my local McDonald's for the past 25 years. The owner/manager is always around keeping her staff ready to take the next order and pleasantly. The food is served as expected which is hot and delicious and the appearance of the store is upkept and maintained well. Drive thru cashiers could all improve on listening well and confirming orders. A smile goes a long way especially when they made a simple #2, large w/ coke to be complicated. After 25 years of coming to this McDonald's, I leave happy til next time!",5
There's a asian worker that like to help people with McDonald's kiosks order if you want to learn and make your order more faster by yourself ,5
"They're really quick most days. Have no issues redeeming offers from the app. If the QR code doesn't scan, they still take care of it. Kudos!",5
Nicest McDonald,5
"This seems like a new building. But better than that is the super friendly staff! Every employee with whom we spoke was super nice, polite, helpful and smiling! Highly recommend this McDonalds!",5
As soon as I walked into this establishment I was greeted with friendly staff and a short line to wait on. The cashier Nia helped me pick out exactly what I wanted because I was indecisive and her recommendations really did help. Thank you once again and this is very rare to find a McDonalds as nice as this one,5
Pretty big store and a lot of tables to feel comfortable,5
By far this is the best Mcdonalds in Queens and Brooklyn. The staff and service is well put together. The food is always hot not like the other Mcdonalds. I've been here a few times awesome.,5
The employee directing people to use the kiosk was very helpful and I would have posted pictures but it was so good,5
It's better than most McDonald's I've been to. Quick service and the food is well prepared. Can't really ask for more.,5
Staff went out of their way to help. Food was good and hot.,5
I've only been here late nights so far but service has always been prompt. The workers are great and work efficiently despite all the people that come here.,5
Many people dont have the time but just go on the drive thru and you will have great time cuz you speak to 3 people one takes your order one says the price and one gives you your order so if one is not being wat you,5
"What i most like from this McDonald's is the ground play, I took my nice an nephew and they got a good fun day, there is table inside the play area so you can eat and watch closely your kids...
Really loved this place.",5
"The gentleman that was working there that afternoon was very helpful and friendly, thank you so much! You should be manager",5
I had a good experience at my nearby McDonald's. I got a breakfast. Everything went well.,5
"Gotta say...this is the best McDonalds around.  Drive thru is quick, and if you ask for ketchup or dipping sauce, they give you more than one.

Open 24 hrs, you can't beat that!",5
Clean and friendly! But don't order Uber Eats the food was cold! And they took longer then expected. I hate that waiting and waiting! 25 minutes late that's just not good service.,5
"They totally redid the store, modernized and bright. The order kiosks help you customize orders and service is very fast.",5
"If you order at the kiosk, they'll bring the food to your table.",5
Very good,5
Great workers!,5
Love this place is nice and clean the people that work there are so nice and polite they also bring your order to the table great place ,5

Friendly staff. The touch screen machines are easy to use and there,5

To DIE FOR,5
Great McDonald's,5
My kids favorite,5
"I used to eat here when my kids were little because there is a play area just for kids. Now the playground has been dismantled and redecorated, adding seats designed for the elderly, two extra-long tables, and a self-service ordering screen. The outdoor parking lot has also added a self-ordering place, and you can scan the QR code with your mobile phone or download the APP to complete the order.",5
The good thing is to take away because to eat there you refuse,5
A very cool place to share with the family,5
Excellent service ,5

"This McDonald's is pretty okay, but at night junkies tend to wander around this area. Obviously not the restaurant's fault though it's worth noting. I always do app orders, and haven't had any issues in the past year or however long. The wait seems normal to me. I definitely prefer this location to the larger one on 8th Ave.",5
It was good. There was a mistake on my order it was fixed no problem. The machines were having some problems and this made the lines a little long. But it was fine.,5
Great service and very clean. Staff is working hard. Enjoyed the visit.,5
