"The main attractions were shut while we still paid the full entrance fees, without any intimation either online or as the ticket kiosks",1
"Visited Disneyland Hong Kong today March 15, 2019. Poor experience. Very little there in the first place in terms of rides and other experiences. But most of it was closed for renovations (including the main Disney castle) or lots of stuff just not open anyway. Kids coulddon't get pics with their fav characters as they kept disappearing for a break every 20 mins and queues were long already. All this missing and not even a reduction in the already expensive price. Pretty crappy day outSmall park, half open. Not worth the money.",1
"Every year I come to Disney with my children, every year is worse than the last one!!!!Prices for entrance tickets are outrageous, specially taking in account that the rides are minimal...Food prices are not normal, even for Disney, super hyper expensive, horrible food, even the junk food is tasteless!!!Only good thing about this place is leaving it!!!!",1
"I'm writing an honest and truthful opinion of this park. I'm not paid by anybody to discredit Disney. If you in HK, do not go to this rip off expensive overpriced park, which is not even worth HK$10 let alone paying over HK$400. There's no attraction, the rides are garbage, no decent food court and the price of the food is three to four time the price. this theme park is just as big as the Victoria Park in HK.Those who are commenting about how wonderful the time they had must have been paid by Disney or high with something. I would rather go to Ocean park which is much bigger and more things to see and do.Just to get to Disneyland you are paying US$ 15 20.",1
"Visited from Australia. Enjoyed the rides, parades and shows. Disappointed the toy train ride was closed. Knew the castle would be under renovation. The biggest let down was that as we were leaving, we decided to pop by the gift shop to buy a Mickey and Mini Mouse plush toy (in the Chinese outfits) which was under the sign that said 2 for HKD298. When we went to pay, the girl behind the counter said it was HKD168 each. We took her colleague to show her the offer sign and she said it didn   t apply for Mickey and Mini, but that it was for other plush toys (Duffy and friends toys only). The girl was very condescending and made us feel unpleasant. So we accepted and bought it for HKD336. When we left to Hong Kong airport 2 days later, at the Disney store in the airport (we didn   t know there would be one there) we saw the same deal: 2 plush for HKD298 and we asked if it applied to the same Mickey and Mini mouse, and lo and behold the girl at that store said it did! that is, 2 for HKD298!! So how is it that at Disneyland park the store did not honour the offer when the other store did? We were very disappointed that the staff were very rude when we tried to enquire about the offer that was rightly given to everyone at the airport store, but did not give us this offer when it was clearly stated on the stand in the main Disneyland?!? This made what would have been a great day at Disneyland very unpleasant. We have discouraged our family & friends to visit Hong Kong Disneyland due to this unpleasant experience. Disney, we would like you to be more honest in your promotions and to honour what is stated in your pricing. ",1
"Full of Mainland tourists, spitting and pushing and shoving. IS NOT THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!!! Expensive!!",1
"Dumb to go.America Street is a boring place because the prices aidon't cheap and much can be bought elsewhere.The other zones are horrible,with too much people and staff not doing much for the adventure.Very unhappy during the whole trip.",1
Having visited Disneyland Paris some 25 years ago we decided to spend the last day of our holiday at Disneyland Hong Kong. The rides were outdated and given HK love of all things electronic we expected more. There was a greater variety of rides in Paris. The parades started late   so we missed the last few minutes of the evening parade as we had a coach pick up to meet. The parades were not a patch on Paris some 25 years agoThe majority of the staff were rude and unhelpful   unlike the Paris staff. Given that English is widely spoken in HK a lot of the staff barely understood English. Putting it mildly it was an utter disappointment from start to finish.,1
Extremely average rides. Please save your money and go to Universal Studios in Singapore! They don   t get anywhere close to creating the magical experiences they promise to! The park was too crowded with sections shut down for renovations. After paying for an entry it seemed like you are eternally in a queue for rides or exhibits that were extremely disappointing!,1
"Its not the fault of Disney that such a bad typhoon storm hit and closed and disrupted operations. It is their fault and responsibility in how they handle the ensuing customer issues.When we explained to Mr.Dominic Chanat the Hong Kong Disneyland Reservation Center that we travelled far with our kids, paid for plane tickets, paid hotel, etc and bought silver passes to the park and had limited time he didnt seem to care. The park was closed during our stay for one day and many things in the park were not running or closed. All we asked was to be able to use our passes on Saturday to make up for the closed day and the other problems as we leave Sunday.He gave us the magical template answer with a NO, passes cant be used on Saturday with no consideration. Greed before customer concern is how they responded to the aftermath of the storm.The park is currently in disarray and best to avoid until they get the place fixed up and can ensure us that all the attractions have been inspected for safety due to storm damage that may compromise safety.",1
"Hugely expensive (  126.40 for one adult and one 14yo.) for what surely must be the smallest of Disney's park offerings. If you expect western style junk food, think again, this was worse. The rides were good. Queue discipline was at times bad with ignorant people shoving their kids past us and when their kids cried out that the adults coulddon't get by to join them, we reluctantly let them through too. The fairytale castle, tiny as it is was behind hoardings as I guess they were working to add extra magic with the diggers that were there. Go to Ocean Park instead.",1
"Smallest Disneyland, I finish walking the whole place in 30min. Strongly recommend not to even spend time here.  Service also very bad!",1
"if you like queuing behind thousands of Mainland tourists for hours then visit this 'attraction'It is small,, on the way to the airportThe Govt allocated an equal portion of land for expansion adjoining this site which has not been taken up on.Better to go to Ocean Park",1
"My daughters graduated from college; in addition, her 21st birthday and we decided to celebrate by visiting HK Disneyland. Disneyland was suppose to be the highlight of our trip, we were totally disappointed. I   ve visited Disney in Florida and California and thought it would be great to take her to HK. HK was fun, but Disney was more like a neighborhood carnival and not worth the time or money. Would definitely not recommend for anyone over the age of 5 or anyone who has visited Disney in the US.",1
Bought a 2 day ticket and there was't even enough there to fill a day. A waste of money. Bought food vouchers snd it was hard to find snything worth while eating. It was extremely hot and very little shade in themes or between them. Not a patch on the original disney theme park in Anaheim. Only a couple of rides or attractions that match the original. The merchandise was extremely ecpensive. The best thing about the park was the staff. Most were very helpful and pleasant.,1
"I was visiting with my five month old baby and had a toddler too. I only went for rides with no height limits. We used our priority pass to skip the line for the slinky dog ride. They let us sit in the ride then because their dad was with the toddler and did not get a cart behind or in front and we wanted to sit together, so we got off and waited for the next turn. Once we waited for the first round to end, we were told because they gave out the bone tickets for the round after, we had to wait one more round. So we would get on the third round. Finally, it was our turn then the staff proceed to say my five month old has to sit by herself on the seat and not on a lap, I got angry. I waited there for three rounds and even sat in a ride cart and not one staff says a word about my baby on my lap. Then when I was about to sit next to my family and enjoy the ride they tell me I can   t have my infant on my lap. She can   t even sit by herself. They did nothing but say she can ride if she sits by herself and that plenty of babies ( pointing to toddlers and pre school aged children saying those babies can do it, why can   t mine) as if blind to my child   s small size in comparison. I asked for a manager, while waiting the staff that let me on the ride then kicked me off ran away to hide.If they told me when they saw me in line they should have said something then everything would have been fine. I waited in front of their eyes and even sat in a cart and three rides later they refuse to let me board the ride saying no lap sitting is just a waste of my time and use of my priority pass.",1
"Let   s just say you pay and good luck to you! Employees have no Disney Magic, food is horrible and the are rude and don   t care. Don   t spend your money. Super small and is currently under construction.Trip not worth it. If you want to enjoy Disney highly recommend Orlando Florida Disney World (love it been there 3 times in 5 years) Animal Kingdom is great for kids. Epcot has the best food. Water park so much fun. or Disneyland in California ( was a pass holder and it was worth it).",1
"We went there March 31,2018. I was with my 6 yr old child. When she saw the stormtrooper mascot she was very excited to go there. We ran towards the stormtroopers and she happily raised her hand and waiting to be called. They were pointing out children or couple who will have a chance to have photos with them. My child kept on raising her hand and we were there standing for almost 20minutes. My child didn   t want to go until she was called. But I   m so tired and so I told her to go to Storm Troopers directly thinking that they will allow her since they kept on grabbing couples    who didn   t wait there   , children who just    passed by    or children who doesn   t want to have photos with them but apparently she was turned down by that stupid Storm Tropper assigned on March 31,2018 around 4pm. For just taking a photo with my child who   s only dream was to go to Disneyland made her cry because the mascots wanted to just grab people who didn   t even    wait   ! Isn   t it that HongKong Disneyland is really for kids and they think that it is the    happiest    place on Earth and staffs should make everybody happy?! That stupid Storm Tropper made my child cry and hurt her feelings! It was ok if we were rejected because we didn   t wait there for too long. But we did! We waited Soooooo long! We waited more than 20minutes for just a photo to make a child happy. With just a click and less than a minute they can already make somebody happy but that stupid Storm Tropper rejected because they wanted those who didn   t WAIT. If we were celebrities they would allow us fast but we were not! I suggest to have a new policy with the mascots! All the mascots should have a line to take photos and everybody should have a chance especially those who    WAITED   . we paid so much more that we deserve that right to have a photo with whoever we want. Hong Kong Disneyland hurt my child and I want everybody to know it because they can   t take it back again!!!Calling out HongKong Disneyland Management fix the attitudes of your mascots! Or make new policy on taking photos!",1
Overcrowded and maybe you get to ride on two or three things whilst queuing for hours Get there really early and try and beat the crowds however it wodon't be for longThey let far to many people in its a real jokeSpend the money and go to The original in Orange County USAMuch much better,1
"Overall I actually love Disneyland and had a pretty great time. What ruined in for me was no one spoke to me. I've had rheumatoid arthritis since I was two and use a wheelchair and at every attraction bar one or two (shout out to guy at the carousel) every single employee asked my husband if I can walk transfer. After 27 years in a wheelchair I had gotten used to it (which is messed up in itself), but I found that once I had children people realised I could most likely respond. I had my three year old in my lap 90% of the time and my six year old nearby. I was usually chatting to them when the cast would overlook me to speak to my husband.I'm feeling a little less than because of this treatment. No one deserves to feel overlooked and less than. Merry Christmas Also   I'm a speech pathologist.... ",1
"First queued for 45 minuets for opening then at ten o   clock it opened well we thought it had opened , no got to Main Street with a white line across the street to be stopped by staff , which honestly made the gestapo look like angels you dared cross the line and they were on you like a pack of hungry wolves do not cross the line the park opens at 10.30am another half hour wait .Half past ten came and by this time there were thousands waiting to go which to me was dangerous as people surged to get to the rides , but wait only certain parts were open the rest wouldn   t open until 11.00am again chains across the paths and more aggressive border guards ( don   t cross the line ) this put a real down on the day if we knew we would have waited until lunch before going .The park it self is quiet small and the rides just average and after the opening downer we stayed for lunch and left before 2.00pm , my advice is good for families but don   t go until after lunch unless you want to stand around for hours while the whole park opens and you aren   t scared to cross the line in case of snipers and aggressive border guards ( even kids were aggressively told not to cross the line )All in all if your only adults don   t bother a waste of money better spent elsewhere Magic kingdom it ain   t more like Stalag 17",1
"I went with my boyfriend for our final day in HK, the park itself wasdon't overcrowded and was quite cute. The rides aredon't huge and its fairly small in comparison to other Disney theme parks but I didnt mind that. What I did mind however,...More",1
"We are a group of 10 with 3 children, the food is bland and tasteless, the kids menu is a waste of money because its worst than the adults. This is a pricey place, it would have been ok if the food is good but for what we ate, its not worth it. Even the staff are not friendly. The only good I can think of ,is the ambiance which is better than the other restaurants there, otherwise avoid this restaurant .",1
"We went to Disneyland on the worst day, it being the national holiday it was super busy but it was our last full day in Hong Kong so had no choice. We bought our tickets on klook so slightly cheaper. The people were so rude, not staff but other customers, pushing, shoving, prodding. Theres no such queuing system, it doesnt matter that you have been waiting an hour, someone will come along, pretend someone else is ahead, get to a certain point and call the rest of the family friends to push in!! Because of the language barrier i got a lot of giggles, shaking of heads and just ignored when confronted them. It happened in pretty much every queue which ruined the whole experience. Also the park is small, theres no cooling system , perhaps more sheltered areas, AC, Fanned areas, even in the queue they could have them water spritzing things, the excessive heat made it uncomfortable. Theres not enough food options, not enough international, we ate at the corner cafe but had to wait 30 mins to be seated. The only good thing is the ease of getting thete, the mtr is easy to use and cheap enough. The disney train itself is a nice touch. All in all a bad day out!",1
"Every kid love Disneyland , but this is nothing for kids , not here in Hong Kong. Yes we all know it   s crowded but you just need to line up for everything , just to make a picture with Mickey and Minnie , my wife and me has to line up 3 hours in exchange , my little daughter can   t wait that long by 37 degree in the sun. After 3 hours lining up , lunch time , another 1,5 hour , just to get something to eat.... beside that   s the food was totally over priced ( that   s OK , we knew where we are ) the taste was disgusting. All in all , my 4 years old Baby girl seen Mickey and Minnie for 40 sec after waiting 3 hours , got a mickey Balloon for 25 bucks had seen Goofy passing thru and then at 3 pm we left after in total being there for just 6 hours....All in all an wasted day in Hong Kong....",1
4 hours 4 rides. Ridiculous waiting times and very hot some places sat 15 minutes wait but are more likely to be 45 minutes. Everything was severely overpriced and the staff are rede and ignorant. Kids were over it after 4 hours and diddon't like it and dodon't want to return. ,1
"Embarrassed for Mr. Walt Disney. The park was created in 2005. Disney had a blank slate to create a world class park. Instead they created an embarrassing tourist trap, that offered an uninspiring place to capture your money only. If Walt was alive he would have fired the person in charge of new park development.... Dodon't waste your time and dodon't waste your money at this park. No wonder The Hong Kong park is losing millions of $$ each year..now they have finally decided to invest big money staring in 2019 to rehab this place.. we live in Los Angeles and have been to Disneyland many many times..and are very proud of the park..but HK big joke",1
"On the day, it was a choice of either Ocean Park or Disneyland. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, we decided to go to disneyland. Travelling there was pretty easy by MTR and rail. However, on the way, we were met by hordes of Chinese mainlanders, each going to the same destination. They are loud and rude and where there is a queue, they will certainly try to skip it. Sadly, this was the main theme throughout the day. After queuing at the entrance, and fighting off every single mainlander's attempt to jump the queue, we finally got in. The sun was shining and it was extremely hot. My advice is to take an umbrella or parasol with you to shade yourself, because there is very little shade indeed within the park. Queuing for the rides wasdon't so bad. They are pretty fast, and you can select a time to return to save yourself some time. This is certainly what you must do for the more popular rides. The rides are generally suitable for children and even those who are afraid of rollercoasters can enjoy them without a fuss. But you must ensure that no one skips in front of you while queuing. Since there are no shades within the park, you are always on the lookout for a shop to relieve yourself with aircon. Although, there are some areas with aircon, there are also many shops that dodon't have it. I find it pretty cheap that they cadon't even turn the aircon on after you pay so much to get in.The food courts are jammed pack. You'd be extremely lucky to get a seat. The mainlanders all rush to get their food and the whole place is absolutely chaotic. It's probably the worse experience you will ever have. Fortunately, they serve the food pretty quickly and you dodon't have to wait long in the queue.By the end of the day, I was so knackered, I just coulddon't move anymore. The heat, the exhaustion, the constant need to fight off queue jumping. Chinese mainlanders will not observe any etiquette and it got me completely mad. I cannot recommend this experience to anyone.",1
It is nice   for half an hour before it becomes overcrowded. Should be covrr for sun.  Unfortunately.,1
I have been to Disney World in Florida once and Disneyland in Californis numerous times. Both are world class entertainment facilities for young and old alike. Hong Kong`s version is a bad joke and a total rip off. Save your money. For this style of entertainment go to Ocean Park on Hong Kong Island. It is light years better.,1
"My family went to HK Disneyland with 3 young kids in tow.Pros   lines weredon't so long given the heat  we stayed in a Disney hotel & the transport to the park system was very efficient Cons   I was nursing my sleeping baby in an air conditioned attraction while my kids learned to draw Disney characters. My baby fell asleep and I've requested if we could stay for a while after the session since any motion will wake her up & the heat outside was unbearable. The answer from the Disney staff was a flat no. So I had to leave with a tired baby in my arms & walk under the heat of the sun. I expected more compassion from Disney, being a family centered theme park.  Bland Chinese food from Maxim's (plus they charge for continents like soy sauce even if they serve dimsum)  Rude staff. I saw how a staff member was so rude to a certain race who was asking how much a drink cost. The staff got the price tag & slammed it in front of the customer. Appalling.I have been to most Disney resorts (except for the newest one in Shanghai) and I must say that HK Disneyland disappointed me during my recent trip.",1
"Dodon't let the staff there unhappy;otherwise,he will put your baby stroller to the place with the strong sunlight intendedly when you're enjoying the attraction ,and  make your baby sitting in the hottest strollers which he takes it as a revenge to you!",1
"Long queues in the sun and got shouted at by a member of staff when I complained my youngest my feeling unwell,",1
"I have been a Platinum Member of Hong Kong Disneyland for 5 years. I regularly check the webpage for shows and information about what is going on. I arrive today to learn that there is a new show for 2 days and, aparently, no places left. I informed them they missed to inform me by the usual channel and, despite my Platinum (and other 5 members of my family's platinum status), they are unable to even give me an stand by status to get into the show. I spoke to the manager. Totally useless.",1
"Unfortunately, HK Disney due to a fault in their website are still holding approx. $700AUD of my cash (debit card)   3 weeks after I attempted to purchase 2 tickets and the website kept advising me my card could not be authorised. Extremely poor & unhelpful service from HK Disney staff during my attempts to rectify this situation. No 'Disney Magic' in this experience !!!",1
"I recently visited HK Disneyland for the second time in March 2017. A large percentage of the venues were  under maintenance . We were disappointed there were so few rides to go on and most importantly, they no longer have curry popcorn! I was shocked they had discontinued this, the curry popcorn was out of this world! We aredon't so much into the characters anymore, but I cadon't recall seeing any characters walking around either. It hardly felt like Disneyland. Next trip to Hong Kong, we'll stick with Ocean Park.",1
"Very crowded place even we were there on a Monday , the waiting line was always with 75 minutes waiting time which is crazy . The kids enjoyed the parade and we had also some food . I cadon't review the rides because we could not try because of the waiting time . We paid 2000hkd to walk in the park and another 800 hkd to eat some snacks way expensive and we did not try the rides because of the crowd . We did try only one ride which is taking pictures with a robot I waited also 20 minutes for it. Never again ",1
"Worst Disneyland i have ever been to, Full of pushy mainlanders, rides were closed and all a disappointment. Do the real thing in the USA avoid this scaled down shambles of a  Disneyland  took my younger sister who is 13 and she was greatly disappointed and said that Ocean park was  a million times better  i take her word for it!",1
"Let me preface by writing we have been to Disney Florida and Disney California. Took my 4 year old twins to HK with me on business and decided to bring them to HK Disney as a treat. My children are biracial Caucasian Asian. I am Caucasian, mom is Asian.My son has light brown hair dark blonde hair and hazel eyes with some minimal Asianfeatures (e.g., no epicanthic eyefold so his eyes look more Westen while his bone structure is more Asiatic). His twin sister has a darker complexion and aside from medium brown hair eyes, she looks like a light skinned Asian toddler.My son was constantly hassled by Japanese and Korean patrons in the park, mostly obnoxious women between the ages of 30 40 years old who not only asked completely inappropriate and racists questions of my wife and I, but also thought it acceptable andOK to take selfies with my son. One of the women, a woman from Osaka, keptreferring to my son as  cute half breed boy. I put a stop to this after around the 8th or 9th Japanese Korean woman did this (mind you this was in the first two hours we were in the park). The final straw for me was when we went to a Disney stage show and the had an Asian woman made up in black face paintperforming a circa  1950's America  song a la Beans & Cornbread in front of a thousandlittle kids.Given the insane price of entry, small size and limited features of this Disney park, notto mention the  merchandizing attempts  every five feet and the profoundly racist experiences we had to deal with, I am crossing this off as a  we'll visit them again  place for the kids. The Ocean Park nearby is much better and nobody thought my childwas a park attraction toy for taking cell phone photos.I'd skip Disney HK and opt for the stateside parks. Maybe we will try Disney Shanghai with better luck.",1
"I've never been in any Disneyland or Disney world so that i took the change while I was in hongkong. Actually the theme park is very small and for the best attractions you need to queue up at least 1 or 1,5 hours despite after 3 hours we where done! I would not recommend to go there for Chinese New Years days asap it is massive over crowed of Chinese mainland tourists : ) in my opinion nice for kids but not worth to see!",1
"My young daughter loves Hong Kong Disneyland so we went often. We've visited the park for 9 years continuously, and we were their loyal  Magic Access Card Members . But we   ve faced constant and repeated assault by other visitors, mainly from Mainland China. We   ve been punched, finger poked, hit by selfie sticks, pushed, stepped on, verbally abused etc. Each time the staff just watched, stood there motionless, and they took no actions. I've had 10 15 minute shouting arguments with people because they've either aggressively pushed me or my child, at times in  It's A Small World  and also  HyperSpace Mountain  where the arguments echoed loudly, but the staff do not help or call any security ! When I've complained to the staff (inside the  rides  or in their  City Hall ); they refused to collect the details of the attackers and they did not call the police. In fact; they've NEVER called the police when I asked for their help ! They would say to me  It's a nice day why dodon't you enjoy the park and rides ! . I   ve sent emails to Hong Kong Disneyland on their security in the park but wthout real satisfaction. To force the personal security issue; on Saturday 3 December 2016 I deliberately took some goods in plain sight from the park   s  Emporium Shop  and walked out slowly until I was caught. It took them 15 minutes to catch up with me. I fully cooperated with the security staff, and I told them my reasons for my actions. My reasons being to high light the lack of personal safety and security within the park, and the fact that all of the security are concentrated in the shops to protect Hong Kong Disney's merchandise. When they caught me I was about to walk back to the shop and return the goods. I had NO intention of keeping the goods. In their INTERROGATION ROOM it was a HORRIBLE  Disney  experience. Harsh, nasty, no empathy, no understanding, a situation I found threatening because I was surrounded by three large security men. There was more security than all of the years I   ve been going there. The attending woman security supervisor ( a  Miss A    a name that sounds like a  musical ) did not care about my reasons. She refused to contact any staff to validate my written complaints. I told her whom to contact and which department, and she refused ! She stated it was another department ! She was robotic and bloody minded ! Her words to me were insulting, and dismissive for the reasons of my actions. She stated to me that they had policies and procedures to follow. I replied that her staff did not follow any policies and procedures when I and my daughter were attacked. She was silent on this. She stated Hong Kong Disneyland will charge me for  theft  and the police will escort me to the Lantau Police Station. She stated that I should take my young daughter with me to the police station because I will be there for a long time. I told her that I could not do that because it will SCARE her. She kept. on saying that  I'm an adult and I should reflect on my actions . That goes both ways ! She lacked the humanity and common sense to understand the reasons for my actions, and she wanted my child to spend hours in a police sation with me ! I spent 12 hours in a police station; and I left at 3am in the morning. Economic loss to Hong Kong Disneyland is ZERO (the goods will be returned to them). Moneatary loss to me will be in the TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars in lawyers fee's to avoid a conviction ! And all because I was concerned about personal security and safety in Hong Kong Disneyland ! It   s clear to me that Hong Kong Disneyland ONLY cares about protecting (and selling) its overpriced cheaply produced plastic goods. When I and my daughter were attacked NO security personnel ever arrived, but when anybody takes their goods without paying then there is an army of security. The fact that Hong Kong Disneyland wants to prosecute me for my actions shows the true nature and character of the company. Yes I REGRET my actions; I was wrong to think so highly of  Disney  that they would understand my actions and the reasons for it. So much for a  caring  company. My daughter cried for several hours because I was in a police station, and my wife was immensely worried by Hong Kong Disneyland's actions against me. I was told,  by that woman , that I will be banned from returning for a year. Return there after this PHYSCHOLOGICAL TRAUMATIC  Magical Experience  ? HONG KONG DISNEYLAND WILL HAVE TO KILL ME AND DRAG MY DEAD BODY INSIDE THE PARK TO EVER RETURN !",1
"Ok, this one will be a short one. You want to visit Disneyland to dream with your kids, right ? Ok then Hong Kong Disney is nothing but the dream.... and why ? Well, the longest queues you will ever stand for, losing your time. Oh and then the dirt on the floor, I will not even go into details, because it is quite disgusting to be honest. The overpopulation in the park and the mass of people make the trip unbareable to be honest. The huge dissappointed and specially when you know Disney Paris, Florida or California... So one good advise. Do not settle for less. Go to the real Disney, dont settle for the mediocre one just because it is nearer......Dont do that to your kids. ",1
Well .. Disney is great around the world with their happy smiling staffs. NOT here. The people who works here mostly have sad and angry faces. They will shout Instructions and man handle you if you look like Chinese. Or course if you are Anglo Saxon they treat you differently. What a regret that we choice HKG as the destination for our 2nd Disneyland visit this year. Tokyo was way way way better. Th attitude and behaviour of the ground staffs has made this a horrible place to be.,1
"Do NOT take your toddler to Disneyworld. The lines for the very few baby rides disallow strollers and clearly not one of the designers has ever tried to stand in line for 40 minutes with a toddler! Apart from It's a Small Small World , the shows and rides are frightening, especially in   dventure land, so you are reduced to the Fantasyland area where there are two main rides, that are almost impossible to access. Surely strollers can be parked at the end of the queue and not at the beginning? Also impossible to shop as there were too few cashiers and no one to assist on the floor, forcing clients to save questions for the cashier, thereby delaying the lines even more as the cashier had to run around finding correct sizes etc.",1
"Disneyland Hong Kong is a very small park compared the ones in the U.S. , very crowded and with very long queues for each attraction.",1
"Absolute waste of money spent aud182 for 2 adults soaked from pouring heavy rain with no rides or outdoor parades being operational.With a 2 year old in tow it was horrible. If parades and rides are cancelled how do you expect patrons to enjoy the full potential of a once in a life time family day out? Complained to manager who woulddon't even budge to give money back or discount. Spent $200 at the Disney store, had lunch and enough was enough so caught mtr back to hotel.So annoyed I could have saved $182 entry fee if I had known there was a Disney store in HKG airport.",1
We entered Disneyland at 1pm. The sad thing is they closed all outdoor rides at 1:30 pm. Well they should have informed us before we bought the tickets. We went to Hongkong just to go to Disneyland. The tickets cost us more than 10k pesos (1617 HKD). They already know they're gonna close based on the forecast and yet they still let us buy the tickets. We only stayed inside for an hour or so. We just took pictures and rode the hyperspace mountain and took off. Bad experience. They only want the money... and didnt care if we lose it. ,1
"On our visit the fireworks were cancelled, the Halloween Event cancelled, there were only two Disney Characters we saw in the park, 60% of the restaurants were closed and we cant access on the web the pictures we paid Disney for. All in all a very disappointing days outing. The park is not what is was and certainly not worth the entrance price.",1
"The service staff Manning the queue at Cinderella photo taking spoil the day for my whole family.Incident happened on 19sept2016 at around 1240pm.was directed to push my baby pram underneath the queue line then when I was trying to get under the queue line,the guy then pulled the rope quite forcefully and it hit my head which he did not even apologise but instead he shouted in a very rude manner.pls note that I do not understand Cantonese and I was just following his gesture.Super bad experience manz.doesnt reflect on Disney at all.does Disney encourages violences and rudeness as well as bad service and attitude?",1
"The park is far too small for the amount of people that are entering. There are long wait times and queues for everything. Security is a joke   they dodon't actually tell you anywhere what you aredon't allowed to take in which means that nobody knows and this creates a huge queue with people asking why they cadon't enter with things and arguing about where they can leave things to collect them on the return. The queue management for everything is just a disaster from buying tickets, queuing to get in and out of the park and buying food   it's slow and badly organised and if you go in the summer most of the time you are waiting outside in 30 degree heat. No ideal at all. There aredon't many rides and you can probably do every single ride in the park in half a day if there were no queues. There was always a queue for the toilet and they were not kept very clean at all. Food and drink is expensive so I would recommend that you took your own   make sure your drinks are in a plastic bottle. The metro station is about a 5 minute walk from the park and be warned that at the end of the day you will have to wait a long time in complete chaos just to get into the metro station. Not sure why Disney doesdon't offer a bus service to the park entrance from the metro station and the buses that take you to the hotels. Buses to hotels were also a complete disaster. You have to wait again in a long queue and the bus stops at the Disney World hotel first and then moves on to the Hollywood Hotel. Not sure why they cadon't have separate buses as it just makes the journey so much longer. Park was a big disappointment and I woulddon't recommend it to anyone. Hong Kong has another theme park which is called Ocean Park. It's much better than Disney, better value for money and better organised. Would not return here and would not recommend to anyone.",1
"Disneyland is more like Lineland. There are lines for everything ranging from 20 to 50 minutes. It's exhausting with a little one. Even taking pictures with the characters. We stood 45 minutes in line to take a photo with mickey and minnie mouse. The characters in costumes keep taking breaks every 5 to 10 minutes probably because it's really hot and humid. They should have replacement people on rotation for how much they earn. Everything is overpriced and just full on capitalism and consunerism in all its glory. I paid 120 HKD for one helium balloon!!!! Only the food at this one Chinese noodle and rice place was reasonably priced. If your child is over 4 years old, well behaved, quiet, patient, wodon't drive you crazy trying to buy every Disney item, has no problem with heat humidity and rain, willing to walk by themselves everywhere then Disneyland hong kong is for you! Otherwise better to pay nothing and spend a day at the park! ",1
Someone is smoking inside the toilet. Inconsiderate tourists rudely cut in somewhere in the middle of the queue (it happens multiple times). My 3 year old Daughter is not happy because of the long queues. We ended going back to hotel early and decide not to complete all rides.Majority of tourists are inconsiderate! Management should do something.,1
"Below was the email I sent to Disney Customer Service, your Director of Guest Experience Services Janet promised to contact me within 5 days BUT she DID NOT. Dear Sir or MadamI am writing this email after my recent depressing and discouraging visit to Hong Kong Disneyland with my mom and my daughter Emma dated 2 Aug 2016. It took several days for me to make this formal complaint because I want to make sure I was not outrageous for the time being but disheartened for good. I do hope you can take some of your time and hear out the story of what happened to us back then.We are Chinese citizens coming from Hainan Province. My daughter is four years old, and she is extremely eager to meet the princesses in person and take photos with them. Hong Kong Disneyland increased the price and Shanghai Disneyland recently opened notwithstanding, we still chose to visit Hong Kong Disneyland because we saw your MARVELOUS advertisement of your wonderful 10 YEARS ANNIVERSARY. We stayed in Hong Kong over the night of 1 Aug and arrived at the Park around 10:30 the next day. However, one hour after our check in when we are queuing up for the raft to the Tree House of Tarzan, the staff dismissed the queue and informed us that all the outdoor activities will be cancelled due to the  3 storm signal. No Cinderella. No Snow White. No Elsa. No Aurora. No Rapunzel. No parade. You cannot imagine how dispiriting and frustrating it was for the 4 year old little girl.It was the first time for Emma to visit an amusement park of its kind. To make this trip colourful and meaningful for her, I spent 8 weekends watching the Disney classic movies with Emma, especially the Disney Princess collections. We chatted over night to discuss which princess she liked the most. We played games together to recreate the scene of each princess movie. Unfortunately, it just turned out that the more you longed for meeting the princess, the more disappointing you got.From then on, at least 3,000 visitors thronged in door and heavily queued up for the only programs left over. We spent at least one and a half hour waiting for the small world. What is worse that we were informed that the park would be closed shortly due to the  8 storm signalI could not just believe it. The dinner was off the record because all canteens and shops in the park shut their doors suddenly. With no restaurants nearby, I had to bring little Emma of 4 and my mother of over 60 back to the downtown without dinner. Not to mention how disappointing we were leaving without seeing the fireworks.I know you would defend yourself using the typhoon excuse, and it is very true, nobody will deny it. Nevertheless, it is your cold heartedness and your negligence that irritate me. Nobody even showed the slightest care for the little boys and girls and the aged. YOU just THREW us out, which is the last thing I can imagine to happen in Hong Kong Disneyland. I cannot understand it and will not accept what had just happened to us. With the modern technology, you should know the typhoon is coming and you know much better than anybody exactly how it will affect the park. It seems to me that you just care more about the number of visitors rather than their expectations and experiences. Maybe you could close the Park for good and post an advance notice, or you could pretend to be sorry and try to be a little bit nicer to your guests, but you chose to do nothing. Oh, I am sorry that you did do something when you made a great effort to kick them out.I chose Hong Kong Disneyland over Shanghai because I believed your 10 years anniversary will be more wonderful than usual; because I believed your staff will be more civilized and more experienced, so that my daughter will enjoy her meeting with princess more happily. Sadly, it is such a fool of me to have believed all this and none of it came true. Of course, it is surely not a trip of empty hand. I   ve learned my lessons: never trust the illusory advertisement. I would love to share my experience with my friends and colleagues who just happen to have kids of the same age like Emma, and I am confident they must be smart enough to learn from mistakes and make correct decisions. Thank you very much for your wonderful service offered to Emma, and she will definitely not badger me again to bring her to any Disneyland around the globe.",1
"On a 38C weather ...Pros: not too much people shorter Queue line great service rendered by Duffy & Shellie May shop Suet, helpful and initiate to have interaction with guests.Cons: Dirty everywhere, cadon't understand if this is Short handed or staffs just not attention to details instead of seeking interaction with guests, 95% of staffs were just Chatting with co workers aside from merchandise shop staffs, See No One Smiling .. Maybe it's Too Hot? But I dodon't this is a Reason, coz they keep Laughing while they chat totally cannot understand the announcement made in microphone, why are they hurrying what they wanna say?!?I mean we can understand all 3 languages, but I was wondering if staff are just trying to do it Fast or Afraid of talking in front of the mic? locomotive staff even PSSST!!! To guests who cant understand its only a one way train. Shouldnt he tell guest Politely? F&B: most of the Restaurants were fully occupied, went to Banquet hall & have a vegetarian cutlet, main dish & salad were fine, but tomota side dish .... Can be better. but over all, most Impolite staff ever seen ...Louise from Dumbo!!! I took a video on how she work, unfortunately unable to post it tripadvisor, anyway if anyone have a Chance of Experience her Services, you will understandhow Terrible she was. Its just No Passion   world Murdered her parents and she want to Take a Revenge to the world .. Everyone in this world is her Enemy!!!Overall experience: Bad attitude from most of the Staffs, but I do Believe this is a Hong Kong Culture .. Just being Impolite, but if you're Disney, then I guess you're carrying the Brand all over the world, & not just a local theme park.Lot of Space to Improve ... To be a Disney!",1
"We have a disabled child in a wheel chair. There was no fast track ticket option or priority line for disabled or wheelchair. The lines for the rides were very long minimum 45 minutes waiting for each ride. When we were waiting in line for a ride, I requested the attendant if we can come ahead in the line as we have a disabled child. She said that we need to provide proof that the child is disabled and need to bring a letter from City Hall that the child is disabled. I said we are tourist, we dont live in HK, how can we bring letter from HK City Hall? She said then we cannot get ahead in the line. My child was in a wheel chair and he has Down's Syndrome. What more proof did this lady want? We had a terrible experience at Disneyland Hong Kong and will NOT recommend this to anyone with a disabled child or wheelchair.",1
"Really has nothing much to see, play or even dine. After visiting tokyo Disneyland and universal studio, this is totally not worth my family's time",1
It was pouring and they only had 10 indoor rides open! Still have to pay full entry and if the weather got worse they coukd close the park and no refunds or passes given! We opted not to risk the $500 entry fee for just the few low thrill rides on offer.,1
"Disappointed to say the least with most of Tomorrow land closed for refurbishment. Not only that but a lot of food outlets were closed as well it was even a challenge to get a drink of water.Take a ride on the train to have a look around only to discover it's just a half journey you disembark and queue again, not that you would bother you only see the fence and trees!If you want to see fireworks go to river fire in Brisbane where Movie world and Dreamworld are better attractions.",1
"crowded place. food is expensive. if you wanna ride be prepared to wait for 30 45 min to be seated. so its time consuming to attempt to ride and see all attraction on a day. staff speaks minimal English. dodon't be shocked cause rudeness is rampant and common.you can bring bottled water inside and small crackers only. but if you are a Chinese national you can bring rice meal!!!!!! prejudice, bias and discrimination at its best!!!!",1
this is not Disney Land it is Disney village... it is very small and not really much to see and do there.... it is really not worth your time or money.. IF it did not have the name Disney attached.. no one would go there.. Disney corporation itself should be ashamed to attach its name to this...Ocean Park is a much more fun and larger park.....go there instead....,1
"Imagine Disneyland, now shrink it in half, now shrink it in half again. Make sure you shrink the main Castle down to about 25% as well. Now, all of the rides for people over the age of 10, remove them! Ok, now with the small amount of things we have left, just for fun, let's also close a bunch of rides and restaurants for repairs and renovations! But here's the really fun part, let's charge full price! ($96.00 AUD for one day!) Welcome to Hong Kong Disneyland! Oh wait, let's make sure we charge ridiculous prices for food as well! ($17.50 AUD for a Cheeseburger Meal!) and while we're at it, let's open the place for 3 or 4 hours less per day than other Disneylands! In the words of Walt Disney,  Give them nothing, take from them everything! This is Sparta! I mean, this is Hong Kong Disney!  While we're at it, let's make sure that staff members dodon't ever smile! Also make sure they never greet you or farewell you in any store or ride or attraction! p.s. bring your own water because it's so humid you'll need about 3 to 4 bottles for the day and they cost $5 AUD per bottle! Also, just be aware that your bags get searched at the entry gate. Also, just be aware that it's not worth going to Hong Kong Disneyland and they should be ashamed of charging the price that they do!",1
"If you are American or travel to the US often, skip the trip out to HK Disneyland. It's the exact same thing with literally only 5 10 products that are unique to Hing Kong and those are mostly key chains and t shirts. Just nothing special for a 45 minute train ride out of town",1
"The place is simply overly crowded. You could easily spend 20 mins queuing for almost every popular program, It is a pain when you travel with young kids. The variety of games available is also too limited. Will NEVER go back.",1
"My wife and I went here on out last day in HK for a bit of fun, just the two of us. Three years before, we went to Disneyland Paris with out two kids and had an amazing time. Sadly, Hong Kong Disneyland was a massive disappointment. ",1
"I write this as a huge Disney fan. We have been to Orlando Disney at least five time and it is very hard to believe that this place is even run by the same people. First of all, half of it is closed down. While they say on the sign that the main rides are closed for a few days for renovations, i think this is an outright lie. From the looks of it, one of the two main attractions(the mining cars) is covered in scaffolding and looks to be shut down for months, not days. This effectively cuts e park in half. Plus, at least one third if all the restaurants were closed, resulting in mass chaos at the one remixing restaurant This, but the way, was on a Sunday in AprilI dodon't know who these people are that say you need two days, but that is absurd. We saw every show and road every ride in about 5 hours on a crowed Sunday. Then, we literally ran out of things to do. And for those of you expecting the the magical experience, you better hop on the next plane to Orlando. The place was filled with overflowing trash bins and miserable employees. And when say miserable, think country fair miserable ( rider is over kid, move on ). ",1
I had gone to Disneyland with my 4 year old daughter and my husband expecting it to be a wonderful experience! But it was a rather unpleasant one!The park had shut down some popular attractions without prior notice! The lion king show was called off even the grizzly gulch rides were off a few others weredon't working as well!During character meet and greet we were asked to que up and we did but I saw a lot of people were breaking the line n getting in from under the rope! I told the staff there that they shoulddon't let this happen but they did nothing abt it just kept saying oh no they have been in line! I was standing for almost 45 minutes in que and the line Infront of me was getting bigger than smaller and they say nobody broke the line! I even called mr Andy who was the rad there and told him but he was quite rude too found him arrogant as he was only speaking n hardly listening so I left without any pictures with my daughters fav characters!Also at the Hollywood hotel no characters came to meet kids as is expected out of a Disney property!they had no great activities for kids and the pool they had was also shut down!We felt rather silly booking that hotel because there was nothing to do!All in all a very bad experience and I dodon't think I will ever come to Disneyland again!,1
"very disapionting unfriendy staff ,take pics of you even askif its free them say yes yes inend you find out you need topayanyway wait wait everywhere about 60 min to go withyour child inside some disney atraction .nobody care you or your child cold faces no kindniss buttomline disney verydisapionting ",1
I have had the chance to go to a few Disney Park in the US and in France. I have to say the HK one is extremely disappointing. I would not recommend it if not for families with very young children.,1
"I'm very surprised the place was so crowded. Full of china people, especially from the countryside. They are damn rude, no manner and damn inconsiderate.....  The staffs there cadon't control the crowd, many tried to cut queue..",1
It's clearly for babies. The rides are so junky and getting old. The shows are not as good as they used to be. Period. The end.,1
"The pictures taken do not suggest it was a dissapponting and exhausting experience overall. I appreciate one could be very patient to show kids this attraction, but spending 40 50 minutes in average to attend any of those is too much, given their  fastrack  system diddon't work for some reason. Nearly 300 euro for 2 days tickets (2 adults   2 kids), far too much for this doubtful  enjoyment  in my view.",1
"We were told of VIP treatment for my boy who was celebrating his 8th Birthday in Disney. I tried getting more information via email requesting for assistant but took me more than 5 emails and 4 different persons before i can place an order for a birthday cake and make a reservation for lunch there.We ordered a Disney Birthday cake(taste good) and made a reservation at the Main Street Corner Cafe for a group of 13 people. To our disappointment, NO VIP Treatment at ANY OF THE RIDES; no VIP TREATMENT at restaurant; He did receive a 'birthday goodie bag' from the cake i ordered. BUT, would you consider a party hat, 1 sheet of disney serviette, 1 disposable plastic spoon and fork, 1 colouring paper, 1 balloon a Goodie Bag? Disappointing, very disappointing.My wife had to write in to express out disappointment BUT, the experience there already left us sour....Will we recommend Disney Hong Kong? My review says it all....",1
If you want to see shops full of teddy bears...1 restaurant and some carnival floats then go here.If you want to have something memorable then forget it...most staff cant speak english nor answer simple questions. We were told first that the characters were on a break so no photo opportunity....later we returned after eating at the time they told us and apparently they were on lunch....after the carnival there were queues of people taking 10  pictures each....We got as far as the path to what looked like a castle then went back to the coach area to return to the also awful hollywood hotel...then we took a taxi into HK to eat real food (which doesnt seem to be available in disneyland)At least we know not to return. ,1
"The park is old and small. It feels like being in a normal American makeshift funfare than in a Disneyland. Majority of the crew members do not smile and look unhappy with their job and role. Food is expensive and lacks variety. Everywhere you go, the park is a vacuum cleaner that keeps wanting to suck up your money instead of bringing joy and fun. It should not be named a Disneyland at all. The worst of all Disneylands that I have visited. Dodon't waste your money and time on this HK Disneyland and visit a real Disneyland in Tokyo, California, Orlando or Paris. This is NOT a DISNEYLAND !!!",1
"Since last year, we have been trying to make a trip to HK Disneyland from Beijing on my son's birthday as Disneyland is our favourite destination around the world.But the encounter on this day might have change our point of view about HK Disneyland.It was little past noon on the 27th of November when we go on the carousel in Fantasyland. Right after the ride was over, my little son ask if he can ride again and refused to get off the horse as any 3 years old kid having too much fun would. So I try to explain to him that it is not permitted and we have to get in line again. At this moment, I caught one of the attendants approaching and I turned to my son and said:  You can ask the lady here if you can ride again. I was expecting the young lady to use the normal friendly Disney attitude to explain to my son that he needed to lineup if he wants to ride again.But instead, she put on a stern face and said:  Of course NOT! At this point, although a bit surprised, I was still thinking that she was putting up an act for me.So I turned to my son and said:  See, you cannot ride again. Let's go find mommy. As you can imagine, my son started crying immediately.What happened afterwards was truly unbelievable for Disneyland.Instead of helping me a least bit to comfort my son, this young lady turned to me in a very rude manner and asked me:   You need to bring him down from the horse, and hurry up! In hindsight, it is very possible that this young lady has mistaken that I was asking to take the ride again. But I must say, even if that was her understanding, was that the way Disneyland treat a 3 years old birthday boy? What happened to the happiest place on Earth?I did not want to make a scene immediately since my son was with me. But I have managed to report this incident afterwards to the gentleman operating the ride at the said time. This whole exchange was conversed in Mandarin, and it made me suspicious if it was her bias against Mainland customers? I am a Chinese US citizen born in Hong Kong. No matter what her excuse was, I found it a truly shameful day for both my favourite destination and my birthplace.",1
You pay an entrance fee and then you have to queue for any ride!!! eventually you end up speding time and money in the stores...,1
"Hong Kong Disney land is the worst Disney that I have visited. The total land area is so small, the attractions are so little. The whole place is so crowded. The crowds there are noisy and disorderly. This place have no Disney Magic at all.",1
"For someone who has a deep love for the Disney brands, and who has been to both parks located in the United States (numerous times), this Disney Park was a huge disappointment. Every thing was wrong   even the half complete palace! Children were out of control. Parent were too busy playing on their mobile phones to pay attention to their children. I woulddon't recommend this Hong Kong Disneyland to you if you have been to any of the other company's parks.",1
I havedon't been to a theme park as bad as Hong Kong Disneyland. As usual long queues. Rides were poor and rough with probably only 2 rides in the whole park suitable for pre teens and myself who loves a good roller coaster ride. More suited for very young children.,1
"In short. Hong Kong Disney has nothing to offer for Halloween 2015. Rather go to Ocean Park.Disney went to no trouble at for this years Halloween.The last time we visited for the Halloween program was in 2012 when it was excellent! A scary Haunted Hotel and other fantastic walk through attractions. Lots of actors dressed up in Halloween costume and mingled with the crowds. A wonderful parade of ghostly spectres dancing in Main Street......sadly, that was not to be repeated.2015 offered some really lame entertainment. Ghosts Rising  is a dozen or so actors dressed in white. They walk out and then pose for photos with the crowd. Apparently they are acting out a story. This all lasts for 40 minutes I am told. We diddon't stay till the end, it was just was boring. The Haunting of Grizzly Gulch  has an old guy walking on to a stage swinging a lantern. Then 5 guys dressed in black wearing cowboy hats follow onto the stage. Next thing I see one of the Cowboys has a puppet horse...I had seen enough.The final Halloween attraction is  Curse of the Emerald Trinity.  It's the Jungle River Cruise, Done at night with a bit of green fog. Not scary and only done in Cantonese.I'm not sure what changed at Hong Kong Disney, but I will never waste my time to return for another lame Halloween. If they dodon't want to do Halloween for whatever reason, that's fine. But then dodon't advertise a Halloween program. My kids were so exited to go. We dressed up and left bitterly disappointed. Such a waste of time. They diddon't even turn the pumpkin lights on down Main Street. Very sad.",1
"Visited with a friend and her two early teen kids.Honestly the visit was a waste of money and time as the place is rather small with a small range of rides and quite boring.Food choices are very limited and taste terrible, they dodon't come cheap too.Left after 2 3 hours as the kids wanted to leave.Might work for families with very young children....",1
"The place is expensive, food is not palatable, the main landers have no clue what a queue is for. The rush from attraction to attraction and appear to be very rude folks. Ocean park gets you more bang for your buck.",1
"The day was plagued by problems. Firstly due to a buyout by Citibank the three latest additions: Toy Story Playland, Mystic Point and Grizzly Gulch, where closed at 16:30   this was communicated in a very jovial  to help you plan your day  kind of way around the park and was mentioned upon arrival. However there was no indication of this simple fact on the website.This was essentially OK because I was able to do multiple rounds of the rides in the soon to be closed areas. However there where more issue:Going for a serviced sit down lunch though was a true challenge: the only restaurant offering something substantial was the Plaza Inn. The food was absolutely horrific and took ages to arrive. The service did not pick up on this either and when I complaint to the server there was a blank stare and an  oh    no excuses where made whatsoever. All in all I wasted more than 90 mintes for 5 or so nasty plates of food, including a cold piece of duck and a  signature  spring roll that seems to consist only of rice paper without any filling. I asked for the bill and this took more than 10 minutes to arrive. After 15 minutes of waiting I put down the money and left   only to be chased by the waitress and a manager and was told I left too little money and should have added 15% for  service . When I told them what happened I was again met with blank stares and without any comment. Lots of other things where closed too including the Tahitian Terrace which had a sigh posted saying it was closed  temporarily , I went in anyway only to be told that this restaurant would open after 16:30   so why not communicate this timing properly with signage instead of giving no indication of what  temporary  might be?After queuing up for an ice cream and deciding and paying for two scoops only to find out there are only three flavors available is also something one does not expect when the website screams  refreshing flavors  you can cool of on at It's a small world ice cream. Worse: the mango ice cream diddon't taste like mango at all and was gooey tasting of too much uncooked flour and not at all fruity.Upon returning to Adventureland it turned out that the Jungle Cruise and Rafts to Tom Sawyer (as well as the Tree house) had also closed early: this had not been communicated at all during the day, and since I had focused on the area that was  advertised  to be closed early I was not able to do these attractions either. Attraction staff completely neglected complaints saying these early closings  where part of the regular operating program . The same was true for the railroad encircling the park as well as some character meet and greet areas.Staff did not really look they wanted to be there either, did not take pride in their work and overall morale was very low. There was not endless smiles, no small talk to guests who were first in line and needed to wait some seconds for their vehicle to pull up, there was no  thank you  hardly anyone who made eye contact with you. Totally sub par of a Disney experience, let alone comparable to Disney experiences in Asia or the uplifting and fun atmosphere at Ocean Park.Charging HK$500 on admission and closing 14 of your 34 attractions ( more than 40%) early   (e.g. before posted park closing time) is completely unacceptable and you are a completely delusional operator when you think this is  OK  to be part of your  regular operating day .After complaining at Guest Relations I was told I would be contacted via email: that promise was made more than two weeks ago and is yet to be fulfilled. Mystic Point and Grizzly Gulch are two of the best Disney rides in the world, but a good park experience is made up of more than the hardware, the software is probably even more important and this is what is significantly lacking here. I would not go again.",1
We have visited HKG Disney in couple. The biggest mystery was : how is it possible that even bamboos are artificial? In HKG! In SE Asia! I mean there are so much bamboo growing in this part of Asia that using artificial one is nonsence! Disapointing,1
"Overpriced, considering that after entry you need to queue ages all the time to try anything you want. Eventually all the parents spend the day in the shop to make their kids happy. Or at the restaurants. No more.",1
"This is our first Disneyland trip and what we have expected is way too high than what we've experienced!We havedon't seen Mickey and the gang! The Character Meet locations indicated in the map are all vacant, we went in at 12 NN and left at 9 PM and no Disney Character! My two daughters were so disappointed!Good thing we waited for 1.5 hours (under the hot sun), to see Elsa and Anna   the show was very good though, but considering the time you waste under the hot sun just to go to a ride or a show is not worth with the price you paid to enter Disneyland!All guests are wet with sweat! It is very hot with very minimal shades and blowers! And the queues are hyterical!So many food stalls are closed and the few that are open closed down 2 hours early!And the staff, I think they need customer service training! It is a very hot place with very cold people!Hong Kong Disneyland is a joke! Walt Disney should consider removing his brand in this place!",1
"its the smallest Disneyland and there are very few attractions,  not worth its money, too expensive and nothing to do.",1
"Ew, no! You dodon't go to HK for Disneyland. You can take the MTR line that goes to Disneyland and admire the Mickey Mouse shaped windows and handles. Save the entrance fee for something else. Like eating street food or going to Ocean Park.",1
"Never again! What a waste of time and money. The park is TINY compared to other Disneylands (we have been to four altogether) and the props, decorations ATC a very poor standard. This is the poor man's Disneyland. If you are thinking of here vs the U.S. or Paris parks, it's not even worth considering Hong Kong. Very disappointing. I'd only go if you happen to have a day free and the kids are bored and have never been to a Disneyland before. Dodon't take them if they've been as this one is Dismal land!",1
Went on a weekday with my daughter. Crowded.  A lot of people not queue uo properly.  The food was very expensive.  Not a fun day at the Disney.,1
Do not use Viator skip the line ticket purchase. The people at Disney do not know what to do. It took me 30 minutes in Guest Relations to get a hard ticket. I could have purchased a ticket and been inside in under five minutes. Save your money. This is a 0. ,1
"Took our daughter who was six at the time and she was really disappointed. Huge queues for everything, including loos which are not near the attractions. If you can get to another Disney skip thus one.",1
"So looking forward to this, but what a let down. We were going to buy a 2 day pass and so glad we diddon't. There is very little to do. Each (land) has only one maybe two rides, most of the show times clash and the food, drink and souvenir prices are way over the top. I always expect to pay a bit more in a theme park but this was just blatant gouging. I can think of better ways to blow $500 hkd and waste a day.",1
There was no Disney experience from the astaff at Hong Kong Disneyland. The food at Plaza Inn was disgusting and the service was none existent.The staff all around the complex had sour faces and no time for patrons.Save your money and visit the NGONG PING much friendlier people.,1
"$499 hkd per one adult admission, and on a super busy saturday and on a day full of rain. Only one restaurant catered to us Vegetarians and it wasdon't easy to find. Many attractions were out of service for renovation and there was not enough sitting   resting areas meaning you have to stand constantly; very tiring. The few benches we found were placed in the sun   Rain area with no coverings. Considering the millions this place takes in, you'd think they could provide covered seating. Wodon't be back.",1
"Spent the day here wish I could get it back, do yourself a favour and dodon't waist your time. If you have children under the age of four you might have a reason to go here if not save your money for real theme parks like universal studios or anywhere else for that matter. Please dodon't pay attention to the positive reviews of this place it's terrible and you will get better value for money on the Hong Kong railway system. Please dodon't pay any attention to the positive reviews of this place it's not the happiest place on earth far from it. ",1
"Organization in general is very poor and what should be a day of fun with family becomes a day of suffering and frustration. The only thing I have enjoyed with my kids was the parade and the fireworks. For all the attractions waiting time goes over 1 hour. While lining up there is no way to go bathroom unless through a mountain of people. You have to line up ages for everything, a coffee, an icecream, a bottle of water or a meal. One full day cannot get you to attend more than 4 attractions or shows.Ocean Park beats Disneyland 10 0.",1
"This was my third visit to HK Disneyland. I went the first few weeks after it opened and have young children, so have been back twice since. Whilst the kids will love it, the crowds here are out of control and quees to match. When you get on a ride they are very short and the staff are not typical Disney level engaging. They were doing training runs in adventure land not allowing customers to enter the raft every other time, which added insult to injury given the lengthy delays. I saw one set of characters (from Frozen) meeting guests for photo shoots and one piano on a tricycle in around 5 hours. The staff just dodon't seem interested in the patrons and were more interested in joking amongst themselves.No characters were walking around like I've seen in Anaheim and HK in the past.Very expensive way to access merchandise stores... That seemed to be what HK Disney was all about. We managed to go on two other rides in the 5hours, ate a very average hotdog standing up as there were no seats available in the food halls.There needs to be a limit to the number of patrons that are permitted at any one time (or a substantial reduction to the current limit) as HK Disney is poor value for money and not anything Disney should be proud of.Save your money and go to another Disneyland.",1
"Compared to Orlando, California and Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland is a really small parks. You won`t find a lot of the typical rides in other parks. There is no Cinderellas Castle, it is more like a painted wall. The worst is the PHOTOPASS: unlike all the others Disney Parks is that you have only 24 hours to retrieve and buy your photos, not the 30 days given in the other Disney parks. So we went all the way from Costa Rica, and we realized that we lost all our memories just when we came home. They must save all the photos more time like the other Disney Parks.",1
"This was my first time going to a disneyland and I never expected it to be that bad. Firstly, HKD is way too overcrowded and they dodon't limit the amount of visitors there is a day, I believe that 200 people should be the maximum since I only went to a couple of rides: space mountain ( fast track ticket ) , Buzz lightyear astro blasters, jungle river cruise, Autopia, It's a small world, stitch encounter and slinky dog spin. For me, the stitch encounter and the slinky dog spin was the worst because the stitch encounter was basically watching Stitch talk and having a chance of talking to him ( on screen, for children ) and I thought it was a ride, the que was horribly long ( 1 hour on a hot day ) The slinky dog ride was very bad either, 45  minute que to go on a dog ride ( 3 4 laps of a a circle ) which made the ride less than 1 hour. However, I do recommend Autopia, space mountain, astro blastersand the jungle river cruise. On the other hand, the food there was disgusting and dry which costed 98 hong kong dollars ( equivilent to   9.80 uk money ) What a rip off       . The staff had bad manners, the one i experienced was the one in the jungle river cruise. Somehow, they show disrespect to mainland China people since my family and I split the group in half because half of us wanted to rest and half of us wanted to go on rides, so they found a ride and they called us to go and when we reached there they diddon't let us through since they thought we were que cutting but my family was at the front of the que and they were talking disrespectfully to my uncle as his first language is mandarin but his cantonese is good. But, when my mum came and spoke cantonese they went silent and let us through. Here we can the see the discrimination between hongkongese and chinese mainlanders. Also, people from south west china have better manners than mainlanders so I dodon't understand why they think we are mainlanders. Im from the UK and find this a rasict. In conclusion, I found HKD terrible, I do not reccomend HKD to people because of the overcrowded visitors. The positive thing about this trip is that you get to watch the 9:00pm fireworks and get to LEARN YOUR LESSON. The park opens at 8:00 or 9:00 and closes at 10:00 but when my family arrived, there were a bunch of people already there. Also, be careful since you are at risk of having your children lost. From a review of a teenager from the UK.",1
"Park is ok cadon't fault it really. But the whole time being there had been ruined by those from mainland China. Europeans dodon't waist your time here, stay close to home and go Paris. Try to que for rides I not even joking mainland wild animals will rip you apart to jump the que. they'd use all kinds of ways to get in front of you. shame staff cadon't do nothing bout it but I do understand why. They rely on them to make money more then Europeans.",1
"Worst amusement park ever.  Huge parking fee (120 for motorbike), same for the entrance fee, and the attractions inside are crappy. Food isnt great but that's not what you're coming there for...  Not a good experience.  Ocean park is much better",1
"There are five themed areas within the park. Each section has one or maximum two high thrill rides, the rest are for little kiddies. There is insufficient seating for those who purchase from the take out vendors (forcing you to sit at an EXPENSIVE restaurant). All food is overpriced. Some staff dodon't understand English. If there were more rides for older children and adults, this could be a value for money destination. I must apologise as I am comparing HK Disney with Disney Orlando!",1
"No animatronics.. no nothing. The mini castle is a joke. When will Disney stop making money with this nonsense? They don t use the technology available today to create magic, as Walt used to do in the past. A forever gone era it seems. They can go on opening gift shops... they don t have the creative gift Walt Disney have.And in Hong Kong it s most noticeable. It s a shame.Take your children to the Science Museum in Hong Kong it s wonderful.",1
"We thought Disneyland is supposed to be one of the happiest place on earth but it is definitely not true in Hong Kong Disneyland. We encounter several rude and unhelpful staff especially in the disney shop inside disneyland. The sales staff display bad, unhelpful attitude when my wife ask him question in mandarin nicely. His attitude only improve when she eventually speak to him in English. We can feel the distinct discrimination to Chinese especially to those from mainland. But being in the service industry, this should not even happen. Having been to other Disney theme park in florida and LA, I must comment that the experience in disneyland hong kong is unexpected and disappointed. Your staff just spoilt our day. Lousy!!",1
"This park, according to people who worked there, was built with one segment of market in mind: the Mainlanders. The rides in this park, therefore, are not as exciting as the ones found in other Disneylands. The park was built so that people could merely take photos, and walk around as that was what the market research resulted. Save your money for a real one. The place is too crowded, and too uncivilized, and sanitation suffers.",1
"I am so glad that I have been lucky enough to go to the parks in the states and Disneyland Paris. This allowed me to compare this park to the others. Our family of 4 with two teens included have now been to all parks apart from Tokyo. Our least favourite park was HongKong in fact it was the bottom of our list by a long way. We disliked the food that may have been the fact that we prefer western style food. The small amount of western food available was poorly done in fact my daughter fed most of hers to the birds. The park itself was clean and pretty but small and the staff lacked personality. The castle was small and I felt lacked the feeling you get from the other parks. We did enjoy the Mystic manor and was my favourite ride, we also enjoyed the addition of the Disney characters in its a small world but apart from that we were disappointed with the rides. My children said space mountain was the worst one in all the parks they had visited. The merchandise available was also boring and lacked variety compared to other parks. If this is to be your first time at a Disney park dont bother save for a little longer and go to one of the better parks. As you can tell I was disappointed maybe if I had nothing to compare it to I would have felt differently.",1
"Lots of mainland tourists , even locals jumping queue,shouting,pushing. Screaming kids, total mayhem. Totally bad behavior exhibited by them. Brought my family, thinking it would be a magical moment. Food are heavily overpriced even for tourist standard, service provided by staffs are average. Most looks like students use finish school or waiting for results. Impatient work attitude. Totally opposite when I visited Disneyland & Disneysea Japan. If u really want the magical experience, go Japan.",1
"This is an abomination. Hong Kong has the amazing Ocean Park in Aberdeen, which is spectacular, locally flavoured and cheaper. Why would anybody come to this tired tourist trap of a place? I can understand locals coming here as a novelty, but any tourist who steps foot in this place needs their head examined.",1
"After Euro Disney in Paris. All those things you hear about park visitors pushing, shoving, shouting and screaming (and not just the kids), allowing children to wee into bottles, spitting, queue cutting, etc are all true. I had small children with me, and during the parade, adults just barged in and stood right in front of them. Perhaps the very hot and humid weather has aggravated it a lot more. But the whole experience is just unpleasant. I have to give a big kudos to the cast members. They are always there to help, very professionally managing situations, and always with a smile (even in the heat!). Tokyo Disneyland is the place to go if you are planning to visit Disney soon.",1
"It's so small if there was no line up you can finish the whole place in a few hours. The worse part of this place are the visitors. Many of them are from mainland china. They will elbow the hell out of you to budge in line and argue till there's no tomorrow and ruin your day. You will get stepped on, pushed, spat on, and disrespected every way possible. This place cadon't be any worse. Dodon't go with your family if you have any young or elderly. Someone will get hurt. I was full of bruises after a day a the park. One of the most strenuous day of my life for sure.",1
"I had high hopes for this visit as this was the first time I was on an out of country trip with my wife and two kids. My wife had previously been to the Disneyland in Tokyo, myself in California. Both of us had positive memories of those prior trips so we were looking forward to seeing our kids experience the same fun.Boy, were we disappointed. The queues were ridiculous   you can never get to a ride without having to line up for at least 45 minutes. And that's for just a 2 minute ride. Moreover, the whole time you're in the queue you have to be: a) alert for other visitors trying to jump the queue; and b) protecting your children from those visitors who do jump the queue. They were rude and showed absolutely zero consideration for small children.  Happiest place on earth  my foot.The heat and humidity   I guess that's just a side effect of the time of year we went there (August). For the overcrowding   maybe it so happened that it's summer vacation for many in the neighboring countries. Nonetheless I thought I'd mention it now so that those of you planning a visit factor these two things into your plans.So with all that rolled up together, the kids were wanting to leave the park in about two hours at a time (my kids are 4 and 3 years old). We went for just two rides in the course of two days   mainly because my family and I coulddon't stand waiting in a queue for an hour in the intense heat and inconsiderate crowd.The only saving grace for our trip was being booked at the Disneyland hotel, and taking advantage of the photo op with the characters at the breakfast buffet. They actually will go from table to table and you wodon't be constrained for time to wrap up your photos. The downside is having to spend more.I may consider going again if it's the cooler part of the year, and on a school day. But from my recent experience alone I woulddon't recommend it.",1
"If you want to be tortured and pay for it, you should go to Disneyland in Hong Kong, especially on hot and humid sunny day. I took my daughter as I wanted to celebrate her birthday, I did not even get a single picture with a princess (as she was just leaving for a break). ENDLESS lines for 2 minute long rides. We managed to go on 2 rides, then waited in line for junk food then searched for a seat to eat ...and left ....what a disappointment...We went to ocean park last week, and my kids had so much fun. This was the second and the very last chance I have given to Disneyland.",1
This Disneyland is by far the smallest of all. The place is catered for mainly for the Chinese mainlanders. I estimate that 90% of the crowd are from China. I have no issue with this but I do have an issue with overcrowding though it is not as bad as the one in Tokyo. The average wait in HK Disneyland is about 40  45 min for each rideI had visited this about 10 years ago and I did not notice any significant change in its attractions. ,1
They are rude and loud. Eat anything anywhere. I am a Chinese too but just can not understand how they can be this bad. If you have young kid then it is not a place for your family. You really dodon't want your kid to see or learn anything there.,1
"Reaching Disneyland Hong Kong was easy through the MTR. Wherever you are in Hong Kong through the MTR you get off at Sunny Bay and then on to the pink line to Disneyland.This Disneyland is very small compared to the ones in Anaheim and Disney World in Orlando (I have never been to those in Tokyo or Paris).I always describe my visit to Disney either in Anaheim or Orlando as a Prozac pill that will last me for a year. So in accordance, believing in the magic of Disney I thought this will apply to Disneyland Hong Kong. I visited the park on the 14th of July 2014 and it was hot, not hotter than Orlando, but for the life of me I do not know why I couldn   t tolerate the heat.The people there were loud, cut lines and had the most undisciplined children ever.The stands that offer ice cream, popcorn or cotton candy also had dried squid that smelled awful. And guess what? People actually bought that dried squid and ate them and fed them to their kids leaving a disgusting smell during waiting lines. We went to Disney Hong Kong as couple, my husband and I, we tried to stay tolerant but after an hour and half in to the park I wanted to leave. I was so looking forward to the fireworks but I got a massive headache from all the loud speaking people there. Either they were hard of hearing or I had sensitive ears. I did not experience the magic of Disney. I need a do over.",1
"not worth the time. I dodon't really mind if most of the rides are for kids but most of the employees are rude. They make an international company like Disney to have a bad reputation. I dodon't know if disney trained them that way or HK disneyland has a deteriorating service. Surely, I will not go back even if I have kids. Waste of money. even the food is ordinary.",1
"My kids loved most of the rides, but I could not stand the fact that so many people tried to jump the queue. Many people had absolutely no shame at all when they blatantly tried to pass you when the queuing line was moving. When you confronted them politely, they could even be hostile and shouting to you in Mandarin. Several times, I saw one or two people queuing, then at later time, 4 or 5 of their family members suddenly rushed to the front to join them.If not because of my small kids, I would definitely not visit HK Disneyland. My blood pressure rose everytime I went there. Staffs did not seem to do anything about it.",1

"Last December 2013, our entire family went to Hongkong for a much needed R&R. Everything was doing great as planned, until my niece met an accident in one of Hongkong Disneyland Rides. Due to a technical problem in their Space Mountain attraction, the guests were advise to alight from their seats after it moved a few meters forward away from the platform. The platform now is higher than the original position. Due to the ackward poisition while climbing out, my niece fell and twisted her ankle. She was brought to the first aid clinic for treatment. We requested that she be brought to a hospital for x ray shots and further observations. Now here is where our problem started. Together w  some of my relatives they transfered my niece to an ambulance on the understanding that she will be brought to a hospital. To our surprise, they were brought to a taxi stand, and the ambulance assistant advised them to get off and take a taxi going to the hospital. They want us to fend for ourselves w o any assistance from Disneyland officials. They want us to go to the hospital w o any help from any park personnel. We are tourist and we are not familiar with the streets and how hospital regulations are observed. We felt like we were being sent out of the park ASAP, to take out all responsibilities off their hands. So be very careful while in HK Disneyland, chances are you might get the same cold treatment.",1

"Made a visit to disneyland hong kong whilst on a stop over flight from the philippines to ireland.we arrived at the attraction in the afternoon after a 20 minute cab ride from the airport.My 3 children were very excited.we decided to look for the characters to have some pictures taken we soon came across goofy and my kids were so excited and looking to meet him and have there pictures taken,after 1 or 2 kids in front of us had there picture taken with the character we brought our children forward to meet him we were told by park staff that were in attendance in an aggressive manner that there was no more pictures that it was 6pm after pleading to take just one quick picture they were having none of it.we were totally unaware that this would be the situation that although the park does not close until 9pm the disney characters that make people go there in the first place finish work at 6pm .my wife and i felt very sad and upset not just for our children but for other children also. If we were aware of this we would not have gone.Millions spent building this place but the characters the kids love and want to meet clock off at 6 sharp.what a joke",1
"This is my 2nd time to the park since 2008 and there are new rides added. It was to be a good experience, but the in flux of mainland Chinese tourists during the Chinese New Year break totally ruined the visit. This specific category of tourists do not yet grasp proper manners, and in pursuit of maximizing their return on investment, they would keep pushing their way and cutting queue at every possibility. Common excuses are some family member at the front of the queue when everyone else are toeing the line. And when you dare to even confront them for cutting queues, they cause a major commotion, and challenge you to a fight. Shame on these Mainland Chinese tourists. As an oversea Chinese myself, I could easily observe these Mainland Chinese tourists are despised at for their aggressive behaviors, and the rest of the Chinese folks (Hong Kong, Taiwan, South East Asia, overseas) generally have way better manners. Disneyland HK really needs to implement stricter rules and penalty to these queue jumpers. They are a total nuisance to everyone else.Food by the way is exorbitant as the park totally monopolized the eateries and have little regards for taste. They would first scan your bags for food before entry and force you to dump any, and once you are in there, the food is 3x more expensive than normal Hong Kong caf  , and taste extremely bad. They have the worst food at the whole of Hong Kong! Total rip off from the park.If there's a choice of zero star, I would have given it just that.",1
"HongKong Disneyland is not a kids theme park., it is a jungle. HKD just want your money, they dodon't care about your satisfactions. They do not limit the number of peoples on the park, overcrowded  every corners ; the rides, the shows, the stores and...More",1
"Disneyland is meant to be the happiest place on earth. Well, the one in Hong Kong must have the most exasperated parents on earth.The kids alternate between brief moments of joy and long bouts of boredom and frustration.I had expected Disneyland to be crowded and the queues long, but I was relatively hopeful that Disney's vaunted queue management systems and methods would help alleviate that. After all it's their core business. This wasdon't much in evidence however. In Disneyland Hong Kong queue management appears to consist of telling the people queuing how much longer they have to wait. The information isdon't even up to date. On the Slinky Dog ride in Toy Story Land I was handed a card with the time I'd joined the queue written on it. By the time I'd reached the front of the queue 40 minutes later, and the card was taken from me to record a 40 minute wait time, I'd hazard a guess that the people joining the back of the queue would probably have had to wait an hour.It's true that one can use FastPass, to book a later time and return. In the rides I managed to go on however, the FastPass queues were about a quarter to a third the length of the main queue, so that wasdon't working either. It just delayed the main queue even more.Many rides were also not filled to capacity. On the Winnie the Pooh Hundred Acre Wood ride, my little family of three and an infant took up a car meant for six. On the Slinky Dog ride, an additional two adults could have squeezed into the car occupied by my three year old and myself. No wonder the queues are long.There were other irritations   turnstiles to exit some rides, for example. This just means that people pile up at the exits. The entrance to the Lion King theatre was packed with no queue management whatsoever, so when the doors opened, there was a headlong rush for seats. Perhaps the visitors aredon't used to queuing, but Disney employees should set out queue lines, remind their guests of their obligations to others, and manage an orderly entrance. My little boy was pushed and jostled, it wasdon't a pleasant experience for him.We arrived at the park at 10 am when it opened. We did Adventureland including Tarzan's Treehouse and the boat ride, we saw the Festival of the Lion King stage show, and Grizzly Gulch, and we went on the Slinky Dog ride and the Winnie the Pooh Hundred Acre Wood ride. That was it. We left the park at a quarter to four, and we spent nearly 2 hours in queues.Compared to Ocean Park, where the staff were energetic and helpful, and genuinely wanted to make the experience as pleasant as possible for their visitors, the staff at Disney seemed disinterested and focused on telling people about waiting times. It's a shame; the helpfulness of the staff would have made a great difference to what was ultimately a fairly horrendous day. Save your money, visit Ocean Park instead. It's more fun, more interesting, and cheaper.",1
"I'm extremely disappointed with Disney, as at great expense I sent my daughter and her mother to Hong Kong Disney from Melbourne Australia, as it was my daughters dream.She arrived there today(28 August) her twelfth birthday, to be told she's an adult, and they require more money. This has caused distress and embarrassment on the part of my daughter and her mother, and anger and disgust with me.Though every aspect of the trip was booked through a travel agent,and maybe it's a mistake on their part, the fact that Disney can classify a 12yo(Just!) as an adult is saddening.So much for a special start to a special day! Poor old Walt would be turning in his fridge, and Disney should be ashamed of themselves! Spread the word, I will be!",1

"Do not even attempt to go to Disneyland hk during summer. The crowd started in the train to Disneyland from Sunny Bay station. When you enter the park, all you can see is a sea of Chinese tourists. I think Disneyland never bother to limit the number of visitors into the park. Queues for rides are an hour or more under the hot sun. People are standing so close in a queue to each other that you can practically feel each other's breath. Eateries were packed with people and you have to even queue up to use the toilets! We only managed to get only one ride in the 'small small world' because we had to think about our three year old's welfare. We do not want him to fall sick during the trip. We totally enjoyed our hk trip except for the Disneyland. It's a total waste of money. My advice to parents with young kids: skip Disneyland hk totally if you care about your kids! My advice to Disneyland management: if you do not limit the number of visitors into the park, I am sure nobody will want to return to your park a second time.",1
"the park was so crowded, that all that we can see is a sea of people. all the rides have long queue of minimum 1 hour.

Small and disappointing. Really not worth visiting. The cable car to get there was probably the best bit.,1
The rides and all the other attractions are created only for kids. We went with an expectation of a similar experience as Universal studios SG. I guess for that you should try the Ocean Park,1
We went here on my birthday honeymoon and out of everywhere I visited in Hong Kong this was the worst experience. I absolutely hated it and it spoilt the Disney illusion. The mickey mouse train to and from was the best part of this experience.If visiting be prepared to be pushed out the way and people to queue jump and dirty looks when you wodon't let people past or you tell them there is a queue. There is no such thing as personal space either. Whilst in the queue the people behind were that close you could feel the spit on your back as they were talking.Save your money and visit ocean park!!,1
Too Small and Overcrowed with Obnoxious Visitors from the world's most populous country who have no manner and dodon't know what civilization mean.  The place itself is very small (too small) compared to other Disney property around the world,1
"Brought my whole family, kids, brother, nephews and niece to HKD land on Dec 17, 2012. Was my 3rd visit to the park. Off from Indonesia  a 5 hour sky distance from HK  we were all geared up for a full day of fun. Kids were looking forward to it, a full pay off after midterm exams. That morning, we came early with loads of kids' neccessities and my personal photographic gears. Kids' stuff included raincoats, spare clothes  as it was pedicted there would be light showers and for getting prepared for some wet actions. My personal photographic gears included those heavy full frame DSLR body and lenses  as my visit to the park woulddon't be complete without taking some great shots of my family with famous backgrounds such as Disneyland.I packed all those gears in one plane cabin sized roller bag, thinking that it would be too heavy to carry around. What an unpleasant surprise I received from the gate attendant that morning, instructing that I should take out all the heavy gears and leave the roller bag at the deposit counter outside the park at HKD 60 fee. It wasdon't the fee that made me upset, but the fact that they commanded me to carry the heavy loads without a roller bag. They even said:  You could take turn carrying them since you have 10 people with you!  What a statement! I thought to myself:  Doesdon't she see half of my group consists of children? What a thoughtless statement to have small children carrying heavy loads around while they should have fun riding and enjoying the park's variety of treats and snack? What disappointed me was that there was no precaution whatsoever made to me prior to my coming  whether on the website or at the tickets agency that visitors should NOT bring any roller bags into the park. I ended up carrying all the heavy loads around on my back. Imagine bringing those around for 11 straight hours! I could not enjoy one bit of my visit to HK Disneyland this time, even though still trying hard to take good pictures. We went back home with my back hurt. It was such a hurtful treat from the staff at Disneyland having such a mindless service to visitors like us. I do not know the rationale behind this rule. I could only guess  it could be for security purposes, or commercial purposes. The latter being to stop visitors for not spending to purchase foods offerred from inside the park, if they bring ones from outside.I do not know exactly their reasons, but one thing that had left me with after visiting the theme park, and that is being hurt and disappointed. For those with similar case with me, I suggest they call in first or better still, do not carry heavy loads into the park. You never know what they will surprise you upfront, when they should surprise us during the park experience with great times!",1

"I have been to many theme parks, this is the worst!They have more retail shops than attractions. You hardly see any other tourists from other countries except those from China. This Disneyland seems to be only suitable for mainlanders. This theme park has no queuing order, staff are not well trained. There is not enough shelter for visitors to take a break especially in Summer. I cadon't imagine if it's rain, where can the visitors go? There is no staff to control the queue, mainlanders are cutting queue as usual. The park do not control the total number of visitors for the day, it just seems over crowded. Waiting for a single attraction takes more than an hour. You just waste all your money and time waiting and waiting then you got to find out that they have a system called 'Fastpass'. Those visitors who got Fastpass can enter first. This is really ridiculous as who on earth a first time tourist will know where and how to get a fastpass? The park is small and for the services they provide, it just not worth the price and live up to the name of Disneyland.The MTR station also did not provide enough ticketing machine for visitors to purchase tickets. The stupid machine only accept small notes and coins. There is no staff to help you. You have to wait another hour queuing to finally get your train tickets. The train station equally sucks!Overall, you just felt like after they took your money, they just leave you to die. They dodon't even care if you had fun or can go home safely.My final advise; this park is only suitable for the locals and visitors form China. Dodon't even think about it.",1

"It will be difficult not to be disappointed when visiting Disneyland Hong Kong. The problem lies in people's expectation and perception of a Disney Theme Park over the years through various media, or through physical visits to actual sites such as Disney USA, Disney France and Disney Japan, so it is highly likely that one will have high expectation prior to the visit. There are many negatives when compared to other International Theme Parks:1. Small when compared to other Disney Theme Parks;2. To crowded (long queues when paying for shopping or waiting for rides);3. Too many mainland Chinese tourists (and many will consider them to be 'rude', i.e. jumping queue, sticking closely behind you when queueing, etc);4. Insufficient and lack of cooling ventilation equipments when queueing outdoor or in shops (should install water cooling fans in all strategic outdoor locations like at Universal Singapore) I have been to many Theme Parks all over the World and my visit to Hong Kong Disney in August 2011 was considered one of the worse for the reasons stated above. My family and I did not enjoy the experience, and we felt like suffocating be it indoor or outdoor due to lack insufficient of fans air con. We paid for the entrance fee, walked in and out without taking up any events or rides. My advice is to lower your expectation prior to your visit; be prepare to accept those negatives stated above; and you may find yourself enjoying the visit more than me. It's better to visit in cooler months. If you have been to Disney Japan, France and US, then you wodon't miss much by skipping the trip here, save the cash and time by visiting other Hong Kong attractions instead...",1
"Coming from a person who has been to Disney Land more than ten times, Epicot more than 3 times, and Animal Kingdom once; this park was horrifically horrible. This was not a theme park built with the intention of you going to have fun time on roller coaster and playing games. This was a park built only to have you spend money because the entry way was a line of stores. The rides, there are very few and they were not anywhere near the caliber of the rides in the states. No one would go to the parks In Florida and California with those rides. The characters were barely there, you would wait in line to take a photo, and the courtesy wasn   t even there to inform you that someone would be the last or that the character was leaving. The colors of the costumes are drab; the staff people were not friendly. It just left a sour taste in your mouth. If you have never been to a Disney amusement park you might think this park is ok or wonder why people enjoy going to the park multiple times. If you have been to a Disney Park and are one of those people who want to visit each and every one of the parks, skip this one! I usually go to the park when it open and stays until it closes but I was in and out in less than 3 hours!",1
"X3 kids, 7,10, 12, extortionate price, very small, poor rides, ages in queues, should have gone to Jade Bhudda or Ocean world instead, biggest regret and waste, kids agreed! Chinese music, very chinese, not disney like, didnt see characters, no Disney music other than in Toy story world. ",1
many people save for a lifetime to go to disneyland. dont waste time going to hongkong.in december 2011 there was no waterworld.absolutely boring. nothing much for teens to do or see.waste of my time and money. full of retail stores selling souvenirs of characters.yes sell souvenirs but is that the only attraction. the kids were bored..........11 years 9 years and 16 years old.,1
quite the opposite of the real world! never understood what people see in it!,1
"We were done in Disneyland in 3 hours, rides included. How magical. (We appreciate the lack of queue and crying children.) Considering that it takes some time to get from the city to Disneyland, it doesdon't seem that worth it to go at all. Skip this and perhaps try Ocean Park instead.",1
"Why else would the food be so disgusting? I had a bowl of Japanese noodles that cost twice what it would have costed outside of disney, but tasted like a bowl of instant noodles with too much MSG (imagine that). The burger was like cardboard and the fries were from a few days ago (or maybe it was just a special flavor). The smoke Turkey leg was dug out of the back of a storage room left forgotten since grandpa was a lad.Disneys in the US and Paris both offer decent food. Not sure what happened to Disney in HK. We left only after the fireworks, so we were all starving. But we would rather starve then eat the crappy food at Disney!!! Why does it have to be a lose lose situation? Give me reasonable food, then Disney can make money and I can leave with a full tummy!",1
"This Disneyland are full with some disgusting people.There is no LINE between all these people and we have to wait for every ride as far as 40 minutes to 1 hour to get a ride , and the wait is not WORTH it than a ride for 40 SECOND and about the MAXIM restaurant inside the Disneyland are THE WORST, THE BADDEST, THE YUCKIEST, THE JERKIEST, THE RIPPEST MONEY from all of my experience restaurant EVERRR!!!!I dodon't think I will go back in my life to this restaurant and I am regret to eat at this restaurant with almost 500 HK$ for NO TASTE NOODLE, and for 9 pcs BBQ pork skin, and 12 pcs BBQ PIG, and the Shrimp Ball order was came with no Fresh Shrimp taste at All, The Shrimp Ball was smells not right, and their bill come with 10 % service chargewith NO SERVICE AT ALLLL!!!! Horrible... and I will not be back...sorry that's not my good experience..",1
"Went there to check the place out on my own. Walked around the whole place (strolling   not hurrying) it took only 15 minutes   YES, I am not making a mistake   15 minutes. Obviously if you take your kids and queue for the rides etc... you will spend longer but the place is so small it can only be described as pathetic.",1
"We are absolute Disney fans. Having visited this Disneyland years ago and Paris Disneyland many, many times, I found our day at Hong Kong Disneyland very unimpressive. The western food in the restaurant was inedible and we had asked staff where we could get the best possible lunch. Then I thought that a chicken pie from the bakery would be ok... however, the filling was yuk and the pastry sweet as for an apple pie. I have lived in Shanghai, so am very accustomed to tourists from this part of the world, but the pushing and shoving that we received was really unacceptable. Getting hit in the head by umbrellas whilst watching the parade when not being shoved is not fun. It was really not worth the three train rides nor the entrance fee. I cannot believe that Disney headquarters allows this place to continue using the Disney brand. It is so NOT a Disney experience.",1
"It is definitely not worth the monney you pay and the time you spend to reach the park : the park is only 25 fo 33% of a normal park (ONLY 3 THEMES PARKS). If you want to go with the family, better go the Ocean Park.",1
"Dodon't get me wrong, I dodon't mind to visit a small theme park as long as I can enjoy it. Disneyland Hong Kong do have the potential. However, the visitors are horrible. They keep pushing and use umbrella in a way that dangerous to taller people. Worst, at the  Small World  attraction, there was a woman let her around 5 years old kid to take a poop on a plastic bag! Yes the queue was long, but it is not an excuse for such unruly behavior. My suggestion, apply strick rules on the park and train the staff to warn the visitor!",1
Loath the experience there due to its small size the rude mainland chinese who cut queues by sending a rep to every queue and an entire group cuts in to joins the single representative. Real ugly.,1
"Hong Kong is hot in the summer and very humid. Queuing up 45 minutes with two young children is not fun. And that is just to get in! Queue for tickets, queue for baggage search, queue to get in. If that how it is on the outside you can imagine what is like once inside. A 45 minute queue for a 60 second ride is not my idea of fun although some people may not mind this. Also, paying $285 for a 3 year old who cannot go on quite a few rides is just a rip off. The day is also marred by overpriced rubbish food and drinks, rude people pushing in the queues, jumping over barriers etc. whilst emplyees look on. This is not the first time I have been there but will certainly be the last for sometime. An hour there and back too just compounds the whole bad experience. Save your money and go to Ocean Park!",1
Give it a miss. A second day at ocean park holds more appeal. And costs half as much,1
"Hong Kong Disneyland is horrifying. We went there for the Chinese New Year weekend and the place was full of the most disgusting, crude, rude, and pushy guests. This is true for any attraction. There is no  line , just a wave of people shoving forward. We went all the way from the US to see this place. Dodon't waste your time and money.Some behavior:  Dozens of people doing their laundry on Main Street USA. These were adults washing their own things in buckets, using strollers to line dry.  Open Public Urination of grown men outside.  Sexual assault and groping of other folks in line.  Grown adults pushing toddlers over to get to the carousel.  Check out the photo. It is worth a thousand words. (Man squatting on child's stroller, while picking his nose, in red bow mouse hat.)  Pushy, Shoving, and Crowding in line  A man threw up some phlegm to his mouth, spit, and hit a food cart.  Parents telling their children to crowd in line so that they could join them.  Guests in their 20's, 30's, and 40's pushing elderly people over.The positive things are that the Maxim's restaurant was delicious. The public transportation has a Mickey Mouse train, which is very cute. They have a nice parade. However with such a poor line layout and no security staff enforcing civility, I dodon't see how things could improve.The best way to describe this is that my kid was horrified. She cried when we said we could go to Disneyland again. I now think of Hong Kong Disneyland as a way to traumatize children.",1
"Was there during the Christmas holidays. The entire trip was marred with sickening service and bad experiences. Was staying in TST for 4 nights before moving to the Disney Hollywood hotel. The hotel was okay. Something between a budget and boutique hotel. what saddens me is the theme park itself. The is no magic even to my kids. The staff there are mostly sulking (maybe because they need to be working over the holidays). Responses are mainly read from a script, sounding like a broken monotonous record. There were 2 highlights that I wish I would forget.....Rented a stroller for my little one. Was served by a frowning staff, handed over a HKD$1000 note but was given the wrong change (HKD$500 less) asked her and was given a good screaming!! she then cursed in cantonese and insisted that there is no HKD$1000 note with her and that I am stupid to have given a HKD$500 note. Highlight number 2 was when we were queuing for the 3D show when a bunch of Indian nationals cut to the front of the queue. Informed the staff and they adamantly inform that there is no queue regulations and continued to chat among themselves. The queue cutters then retorted that they are blue blooded and that is their rights to be in the front of the queue. The staff then grinned and nodded and continue their small talk among themselves.Worst nightmare ever....never ever go there.....better stick to Tokyo or US.",1
"We visited hk Disney on the 26th and 28th October 2010. Despite most people recommending one day at this park due to it's size we chose two because , when we visited Disney in LA in 07 we spent 10 days and weredon't tired of it at all. We also thought it would be fun to take our kids to the Halloween celebrations at the park, which were only thurs sun. The park looked just like it's LA counterpart, and almost felt the same. It kind of lacked something though. Rides are really aimed at younger children as the only big ride is space mountain ( and it had the shortest lines! Go figure). Immaculately clean, but there just wasdon't that wow factor I expected. The extra Halloween attractions were not at all what we expected. The haunted hotel, which we thought would be along the lines of a more temporary version of the haunted mansion in LA terrified our kids, aged 9 and 10. There were people dressed as zombies etc jumping out and screaming in the kids faces, along with a blood stained lady who ran at the kids with a man being hung (twitching on the rope!) behind her. Kids cried all the way through it and one had nightmares. That to me wasdon't the spirit of Disney at all and I was very disappointed. All in all, nice park, especially if you havedon't done Disney before, but to me lacked magic.",1
"I understand that normally people plan their tour with many hopes of entertainment and have fun of their tour especially when one think of Disney Land.We had been to many places of the world including USA, Singapore, India, South Korea and so on...one of them was Hong Kong and we had very disappointing time. I lost my full mood of the tour when my 11 yrs old son expressed his frustration at night when we were moving out from HKG Disney Land. He said,  Pappa it was total waste of time and money we had today .HKG Disney Land is worth not visiting. Their service is very poor, presentation is of no class, performances have no good expressions on the face of artists. I think they are more tired by end of the day so unable to present good.Their maintenance is felt to be not planned. Also, they even do not care to update such information on their web site. So that we can plan other day and do not miss such ride spot. They took 100% ticket charge from us and the day we visited 2 important attractions were under maintenance and one attraction we could not see because during all the scheduled time it was full. Their staff even did not bothered to accept our request to allow my 1 yrs child alone. So even if we missed it we do not care, but our child can appreciate that show................really sad experience.I recommend to have experience of Everland near Seoul, South Korea. Your time of 9 AM to 9 PM and money both will be refreshing worth of fun and joy. Being not a very known place to many, but an experienced tourist will realize what is difference in the service, presentation, quality of spots etc. between HKG Disney and S. Korea Everland.Bhautik V. Vaidya",1
The disney in hk is so small and quite expensive we paid 175 usd around for 1 day entry with 2 kids 4 and 6 yrs there was hardly any thing inside . seems quite a waste to go there ocean park was 100 times better than hk disney land,1
"Visited HK last week with my kids (10&12 years) who are really keen amusement park fans. We had high hopes for the HK Disneyland as we know how their other resorts can be. But what a lettdown it was: park is small, the only proper ride is a short indoor coaster! All other rides are for small kids, aged 2 8 years at most. The park is full of merchandise shops with overpriced souvenirs. For kids of age over 10 years, the park offers amusement for 15 minutes   what a rip off! Enjoy the plastic elephants and crocs in Adventure Land... The next day we went to Ocean Park   that we can recommend! Great rides etc, do not miss that. Avoid Disneyland.",1
"The park was a maaaajor disappointment for us adults. It only had one ride for adults   the famous Space Mountain   & that was it. And all the attractions were miniature sized! There was no variety in any of the services ranging from food to shopping. And everything was overpriced including the tickets. We arrived at the park at 10am, and left by 1pm. There was nothing to do there. A waste of precious time & money.",1
"Visited the park a little while ago   can not believe why people think it is a good park. The only worthwhile ride is space mountain   all others are rehashed, watered down and worse    MISSING. Can not believe why this park could be called Disneyland when a majority of the classic rides are missing.In my humble opinion, what constitutes a disneyland park MUST include:1. Castle. Check. HKDL has the smallest one! Just look at Tokyo and Orlando, not to mention the beautiful Paris castle. Even the smaller castle in LA is gilded and looks much nicer, even though it is 50 years older!2. Dumbo. Check. Smaller ride capacity than the Orlando version3. Small World   MISSING   It is available in different incarnations on ALL other disney parks! This is absolutely unforgivable.4. Pirates of the Caribbean   MISSING   This is probably the most classic disney ride   again, unforgivable5. Haunted Mansion   MISSING   Again unforgivable. Absolutely classic Disney ride6. Splash Mountain   MISSING   This is one of the best rides, unfortunately people who come to Hong Kong will never experience it.7. Big Thunder Mountain   MISSING   Another absolutely great ride missing8. Peter Pan   MISSING   Can not believe this absolute kid's favorite is missing. In other Disney parks, kids would queue up to 45 minutes to get into this ride9. Space Mountain   Check   have to say this is one of the best incarnation   the only good ride in the whole park10. Jungle Cruise   Check   this is a watered down version, no caves or temple for the boat to pass throughALL other parks   Tokyo, Orlando, LA and Paris has ALL OF THE ABOVE. Seriously, a park should not be called a Disneyland when any of the above is not present. This is serious deception on Disney's part. I hope they will quickly rectify the situation or continue their downward spiral. No wonder they did not meet the target attendence numbers. I would have travel there with my family at least once a month if they built it like the other Disneyland parks.Also many other attractions missing: Enchanted Tiki Room, Star Tours, Snow White, Alice in the Wonderland, Country Bear, Fantasmic, and ENTIRE SECTIONS COMPLETELY MISSING: Liberty Square New Orleans Frontierland and Absolutely NO ToonTown!   A very, very Dissapointed Disney Fan",1
"II went there with a friend and our two 3 years old children.I have been to all Disneyland parks in the world (Orlando, California, Paris and Tokyo) and this one is far from the worst in all categories:First of all, the staff is awfully rude and unfriendly.  The greeting  at the main gate resembles more a scary custom check than a welcome to a fun attraction park! Dodon't expect anyone from the staff to smile or to be cheerful there; they have simply not been trained for that!The service in the shops and the restaurants is equally horrible!And yes the guests, mainly Mainland Chinese are quite undisciplined but I was expecting worse and at least they were the only people who actually smiled at our 3 years old kids!The queues are long and the attractions are quite boring. It's not a children friendly place; so avoid this park, especially if you travel with very young children. On the bright side, the park is very clean. My advice, if you want to go to Disneyland, the best ones in terms of service and attractions are in the United States (Orlando   s Disneyworld No1 and Disneyland Anaheim No2).",1
My advice to others Keep away its not cheap and not worth the money. Not enough rides and waiting time per ride are around one and a half hours. I was expecting something Magical:0 but Horror :() Trust me you dont want to on a 35C heat during the day with your little kids. If you are in HK I would recommend Ocean Park much more rides and much cheaper.,1
"Was there a month ago with my three kids   what a dissapointment. My kids' favourite rides in Disneyland Magic Kingdom is: Haunted Mansion, Big Thunder Mountain and Pirates of the Carribean. Guess what? They are not in this so called  Disneyland !!! Totally ruined their expectation. Ended up leaving the park early and decided to never return. We got a second day free since we were staing at the Hollywood hotel   kids does not want to return for a second day and we ended up in the hotel's pool instead. If you have been to other disney parks, dont bother with HK disneyland. If you have never been to one, save up and go to a REAL disney park like the one in the US or Japan. Even the Paris park is lightyears ahead of this one.Missing:: Big Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain, Haunted Mansion, Small world, Star Tours, Peter Pan, Tom Sawyer, Snow White, Fantasmic and many more, oh, also no evening parade!!!Disney must think people in HK just like to walk around aimlessly in the park and not want to be in any attraction. Sad.",1
"This park is totally not worth your money. If you have a choice, go to the Tokyo park which is only 3 hours away by flight. The tokyo park has about 100 more rides and attraction than the HK disneyland and the cost is about the same!They should never call this park Disneyland. What a sham!",1
HK disney is boring  go ocean park  go la disney  but dont go hk disney,1
"What a waste of time and money. And to think I was planning on bringing by teenage kids. I went with a mate of mine who happened to be here at the same time. If you are over 8 years old, then there is nothing for you here. There is one roller coaster, Space mountain, that can only be described as LAME!!(my kids favourite word) with banked turns there are no G forces at all. And that my friends is it. Nothing else at all. No other rides that suit anyone over 8. The Dumbo ride is the next most thrilling ride and caters for anyone over the age of 2. Food is terrible. I just diddon't eat in the end and I live in Asia so it isdon't like I dodon't eat Asian food. The park is too small, the rides are hopeless, the food is awful, we diddon't hang around for the fire works at we would have had to wait another five hours and we were sick of it by then.If you decide you have to go, a morning or afternoon will be enough. I am so pleased I diddon't bring my 2 teenage boys from Singapore to HK and waste 2k on planes and hotels. they would not have been happy.One positive note, the park was nearly empty so very short queues. Not a surprise in hindsight.",1
"My husband and I took our 2 kids and it was the worst experience of our lives. Mothers take heed, you will be endangering the lives of your children should you bring them to this modern day Sodom and Gomorrah.First off, the park is poorly designed and incredibly miniscule. There are hardly any rides, and as you can imagine, with this few rides of course the lines are ridiculously long. Expect to wait 3 hours and more for even the worst of rides, though no  great  ones even come to mind. I truly believe that they built this whole park around the fact that it has Space Mountain and felt like it was enough to cheat their  ignorant  clientele into believing this is the real thing. This is NOT a real Disneyland, not the type I grew up with. This is at best an ultra mini version, and if anything, they should have made the ticket prices ultra mini as well because there is no way in hell the experience was worth the ticket price.But speaking of clientele, this may have been the worst thing about Hong Kong Disneyland. Before you think I am the squeamish type, my parents were in the Peace Corps and our family traveled all over Africa and South America. I grew up seeing decay and disease, and I can say I have never seen a greater cesspool of human waste and potential for the spread of disease as I did at Hong Kong Disneyland.My husband gagged and nearly threw up when he went for a drink of water to find feces in the drinking fountain.We saw a mother help her little boy with his trousers while he urinated next to a food stand.Smokers EVERYWHERE. Mind you, we're at Disneyland, not on the city streets where smoking in public is repulsive is enough. My husband and I nearly lost it when a man BLEW CIGARETTE SMOKE into the faces of our children!Mind you, we alerted Disney staff to these infractions and they DID NOTHING! It was unbelievable. It's like they were either very poorly trained or they were instructed to turn the other cheek.We found it irreprehensible. How park officials could let people smoke in public around children, blow smoke into children's faces, no less, and still consider themselves  kid friendly  is beyond us. Worst, this is DISNEYLAND! Yes, smoking everywhere is permitted at Hong Kong Disneyland.There were hundreds of other unsanitary and unsightly things that we encountered during our visit, almost too many to mention. We've never seen such outwardly anti social public displays ever in our entire lives. Wiping exposed underarms with bare hands and then smelling the hand, putting up bare feet everywhere on park benches and then rubbing and picking at the toenails, it was so disgusting. At times, you would think you were toiling away at some chicken farm instead of spending your holiday at Disneyland. The most shocking thing is that with the new outbreaks of bird flu virus predicated to happen any day now and possibly the re emergence to a more deadly and untreatable version of SARS, that there could be such horrid public sanitation and behavior at of all places, Disneyland!When you consider that SARS was originated in this part of the world from precisely this type of unsanitary behavior, and when you are among the 30,000 people packed into a space that is a third the size of Disneyland in the US, and people are urinating on the street and defecating in the water fountains, that you are in fact HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE to these type of diseases, whether it's SARS or H5N1 bird flu.What's more, Hong Kong Disneyland is like a hot box of second hand cigarette smoke for children. So either you are exposing yourself to the dangers of highly contagious fatal diseases brought on by unsanitary conditions and human behavior, or to preventable diseases such as cancer by inhaling second hand smoke when you visit Hong Kong Disneyland.Besides these factors, this place is supposed to be fun? Yes, but unfortunately, this place is as close as a family on holiday can get to the burning gates of Hell. DO NOT VISIT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND!",1
"I   ve been to Disneyland several times in the past 3 decades. This visit, I sensed the employees were disgruntled or unhappy. Very few smiles from the staff. In addition, the staff was prowling for people crossing the ropes while Fantasmic was on. Why do we need a Fastpass to enter to watch the Fan tasmic show when everyone has been situated and there is tons of space for paying customers without a Fastpass? See attached picture. Through the whole show, the entire space was unoccupied while there were 5 8 yr olds next to us straining to catch a glimpse.If you wanna pay $129 to stand in line for hours to ride an average of 9 rides that last 3 to 11 minute, this is the place for you. Disneyland has become so greedy that they overcrowd by double capacity just to make money without a care for their customers. It   s ridiculous to have minimal places to sit and rest with this large of a park. I highly recommend Universal Studios VIP pass over this mess.",1
"To all who comes to this happy place, welcome. Well Walts vision has been lost along the way over the past few years as this is my third and final trip to Disneyland. I have never experienced so many rude and obnoxious staff throughout the park as we did this time. If the staff are that unhappy with their jobs or pay then step aside and give a job to someone who wants to work. Disney has just turned into a massive cash cow who cadon't handle the large crowds but keep jamming people into the park until it becomes uncomfortable. We were fully aware of the large crowds of the Christmas period but disneyland promoted activities for you to enjoy and when we arrived at these events people were being moved along by staff, saying that you cannot stand there.Disney have made WiFi available in the park aswell and this just leads to people not watching where they are going because all people are doing is looking at phones instead of watching where they are walking.Do yourself a favor and go to Knotts Berry Farm, its a lot cheaper and not as crowded.",1
"I am really disappointed with Disneyland.Old, tired, over crowded and prices are simply a money grab.The fast pass is a rip off and only allows you to reserve a ride every 2 hours.Fast pass again is a money grab that allows people to pay extra money to jump the queue in front of other customers. This is so wrong on many levels. Honest paying customers having to wait in line longer while others jump the queue. I absolutely hate what the fast pass allows. It makes my blood boil as these rich people jump the queue ahead of me. From listening to others in the lines, others agree. Poor form!The characters are hardly seen, forget a photo, there are so many people.Admission price, really.. very over priced. 2 put of 10 stars",1
The max pass worked ok for Disneyland but not California Adventure. All the fast passes are gone within a few hours so it is a waste. The new system has doubled the wait times in the stand by lines because as they will tell you  fast pass riders have priority.  Under the old system you pulled a fast pass ticket for free. When you time to use it came you stood in a short line. While you waited for the fast pass time you stood in a line. Now you either stand in a line for fast pass if you can get one or you stand in a line with a few hour wait time. This was all a scheme for Disney to make more money and in the end it made things worse as far as wait times go.,1
"Came for Anniversary Trip, Rides were extremely long. Couple of them broke down. The castle was under Construction and no where does it even state this!!!! Some people come for the Whole Experience! What a huge Disappointment for the large amount of money you spent! Visited both parks and were extremely overcrowded! I   m so happy to see you are making it NO SMOKING, Maybe you could make it an Adults only Morning Admission sometime?? I have 6 kids and we went for a little getaway and gift to each and it was not even what we thought! My experience at the other park was the worst! I was knocked over by a little boy! Just horrible, it was a horrible visit! This truly is not the    Happiest place on Earth   !!!!",1
"Extremely long wait times and short ride duration. Posted wait time 150 min and ended up waiting for 2 and 1 2 hours at Cars ride. Fast passes out by 10 am. Some staff helpful but normally looking like they would rather be somewhere else. Food costs high and again staff    unenthusiastic    at providing assistance. We   ve been to Disney Florida, Universal Florida and California and have never encountered wait times like this. There is no entertainment, no updates on wait times or staff available when waiting in these lines, just the same tracks of music playing over and over. Very disappointing way to spend the day and lots of money.",1
No les recomiendo visitar Disneyland esta bien ocupado y las lineas vien largas mas de dos horas es ridiculo y los tickets bien caros uno trabaja bien dura por su dinero no es justo que cobren tanto. Espere mad de 2 horas para el juego de carros radiators spring para que me dijeran que se desconpuso. No se los recommiendo no es gusto para uno como papa tener que esperar tanto. really busy and long wait for rides. We waited 2 1 2 hours for radiator springs racer just to me told the ride was not working they gave us a fast past but still its ridiculous. We had 3 day park tickets so we went the next day and got a fast past to avoid the issue of waiting when our time came the fast past line was long and the wait was 45 60 min we could not wait as we had to leave.There was a lot of people and tickets are so expensive as an adult I would not want to visit Disney again your better off visiting Six Flags.,1
"We visited Disneyland in October November 2018We bought our 4, 5 day passes online and due to an error online, we were unable to buy the Canadian rate discount and were charged full rate (about at $400 error)Called Disneyland and told them what happened online. Talked to 3 different service agents at different times. (2 agents were rude, the last nice) All they would say is sorry, last agent said try the credit card company or talked to the front gate customer service.MasterCard said the transaction had already been processed Went to the front gate... More sorry nothing can be done here, go inside and talk to Customer RelationsTalked to Customer Relations, just more sorry we can   t do anything from another 2 agents I have been to Disneyland over 50 times since 1977, I WILL NEVER GO BACKThe whole experience ruined our trip, be Warned: Disney is a corporation and only cares about their bottom line",1
Cindy is by far the worst employee i have come across in the 26 yrs I have been going to disneyland. She was working at the red cart which sells corn dogs. She lied to us and was super rude when we found out other people had ordered the exact thing we were trying to (which she claimed was not possible). Seriously disneyland needs to hire nicer people if they are going to advertise disneyland as the happiest place on earth. So disappointed in cindy and the way she treated us.,1
"Oh my gosh!! Where do I even begin. We drove to LA from Northern Alberta, Canada. We decided to take our three teen preteen children. What an awful experience!! From the grumpy parking man (we parked preferred), man at the ticket office implying that maybe the max pass add on was too expensive for us, to the even grumpier older blonde haired lady wearing black tuque named Cheryl scanning tickets and taking photos. It was awful!! The Castle is under construction, so there   s a tarp with a cartoon picture of the castle. Definitely not the same! Everything in the park is way overpriced, unless you   re a Season Pass holder. Most of the rides were down today (Feb 20th) and some breaking down and the ride operators were so rude when letting us know that the ride was shut down. Seemed like they hated their job and I noticed all of the negativity and so did my children. We rode 3 rides and decided that enough was enough. We left in the worst mood and what a waste of money!! We spent $720 USD which was close to $980CAD for 3 hours! The staff needs a reality check and learn some workplace positivity especially when you work at Disneyland!! ",1
"I first went to Disney 30  years ago. It seemed a fair, happy place back then. I revisted last week and the attractions were the same. It looks like the place is stuck. The people visiting seemed stuck too. No healthy food, mostly expensive fast food. Long waiting lines, for tired rides. I hoped they had updated it is a small world, but no, it looks and felt sad and tacky. Go for a walk in the park or take your kids to the ocean. Dodon't waste your money on this place. Dreams are not coming true any longer.",1
"I know it is all about making money; but our day was ridiculous and a complete waste of time. Not only did we pay for the upgrade (dodon't waste your money) to help with the lines, but we got there when the park opened ... it made no difference. They need to limit the number of guests and that is the bottom line. How much money do you need to make in a day when people are waiting 2 hours to get on a ride. Travelling from Australia with my wife and two kids,including Disneyland in our trip was a must ... but it was the biggest let down of our holiday. I would encourage anyone to go to any other theme park as sadly Disneyland is simply not worth the money or the time that you waste waiting in line.",1
"My husband and I planned a trip with our toddler and infant to California for the first time in February 2019. My Mom mentioned that this was the quiet time for Disney and she bought my daughter a 3 day pass for her third birthday (so we also had to buy 3 day passes for ourselves costing over $400). What a mistake. We were done with Disney after just one day. All you do all day long is wait in lines. You   ll wait in line to get into the parking lot, then you   ll wait in line to use the elevator in the parking lot (only 2 elevators in the entire parking garage for a park that accommodates 44,000 people, most of whom have strollers or wheelchairs), you will then wait in line to get to security, and then wait in line at security to be screened and to have them dig through all of your belongings, then you will wait in line for the tram, then you will wait in line for tickets (if you didn   t buy them beforehand online), and then you will wait in line to FINALLY get into the park (all of this usually took about an hour minimum). Then you will wait in line for a ride (sometimes a 2 hour wait), then you will wait in line to meet a single Disney character (usually a 30 40 minute wait), then you will wait in a line for crappy overpriced food, then you will wait in a line to see one of the shows, then you will wait in line to use a single change table in the washrooms (there should be more than one change table in the washrooms at a children   s theme park), then you will wait in line trying to buy a souvenir, then you will wait in line to get back on the tram, and then you will wait in line in traffic trying to exit the park. This place is a massive waste of time and money. Never again. We   ll take our kids somewhere that our precious time together won   t be wasted.",1
Half of the attractions were closed when we visited yet we were still charged full price.  Very crowded and long queues for 60 second rides which were pretty ordinary.   Over priced and over rated.,1
"Long lines and unhelpful staff and unhappy employees, I don   t want to even waste my time writing the rest, it   s just not worth it.",1
for the price you pay for a hopper and fast pass its not worth it. unless you like to run back and fourth from park to park because fastpass only allows certain times for rides.  literally waste of my time and money,1
"We were very excided about visit Disneyland Park this was planned to the highlight of our holiday in US   but it was almost a nightmare...We choosed a weekday, in September   hoped less people because of school day...The end of the line was at Harbor Blvd before 9 o'clock... At security check we had to throw away our selfie stick, I dodon't know why because later in the park we saw that many people used. Finally we could enter to the park after 1 and half hour waiting (with a 5 years old kid). In the park everywhere had to wait 10 20 30 minutes for a ride   terrible!!! There were lot of people with stroller, finally it was impossible to walk without hit a stroller... And so on and so on. We asked a girl from the staff and she told it was a very strong Monday..Finally I can give only one advise to the management, please limited the number of sold tickets for a day   because it was a very bad experience for us because of the too many visitors.",1
"I recently visited the park and the most heartbreaking thing to see was the horses cart people all day. To think you can use other means to transport people, and the park chooses to use a horse. Extremely sad. And some carriages are petrol driven, should the park not consider electric?  The park is way to busy so it becomes hard to do anything with the wait period on average an hour. So in the end a waste of money and your time. Just a money making scheme. I personally will NEVER return. What a disappointment. ",1
"We took our 2 grandsons to Disneyland for the day, while in LA for a short stay to bring in the New Year. We paid in excess of $600 for tickets for one park ( Disneyland ) and we paid the extra for the Maxpass to avoid long lines. The cost was never an issue as we have been to DisneyWorld in Fla many times and realize that while it is expensive, it was always worth it for the memories and the experience. The only memories we are going to bring away from our visit to DisneyLand are going to be off outrageous wait times on every ride ( and that was after waiting for 2 hours in a line to get through security despite getting there at 8.30am )the frustration of not being able to use the Maxpass because use is severely restricted. Once we booked our Maxpass on one ride, we were not allowed to book another for at least 2 hours. The reason for this was never given and befuddles me. When we were able to book another ride on Maxpass there were no times available for hours. All in, it was a terrible experience and I can say we will never be back. Thank god we only planned one day for DisneyLand during our stay, otherwise the whole trip would have been a disaster. ",1
"Visited for Xmas with my 3 kids, aged 1 ,2 & 4 yrs old. Waited 1h30min to do the carousel. After that waited 1hr and the Q was still at 50% and my daughter said she was tired waiting foe the flying elephants, so we left the Q. We waited 1hr to order a coffee!!!!!! Every ride had notes on saying 75min , etc waiting time!!! The worst spent    2000 for a Xmas in Disneyland and paying    300 for nothing. Very poorly managed to reduce waiting times. Disneyland you won   t see us ever again!",1
"We paid 10 dollars per person for the fast pass and used the app. The app allows you to sign up for appointments for the busy rides but it doesdon't tell you that the ride is broken down for the day. The best rides were broken down including The Haunted Mansuon, Space Mountain and Star Tours. My father is disabled and the accommodations for people with mobility problems are poor. My family wodon't be returning. ",1
"I bought a 3 day pass online since there was a deal for Canadians. However, it was soooo overly crowded that my teenaged son couldn   t take it so we left after an hour! My husband and I went on our own the next day   we waited in a long line to go through security, another long line to go through the entrance. Once we got inside it was 4 hrs to wait to use our Fastpass,!!!! It was so crowded we bumped into people constantly. There was nothing enjoyable about this at all! We went back again with our soon at 0900 Monday morning to try again and the crowds built up pretty quickly. Already an hour wait for Fastpass...so we left after an hour. Disney needs to limit the amount of people it lets in! No one looked very happy to me. When people spend lots of money with prepaid tickets and travel far, they should be able to enjoy themselves!!!",1
"You wrote a review for Disneyland Park 2 minutes ago You buy a ticket but when you get to the entry, they REQUIRE you to have your photo taken. Now Disney's facial recognition database has your picture which they can use or sell. Go to Universal or go to the beach!!Also, no discounts for nighttime entry as they used to. Means you pay roughly $30 per ride, since in 4 hours you might get on 4 rides if you are lucky. NO FAST PASS if you enter at night because they already gave the slots away earlier.",1
"I visited Disneyland on October 19th and 20th. I normally visit during the summer over the for two three days for the Fourth of July. I love the fireworks and it has become a family tradition. I am the Disney fanatic of my family and I am the person in the family that ensures that each child gets a trip to Disneyland or Disneyworld. I have noticed over the past 10 years or so that Disney's service, food and crowds have all gone through marked change and not towards the positive. On this particular trip I flew my sister, brother in law, brother, son and toddler niece for a weekend for my niece's first Disney trip. I had not visited in the fall in some years and was not prepared for the crowds. When we arrived from our walk from our hotel the security line was almost to the main entrance on Harbor boulevard. We survived the hour wait to get to the security station by entertaining the two year old between the five of us. When we finally got in we had to wait in another almost hour long line to get the DAS for my son. He has a medical condition that makes it inadvisable to stand in crowded lines in close proximity with other people. We had used the DAS on several of our other trips to Disneyland and found the Disneyland the best out of all of the places we had visited including DisneyWorld and Universal Studios. This is a large part of why I continued visit Disney even after he went through a life threatening experience. He loves Disney just as much as I do so I try to find ways to make sure he can still visit. Both parks were super packed and we quickly learned that everything was abnormal on this visit. Two members of our party kept falling off of the DAS (they told me they were having glitches with the system that day). The lines were ridiculously long; like Christmas time long (e.g. Pirates was a 180 minute wait). I rode a total of four rides between the two parks the entire day. Child Swap was also not being utilized in ways that it had been previously. We were told that one parent would have to wait outside the ride and then wait in the fast pass line by alone in order to ride (which made for double the time and was no longer child swap). So my sister and brother in law were able to ride a total of two rides each. The lines for every restaurant, quick service etc. were tremendously long. Overall the entire trip was a lot of standing in line with little to show for it. I am a Disney veteran and have only experienced lines like this during Christmas and New Years at DisneyWorld. When I go during those times I already have the expectation that I will not really be riding rides, I go for the Christmas activities and decorations. This trip was, unfortunately an expensive mistake. This was my first Disney experience where I had regrets for visiting the parks. It was a disappointment all around. I did talk to Guest Services (waiting in line again) about my initial issues with DAS not working. I also wrote to Disney about many of the numerous things that went wrong while I was there that I have not recounted in this review but have not received any response (which is not Disney like) They are normally the gold standard for guest service. This felt like an alternate reality Disney experience for me and I sincerely hope it is not indicative of a  new Disney normal .",1
"Not sure what   s going on here , but in the two days we were here the staff where very crabby.. I   m not sure what   s happened but almost no smiling , and just a series of barking out rules !! And that was all over the entire park .. The energy of the staff has changed dramatically.. ",1
"I was prepared for the fact that the original park is substantially smaller than the Magic Kingdom in DisneyWorld. However, I found the park in the middle of October to be extremely crowded with entirely too many strollers (single and tandem) blocking up the aisles. I am older, but not a codger. However, Disney needs to limit the number of guests into this park. One could not find a place to even sit down. Also, the lines for the rides were ridiculously long as were waits for food. I realize that many, if not most visitors are local and many have annual passes. However, for those of us who have come a long distance to visit, the park is a turn off. Quite frankly, if this had been my first visit to a Disney theme park, it would have been my last.",1
"Hugely disappointed. Diddon't meet my expectations. Been to HK Disneyland last 2005 and October 2018. I thought Disneyland Anaheim was way much better since it's more expensive, much bigger and prides itself as the  original . But it's not! The 9:30pm fireworks show was suddenly discontinued, with no given reason at all! We waited inconveniently standing for an hour inside a roped area, for the fireworks show to start with all those excited people who travelled from all over the world, only to be cut abruptly. Big letdown! My senior parents looked forward to the stage shows. Sadly, we were so bored. The railroad train was so boring and a huge waste of time, nothing substantial to see. Queues for the attractions were so long that you'll lose all the patience still left in you. The Pixar Play Parade, hmm just ok. I wanted my parents to experience mickey mouse, donald duck, cinderella, snow white, lion king, aladdin, and the gang. My parents dodon't know those pixar characters. Suggestion: why not make 2 sets of parades instead, to cater to all your customers since you mentioned you're a family oriented, recommended for all ages, happiest place on Earth? Fantasmic was really nice but, having no available tickets left, we were pushed to an overcrowded area, standing uncomfortably for an hour with very limited vision to the show. It was shown just twice, to think that there were hundreds of thousands of paying customers and I'm sure at least 80% of them wanted to see Fantasmic. Disneyland Management, that's not rocket science, right? Mark Twain Steamboat River Cruise Tour was a big joke! It's a small world was closed for refurbishment. Pixar Short Film 3D was the only bright spot that happened to us last 11.2.18 My mom wanted to have a picture taken with Mickey Mouse. But they do not want to, that's why my mom was trying her luck to chase that fvcking unaccommodating Mickey Mouse mascot and his uncompassionate handler. Totally not worth it. Hard to recommend to my friends, family, relatives, co workers. So unmagical.",1
"I was so looking forward to visiting Disneyland. I was very let down. Long queues, overpriced food and drink, broken down rides   where to start. I think when one has to queue one and a half hours (not kidding) in Mickey   s House for a photo questions have to be asked. Why is there not more than one Mickey Mouse for a photo. Why not have 3 or 4 rooms with Mickeys in for photos? Why is it when you queue outside for a photo with a character all of a sudden told are told    sorry no more photos, Pluto has to go and have a nap, but he   ll be back in 20 minutes   . They should have a cut off point long before, instead of making you wait only to be told no photo. Don   t get me started on the price of food and water in this joint, again a total rip off. Then we get told, sorry no fireworks tonight, the crowd is too small. Blimey I   d hate to see a large crowd. Unacceptable, if the say fireworks they should have fireworks. Then we get in the Haunted House and the thing breaks down 2 minutes in. We have to wait 30 minutes to be let out, no apology   nothing. This place is a complete and utter shambles, run down, tired and in desperate need of a new CEO who has passion and foresight to get the place running efficiently again, Unfortunatey because this is the original Disneyland the crowds will keep coming so this place will never improve. I will never ever attend another Disneyland anywhere in the world. My childhood dreams have been shattered forever.",1
"Waiting in line for 30 min to see Mickey. Was given photo pass and told photos are free to download. Card says photos are unlimited to download for $10 max pass charge. Exited park at 10pm and went home. Tried to get photos in morning. Found out the window to buy MaxPass closed at midnight previous day so MaxPass unlimited photos for $10 is no longer option. Photos are offered to download free but there is a watermark over image and they are low resolution. Price for photos is now set at $20 each. Called in and they offered me all 6 photos for $79 dollars. This is a classic    Bait and switch   . Very dirty dealing Disney. You are tricking Mickey out from what was a honest mouse into a greasy profiteering rat. Exactly as if I went to my favourite restaurant at 11pm on my birthday. Restaurant policy is patrons eat free after 11pm on their birthday. I order a drink, appetizer, my free meal and desert. The bill comes after midnight and it   s for the full amount because I actually ate the meal after midnight and free birthday meals are only on your birthday. It says this on the fine print on the back of the menu! Didn   t you read the fine print? The restaurant knows this and expects this to happen but advertises the free meal as bait and switches when they offer the bill. ",1
"My family had been to many Disneyland and Disneyworld visits over the past couple of decades. My kids are now all teenagers. Really made the mistake of not checking the crowd tracker websites before booking.Spent close to $800 for a family of 4 for a one day park hopper with the online Fastpass option. Apparently, Oct.6 was so crowded that their Fastpass app crashed by 11am. I was not planning to drag my family around the park getting paper Fastpasses. Even the Guest Services near the entrance had a 1 hour line of guests complaining about the Fastpass app trying to get refunds. It's been 2 weeks and my email request for Fastpass option refund has been non existent.Our family ended up going on 3 rides total. Can you imagine a 3 hour wait just for Haunted Mansion? I personally saw people just scan their pass and scoot around the Fastpass crowd. I personally heard from some of the guests in the Fastpass lineup that that some where just scanning their hand and getting into the Fastpass lineup with no valid Fastpass. There is no visual scanning indicator or second scanning station like Disneyworld. Just ridiculous. Unfortunately, will be our last time for Disneyland California.",1
"this was my 3rd visit to Disneyland with my family, always had a wonderful time, unfortunately, this last visit was spoiled with the fact I had my money stolen out of my purse which was in my handbag at the security screening by security staff, please try not to be alone, especially once it starts to get dark, try and keep your money on your person, hope this helps and it doesdon't happen to you.",1
"I went to Disneyland on 10 13 2018. I am not new to Disney, I have been to Disneyland at least 10 times, Disney World 6, and to the Aulani Resort once. Let's start with the drive in, ... waited in line for 40 min to park.... from parking it is a walk to the tram which we had to wait 3 trams before arriving at the park. We already had tickets but the line to get in with tickets was about 15 minutes. It was so crowded that there were 2 3 hrs waits for most attractions. Fastpass was either not available or available during the 11pm 12am slot. There were three extremely rude Disney staff there. I had NEVER experienced that. One staff was yelling so loudly in the restroom the bday girl had to hold her ears and looked terrified. Three kiddos between the ages of 5 9 (one bday girl age 5) were unable to do more than 4 attractions in 10 hours. Navigating through the park was like driving on the 405 during bad traffic. It was not only crowded, it was like a can of sardines. Awful, never experienced this before and if there are many days like this now in the park, there will eventually be less customers. When the day is so overcrowded ....as this day was, admissions should be limited so some enjoyment can be had from families spending  magical  funds. No so. cal discount, no one day discounts. AWFUL. Disney is does NOT provide the  mgic  and happiness it once did. :(",1
"We took our two children to the Disneyland Park and was most disappointed with the lack of directions around the park. There should more signs to direct you to various parts of the park. Each time we have to ask the staff for direction. Unfortunately we went on a Sunday and the crowd was horrendous. The wait for each ride was more than 40 minutes. The park should limit the maximum number of visitors each day so that the wait will not be that long. Our six year old child had enough after four hours in the park. We paid about $5.00 for a small bottle of water. This must the most expensive bottle of water in this planet. The entrance fees to the park is very expensive considering all the queues for the rides. In the four hours at the park, we managed three rides. With the entrance fees of $117 for adults and $110 for children over 3, this work out to be about $40.00 a ride. Disneyland Park is most overrated and not the time and money in the park. Also the equipments of the ride are getting old and worn. C KOK. (SYDNEY)",1
"It is sad that overcrowding and greed have basically ruined one of the (previously) best places in the world. The bottom line is that there are too many people in the parks, the lines are too long, and you can barely move. The Walt Disney Company   s brilliant solution: charge you extra money to use their    maxpass   . That system allows you to make fast pass reservations on your phone. Essentially you pay extra to get access to the fast pass system to save time. You can also get new fast passes quicker than if you don   t buy the maxpass. More money for the Mouse and you get a small break from the crowds. Then the system breaks down   no refund offered. At that point you can wait on another line for 30 minutes for a single fast pass to    make up    for the fact that the maxpass you paid for is broken. Then all of the rides are backed up because the system is broken. So you get in line and wait, because well you   re here and you paid, then a mumbled announcement worse than a New York subway car sounds overhead. After standing still for a few minutes you understand that what has happened is the ride has broken down while you have been waiting and there is no recourse other than to accept you just paid to do nothing for the past 90 minutes. At that point you realize that you just paid almost a $800 for a 2 day visit to the parks (with a broken maxpass) to wait in line for a broken ride   which essentially amounts to Goofy holding your arms behind your back while an obnoxious Orange County teen spits in your face. Meanwhile you try to think back to the great memories you had when competent humans actually ran this place. As for the people running it now   they should be shown the door, because it   s one thing to overcharge for something that   s a fun memory filled day, it   s another to provide an awful day of nothing. As a long time Disney fan and visitor it saddens me to say that Universal Studios has finally surpassed Disney as a total, well run experience. ",1
"its smal, old and dirty. construction, rubish and faded colors everywhere. i was in other disneylands and this one is simply bad. it doesn   t deserve the name disneyland..   go in hollywood stuidos!! trust me!! so much more worth for the money!!",1
"If you are exiting the Disneyland park and want to take the tram back to the structure... make sure you make a right versus making a left to the  parking shuttle . We made this mistake and instead had to enter the park in a 30 minute line at 545pm. There are no real signs and after taking to customer service and the police officers at the gate, they say this happens often and there's  nothing  they can do about it. Thank goodness we have season passes or we would have to pay a new fee to enter again. Truly disappointed.",1
"This is a hard review for me to write since I have been to Disneyland countless times over the years with my daughter (who is now 11). I have a lot of respect and admiration for the creators, artists, and innovators of Disney movies and attractions. These men and women are truly inspiring. Walt would be proud. Who I dodon't have a lot of respect for are the greedy corporate shills that have taken Walt's vision for Disneyland and tossed it out the window in the name of profit maximization. It's pretty ridiculous, and last weekend's trip to Disneyland will be my last. Here are a few cold, hard truths about Disneyland:1) Way too crowded all day everyday. There is no off season.2) Ridiculously long waits for rides (because it is too crowded)3) Fast pass system inefficient (because it is too crowded)4) Obscenely expensive everything (all goods made in china cheap quality)5) Terrible food (minimal healthy choices stupid expensive)6) Terrible value for the amount of $$$ spent (you pay to stand in line)7) People are herded around like human cattle (it's disheartening to watch)8) There are lines for everything (and I mean everything)Overall, I cadon't imagine why any would want to drop hundreds, and even thousands of $$$ to essentially stand in line all day for a few minutes of fun. It just doesdon't seem worth it. The only ones benefiting from this system are the suits. That is it.",1
"I will never visit Disneyland again. To start off I waited in line for 40 minutes behind 5 people to buy a ticket. Once getting to the window I had a ticket person ask me stupid question after stupid question for 10 minutes before telling me I had to go to a different window. Once I got to the other window they tried to also tell me to go to another window. 1 hr. later I finally purchased the ticket. The park was supposed to be limited on people for Mickeys Halloween Party and the place was packed with people it was almost impossible to walk through. I went on Pirates of the Caribbean and The Haunted Mansion rides with my family and both rides were stalled and backed up. After all of that and spending $1k between snacks, shops and tickets one of their awesome cast members(dripping with sarcasm) used profanity with me. So thank you I'll find a better place to go for Halloween next year. Universal Studios here I come at least they know how to treat guests. Disney you have disgusted me and this is not the 1st time.",1
"Big Disney fan my whole life. I've been on multiple trips to Disneyland, Disney World, and Disneyland in Paris throughout my life. I loved them all. Our last trip to Disneyland (September 2018) was a complete nightmare. We picked one of the lowest seasons of the year, knowing that some rides and attractions would be closed. It was worth it for us because we thought we would be avoiding big crowds.Instead, we found many many rides closed, AND the biggest crowds we have ever seen there. Incredibly hard to walk around and get anywhere. Long lines at all the rides. Families stressed out and rushing all over the park. Horrible, horrible atmosphere.The magic is completely GONE. You cadon't even appreciate the beauty of the park because people are in the way. People are EVERYWHERE.If anyone remembers the magic and the music and simply strolling around and enjoying everything in sight (during low season), that is gone forever.All we found were stressed out moms, sweating and pulling their kids all over the park, racing to get to rides before everyone else did. If you dodon't rush, you're doomed.Remember when you would run into characters and actually be able to spend some time with them? That does not happen anymore. If you want to spend 3 seconds with Minnie, stand in line for at least 20min. If you're lucky, you'll get to her. Normally you wodon't, and have to wait some more for the next character. If you want to say hi to Captain America or Spiderman or Black Panther, be prepared to wait in line for 40min or longer.This is LOW SEASON, people. I cadon't even imagine the park being fuller than it was. It seemed impossible to us that more people could fit. But when we went, crowd levels were at 2 10!!!!Cast members are no longer kind and warm. They are all completely stressed out and rude and even mean. No wonder. Their job of keeping things together is very hard.Horrible, horrible and very disappointing experience for my whole family. I had spent years telling my kids all about the magic of Disneyland, and none of it is left.If Disney doesdon't limit crowds somehow, I dodon't think we'll ever be going back. The park is beautiful. The rides are great. The crowds are the problem. They create the stressful competitive rude atmosphere that makes everything feel like a big fat race.",1
We   ve visited Disneyland Paris Several times and Disneyworld numberous times. But since moving to Los Angeles Disneyland which you think should be the leader pales in comparison. For a start it   s a real drag to get there from LA in traffic but hardly the parks fault. The problems start with the jobsworth attitude and impersonal service and how miserable employees are and the sheer magnitude of people they let into the park. This time though really takes the biscuit and we aren   t even going for another 2 weeks. My older daughter wanted to save and pay for our 3 adopted kids to go for Halloween. She saved up all summer and we helped her out.Then my 8 year old broke her leg and will be days away from getting her cast off when we are due to go. We imagined that Disney would let us change the date as there was still availability.But they will not budge they say we need to pay again and donate our existing tickets! This will be our last visit to Disneyland we will make the effort to go to Disney world next year where we know we will have a great experience.I might add that we were able to have Great Wolf Lodge allow us to cancel our booking. Other relatives from the U.K. who are meeting us there Were all able to change their plans but Disney is so focused on the bottom line that all they see are the $$$$. It   s a great shame and surely does not honor the great man.,1
"As said in your own TripAdvisor page  it's the happiest place on earth! Well I have to say that this experience was a massive disappointment and when compared with our experience at Universal just appalling.In this land of magic and dreams we found all the staff to be miserable and unhelpful they just looked so depressed and like they didn   t want to be there, they didn   t make us feel welcome and with me being blind I received no support at all be it getting on or off rides or help with queues.In our day we managed just 4 rides yes just 4 rides, it was way too overcrowded we knew that in August it would obviously going to be busy and hot, but there was no shade whilst waiting for rides and very minimal shade whilst walking around the park, in one queue we were in a lady fainted due to the lack of shade and heat. Many queues were 45 80 minutes long which doesn   t help. Another issue that made things worse was that the fast track queues had such an impact on everyone more of them were getting pushed along leaving everyone else behind. I don   t have an issue with people paying the extra to get ahead, but Disney really need to control numbers here as it significantly penalises others.Out of the four rides we went on at Disney, I would say that the Space Mountain rollercoaster is best and not to be missed, that   s if you can get on. As you would expect the gift shops are pricy, as is food and drink (although comparing favourably with similar attractions), it just seemed to take the mick being charged a further 20 dollar for parking on top of an already pricey 97 dollars for a ticket.This was a birthday treat and first visit for my partner, who was extremely disappointed. I love Disney Florida but I just cannot recommend Disneyland California at all and I am sure Walt Disney would be mortified if he could see his creation today!",1
"Disneyland used to be one of our favorite places to go. Now is awful. Starts when you get off freeway then get taken all around the place as the signs are awful and traffic even worse. Terrible the way they have reconfigured with all the construction, etc. making it hard. Used to be got off freeway and wend straight into parking. No more and good luck trying to follow signs. When you finally get to parking lot is nowhere close and you get to pay $20.00. They park you in so tight can barely open your doors. Of course did not stop people next to us from putting their doors into our car. Then you get to walk almost quarter mile to wait in line for a shuttle as you are so far away cannot walk to resort or take monorail, etc. anymore. You get to stand out in sun and wait. We waited over 40 minutes to get on. The bus is at least air conditioned but they cram you in like sardines. After 15 minute ride you get dropped off and get to walk to multiple rounds of security where you get rudely treated by security. Minimum wage security with attitudes. Felt sorry for person in front of us. They are awful and make your day start out great (sarcasm). Now finally in get to deal with long lines, high prices, strollers slammed into you all day long. They do not even shade the lines or have spray water like Universal Studios, Knotts or Magic Mountain to name a few. Of course for their workers they do but forget their guests. Rudest people ever and to top off when we returned to car our hubcap was stolen. Of course not their fault so $20 gets you nothing as no security or anyone trying to help or make your visit enjoyable. Awful place now so save your money!!",1

Totally Misinformed, No one ever told use the total Hotel was under construction.I tell everyone never goI'm so disappointed it's taken me forever to send this.It's not Walt Disney4.",1
"The park was extremely crowded. Adding to the frustration was that Disney was operating some rides at half capacity, resulting in epic long lines. Food was mediocre and incredibly overpriced. 30 minute minimum wait for a sit down dining experience. Very trashy guests (locals?) were on their smartphones during dark rides, ruining the experience. Had a 3 day park hopper ticket. After 4 hours left and flew home 2 days early because Disneyland was such a bust.",1
"I am definitely going to seek legal retribution, refund just wodon't do it.FastPass MaxPass  what a rip off!No mention of only 1 ride, every 90 min when spending $800 on these tickets for a family of 4. By 4pm, no more fast pass entries for rides such as Space Mtn or Indiana Jones   what a rip off!!!Most of the rides are the same crap from the 60s 70s...Disney   ever hear of Lilo & Stich, Lion King, Moana, Little Mermaid, Madagascar???Because no sign of anything slightly recent or known by kids born in the past 40 years.Terrible disappointment, and will make a special effort to warn others from wasting their money.

"Having been to Disneyworld Florida and France I was expecting the original site to be amazing   but it   s like it has been left behind in the 1980   s! Poor selection of rides, very few suitable for anyone over 10. The queues were shocking, 2 hours upwards (and the local kids are back at school).   20 to park the car on top of the entry fee   seriously Disney is that anyway to treat the people that pay your wages? Two of the big rides were broken. No shade whilst queueing. And the queues for some rides spilled out onto the main concourses and blocked the way. This was poor management. Talking of which I saw lots of young kids running the queues and serving, but no management at all. As a result the queues were poorly managed and created a few angry exchanges, I noticed. They simply let in too many people for the size of park. It   s greed. And couldn   t be bothered to have the key rides working in the height of the summer. We would have been out and done by 1pm but we had to queue so long. Please save your money and don   t give it to these money grabbers. Or go to Florida where they know how to organise a park. ",1
I honestly don   t know what Disneyland is. It   s not really a theme park since there are hardly any rides. The rides are equivalent to a county fair. It   s just one big souvenir shop with a few county fair rides thrown in. No one is happy here. Kids don   t like it. Adults don   t like it. There is nothing to do but buy souvenirs. Seriously. Six Flags had more exciting things to. Standing in traffic is more exciting than Disneyland. Don   t fall into the trap like us. Disney is not fun. It   s old fashioned. It   s crowded. You wait in line for over an hour even with max pass for a boring 2 min ride. Then you walk another 10 miles to wait another 45 mins to ride another lame ride. The only people who say this place is fun are the type of people who enjoy paying hundreds of dollars for admission to buy coffee mugs and t shirts that have Mickey Mouse or other Disney characters on them. Also i didn   t even see Mickey mouse or any popular. characters. And if you happen to see a character they only stay by the idiots Disney hires to take pictures to sell back to you. Such a scam.,1
"As an annual passholder, you would expect to be treated at a higher level than their guests. You also expect your family to be treated at least equally but better being that you frequent the park and spend on many of their amenities. Sadly, being an annual passholder has negatives that I never expected.When we arrived at the gate, the guy scanning the tickets said there is something wrong with our pass and he had to wait to get the manager. They let me wife go in and daughter but made me wait outside the gate which felt like an eternity. I was embarrassed to watch as many people just constantly go in which the  manager  had to do their rounds. It diddon't help that the guy doing the scanning felt that other customers had higher priority even though I was ahead of them so he had the manager take their requests first.Finally, the manager said, yes, there is a problem with the annual pass. She required my driver license and then left again as I waited some more time. Finally coming back and saying that I can go in. It's unfortunate that I would be mistreated this way. It could have been easily resolved by putting me inside the gate which letting the manager do their processing. Instead, I have to wait outside the gate while constant adults, kids, and babies get let in while I am embarrassingly just sitting outside the gate. A kid even started touching my phone because I was waiting and he saw something interesting on my phone.I have written and even called customer service at Disney Land about my complaints. They responded after I called multiple times and said that they would remedy the situation. I have never heard back from them since. I feel they only would do something if they knew it was a liability concern where they would get in trouble. To the normal frequent customer that just leaves comments, they dodon't care about. They could really do a better job of customer service, especially for annual passholders.",1
"It makes me very sad to say Disneyland is a horrible place to visit now, we just went last week. 6 yrs ago we took my daughter in the summer and it was wonderful. We have been to Disneyworld in Florida several times and it   s crowdwd but still special and employees have a good attitude and it   s efficient. Disneyland is a nightmare now. We went on a Wednesday and what they don   t tell you is that they block the weekends now for annual pass holders so everyone goes during the week. Awful. Way too crowded. Wait in line for EVERYTHING including water and bathrooms. Waits go up to 100 minutes. They let way too many people in. Everyone there seems like they are going through the motions. Paid extra for the max pass and got to use it once b c rides kept shutting down. Monorail was down at night, are you kidding? Can barely walk through the crowds. Walt would be rolling in his grave if he saw the state of the park. Whoever is running this place has gotten very greedy and just lets the whole world in. App is very user unfriendly. Go to Universal Studios Hollywood instead. Much more efficient and employees care. Very sad. Not one person told us to have a magical day which is standard. We have a better experience at the Disney stores in the Midwest. Its not the happiest place on earth but the crappiest.",1
"Not fun anymore when it is super crowded, hour plus lines, poor little kids crying (hot, tired, hungry, standing around waiting for hours for rides) I feel sorry for both parents and little ones. Thousands of strollers and electric scooters, difficult to get around because of the intense crowds. Also not sure how safe it is with that kind of crowding;. Lines for rides 1  hours! ",1
"The place is a dump compared to some other places I've been to. Entering Disneyland I felt like they were leading a bunch of sheep to the slaughter house, the whole front entrance smelled like a toilet for homeless people.The entrance to the park is very lame. There are dull colours everywhere you look,it honestly looks like they havent been updated in years. Dodon't know where people get the 'happiest place on earth' vibe from. Should be renamed 'The Greediest'. Prices for the simplest things are outrageous. Half of the staff spent the day daydreaming, although I can understand why,being paid peanuts you give peanuts. Frontier land and adventure land smell like a middle of stale swamp,where water hasnt flown in years. Actually there are couple of places around the park that smelled like and outdoor toilet, the little water they had was filled with trash. There was also no shaded areas for people while waiting in huuuuuge lines,in the strong heat (probably to dehidrate them so they can spend money on cold drinks ). The tap water is some of the worst and most disgusting I have ever drank. Apparently having couple billion dollars profit a year is not enough to provide filtered cold water taps for people around the park (but they can shoot out fireworks every night). Never in my life have I felt so ripped off and dissapointed as much as I've been at DISNEYLAND. MaxPass (MaxTrash) should be called using this service i felt like i was waiting in LA traffic for it to start working . i cant beleive they charge people to beta test this crap , most rides felt dull and cheap using dark everywhere the could ao they wouldnt need to invest into some real rides , Go check out universal stuidos rides you will see the difference PS: good thing was space mountain amd Fantasmic show ",1
"Today I was severely mistreated while entering Disneyland. With an e cigarette that security threatened to confiscate and not let me return into the park. Forcing me to surrender legal Juul pods and device you can buy at 7 11. The first cast member asked me if it's medically necessary. As a registered nurse, I said automatically said yes. She proceeded to tell me they will confiscate my device so I walked away.Came back and the second cast member asked what'd I do with it. I said I threw it out. He then SCREAMED at me, pointing at me, following me, threatening for me to get it out of the garbage. OUT OF THE GARBAGE!! I ran away telling him to back off.Went back and the sheriff proceeded to me and said I had to surrender my LEGAL Juul e cigarette and they will throw it away. They will not return it. He threatened me saying I will not be allowed to return into the park. Took the device and pods. I explained it was just nicotine, sold at 7 11, showed the website, and that they let people with cigarettes and lighters in the park. He took a picture of my driver's license and park ticket. He eventually gave me back the device and later realized the pods were legally just nicotine. Gave those back too.I'm very very disappointed in the mistreatment, multiple threats and harassment at Disney security. As if this was a vape with CBD oil. It's not. There are smoking areas in the park for crying out loud. This is my 4th day out of 5 days. If it weredon't for my 4 year old son in a stroller, I'd never come back to this place again. A waste of an hour of my time.",1
"We were on our way home with our nine year old granddaughter. We had spent the past two weeks exploring the National parks in Utah and Arizona. Since Disneyland was a few hundred miles away, we decided to take our granddaughter to Disneyland since she had never been there. Took about an hour to get through the parking garage line. Got to the gate and it cost $344 for two adults and one child. Regular pass. If you wanted a fast pass to go ahead of other paying customers it cost more.A seventy minute wait was not uncommon for most of the rides. The rides were also malfunctioning while people were waiting. They would be down for an hour or more. They have a boutique for little girls. Parents can buy Disney dresses and have the child   s hair done. The princess dresses were $350. No we did not purchase one.When the light show started if you were not inside the roped off space you were told to keep walking. I   m sorry but every person in the Park was a paying customer. They were essentially guiding you to the exits, even though the Park was not closed. We will not be returning. I doubt the experience was what Walt Disney had envisioned when he built the Park. Two thumbs down.",1
Everyone always talk about how amazing it would be to go to Disneyland. I wish I didn   t waste my money. $280 to line up for an hour for each ride? It would probably be better with kids to take them on rides but as an adult I wouldn   t bother. ,1
This was the most horrible time to go to Disneyland. The fast passes are only available every two hours. Make sure you dodon't mix up your ticket and leave the park as they wodon't let you back in with the wrong pic attached to the ticket (they tack your picture when you go through entrance). At 9am the wait time for Cars ride was 80 minutes. We picked the fast pass for this ride at 9 and the first opening was 11 and we coulddon't book another fast pass ride until after 11. So disappointing! We were there one day and barely got on 5 rides. ,1
The line ups were crazy. From security to the ticket booths to get in. Rides were impossible to get on. With over a hour wait,1
"Everything is over, outrageous pricing after Disneyland profited $9 Billion in 12 months very pathetic and controlled by greed. Walt Disney created Disneyland for families with family entertainment not for outrageous profit. Most families cadon't afford Disneyland especially the Disneyland hotel, expensive dining, Passport admission, popcorn, snacks to say nothing of the pricing on gifts to bring home.A simple Disneyland weekend $5,000 for 2 nights in the Grand Disneyland Hotel, meals, and 2 days at the theme park. 100% absurd, and ridiculous.Over at Knotts a one year annual pass cost $145 that's 9 times less then a annual Disneyland pass.Disneyland employees are earning less the $12 an hour (POVERITY LEVEL) it's high time for a raise to $17 an hour it's called a livable wage.Affordable family entertainment has lost it's magic at  Disneyland  .Giving Disneyland a generous (1) Star  Shame on Disneyland   greedy corporate misers  ",1
"I really wanted to love Disneyland, but our family's experience was well below average and not what I expected from Disney. We went to Disney World several years ago and had the  magical  Disney experience, so I was really looking forward to this visit. Unfortunately, most of the cast members we had interactions with were rude or unhelpful. We had a terrible experience with  Chris  at Space Mountain. We showed up at 9:30 a.m. during our scheduled FastPass time, only to be told that the system was down and to  come back any time . We went on our way and enjoyed a few other rides, while also continuing to use our FastPass to schedule other rides. We came back just before noon, but my unused FastPass reservation for Space Mountain disappeared from the app by no fault of my own. I explained to Chris what had happened, and asked if we could get on since we were told to come back any time. He was rude, said there is nothing he can do, and told me to make another reservation. I explained again that I already had a reservation, but it got deleted from the app. He continued to argue with me, and even claimed that I had already ridden the ride and was just trying to cut in line. I finally gave up, and angrily stormed off. We went and had a ridiculously overpriced lunch, and then I went back to try again. Thankfully Chris was gone, so I went up to another cast member and again explained my situation. She started to give me the same  there's nothing I can do  speech I heard from Chris, but seeing that I wasdon't going to give up, she got another person to help me. He took my phone and looked it up in their system and again told me I had used the passes. I told him we have never ridden this ride in our lives (it was actually closed for maintenance when we went to Disney World). He begrudgingly took my phone again and added passes back on our account. While we finally got to ride it, I should never have had to argue so much with a Disney employee. They are there to make sure everyone is happy and has a great time, but apparently the cast members I dealt with diddon't get that memo. And this was not the only situation. The cast members are not supposed to say  I dodon't know  or  I cadon't help you,  but I heard that from several that I talked to when I had questions or needed help. Needless to say, this is our one and only trip to Disneyland as I will never go back. We also went to Universal Studios and the San Diego Zoo while we were in California and coulddon't have had a better experience with their employees (at less than half the price of Disneyland, I might add). What was supposed to be the highlight of our trip turned out to be the worst experience we had our entire trip to L.A. and San Diego. Sorry Disney, but you just lost a former lifelong fan.",1
"In the past, I have always loved going to disneyland and enjoying their theme parks. My family and I have loved going to the california adventure and the classic disneyland parks since they were young. The last time that I had visited the park was back in 2005. My kids might have gone since then but I did not because I got busy with life. We went again as a family in May of 2018. It was memorial day weekend but I was willing to work through the crowds and the heat because my kids had really difficult schedules and that was the only week we could go as a family. The park was crowded, especially the mega popular rides like Splash Mountain. I got the fast pass for Splash Mountain and we had to return back there at around 2:30pm. It was around 11am so we decided to try to find some lunch. We tried downtown Disney but all those places were crowded so we drove out of the park and went to a nearby restaurant. We struggled to get back in time. But we were around 30 mins late for the fast pass time zone. So, we struggled to walk all the from the parking lot to the ride. Then, Jennifer would not let us into the ride in the fast pass lane because we were late. I tried to talk to her telling her that we were running late from lunch and struggled to get to the ride through the crowds. But she did not care. She wasdon't going to let us in. I got mad so I told her that I wanted to talk to her supervisor. I stood in front of her until her supervisor came. Then Mat (only one T in Mat) from Encino Hills came to us. He was the supervisor. We talked. He said that it is a  policy  that patrons who are late within 15 mins are allowed in the fast pass. I asked where is that policy written. He said that it is unwritten policy. Then I asked if it isdon't written then why cant our 30 min tardiness be considered okay since it is not a written policy but an spoken policy. He was stubborn as well and did not let us in either. He told me that I can go to City Hall and complain. I got more mad    he wants me to spend more of my precious time to struggle to get to their customer service office and talk to yet another person there, all in the hot afternoon in a crowded disneyland park. Let me tell you something Mat and Jennifer    You made disneyland a very  UNHAPPINESS PLACE IN THE WORLD  for us.You guys need to remember who is paying for all of Disney funds. All the money coming to the theme parks is from people like us. We were not trying to cheat the system. We did not fabricate tickets to get in. We tried to work with the system. We were a small group    a family of five. Disney needs to re learn from Walt Disney that the visitors and patrons should be treated well and with some flexibility when the park is very crowded and hot.Disney   please learn.",1
"Wait times were 2 3 hours on a  moderately  crowded Monday and fast passes were 6 hours out. Multiple rides broke down while we were in line. We rode just 4 rides in 7 hours and finally left out of frustration. I cant imagine what the day would have been like if we had kids or a stroller with us. Not a safe experience with so many people. Clearly the park cant accommodate the crowds and needs to reassess the experience of their GUESTS. Cast members were rude and angry without exception. If you have been to any Orlando parks or Universal, you will be shocked at the state of Disneyland. The lack of signage was almost comical. I am a massive Disney fan and love the other parks. Save your money and time!!",1
"I was expecting it will be the happiest place on earth LOL. Went to the park at 8 am and there you go the line up to the entrance was crazy. You have to line up for the security thing. They will check your stuffs    MANUALLY   . They dont have a scanner or XRAY machine. It took forever. And wasnt sure if they will detect something by just checking those stuffs manually. Then you will pass another security. They took my go pro stick and i was so sad. I literally cried goodthing i have sunglasses on me. They said its their new policy. Whatever ! Then when we were on our way to the park , it was already crowded and i havent seen a crowd like that ever. LOL. It is very a huge park. It was so hot as well. Their prices inside the park for food and everything are so ridiculous. You have to line up for everything. For washroom, rides, foods. Everything! Well, i just wanna try how it feels to be in there. Took a lot of pictures. They have some photographers in some area and they will take picture of you behind those castles and spots then if you have a maxpass you can download the pictures online. So better get a maxpass. We tried some rides. My boyfriend loves them. Then ended up getting sick after some few rides. So we have to go back to our hotel earlier. We were planning to wait for the fireworks. It was fine with me then since it wasnt really my thing. I really hate the crowd. And hate walking that much under the heat of the sun.",1
"So where do i start after visiting Disney World in Orlando last June we were so looking forward to seeing the original Disneyland so disappointed litter seem to be everywhere when you asked a staff member a question for directions ect it seemed a effort for them to tell you, so when you hear about Disney being magical from the moment you go through the gates i think Disney's California park should take a leaf out of Disney World in Orlando for customer service plus teaching them how to smile something we noticed all the staff did in Orlando so i could go on more and think Disney need to take some folks from there Orlando park to retrain the ones in California.",1
"I came here with my family whilst they were on vacation. I knew it was going to be busy, however, it's not good value for money. You spend most of the day queuing and waiting for one or two rides that last 5 minutes. The cost of the ticket is not worth it. They hype up the experience and mostly sell you rubbish. A lot of people expect a dreamy, exciting, fairytale. It's just not the case. DOdon't GO.",1
I am very disappointed in Disneyland and the response that was given to us in regards to an ADA issue that transpired between a cast member  Paul    at It's a small world  and us. He took it upon himself to decide that my kids was not handicapped and removed our red tag indicating special needs and then hid my kids stroller. The attached photo was the generic canned apology that Disney provided without even mentioning what the issue was and this was only provided when prompted and pushed for. Shame on you Disney!!!! Especially to a family that holds 7 unrestricted annual passes! ,1
"We went on a Monday. There are a lot of people, even tough it   s not June yet. The wait on most rides was about 30 minutes. We did get 2 fast pass. Everything is expensive! You will need to come with a lot of money, or big credit card! A bag of cotton candy is $4.75, if you get pink. It is $5.25 otherwise. A turkey leg is over $12. The merchandise is expensive also! A sweet shirt is $50 to $65, depending on if it has a zipper or not. The magnets are about $10. The rides are fun, and you do have somewhat of a good time; however, you won   t want to go back! The park in Orlando is much bigger. They had fireworks here at 9:30, but it only lasted about 7 minutes. It lasted about 30 minuets in Orlando. They were taking your bench away, so they could make reserved seating for special guests that paid them more money! This was to view the fireworks. This is a horrible thing to do! They should have moved these benches before the park opened, rather than pull them out from under us! It would be better yet if they did not reserve seats for groups paying extra! They did this for the parade also. Shame on Disney for doing this! We have a 2 day ticket, so I guess we have to go back. I have not heard much good about the California Park, too many rides broke down. This will be our last time to Disneyland, as Disney World is much better, except for the lack of benches in Florida. We can   t recommend Disneyland!",1
"In LA for a few days and thought what could be better than a visit to Disneyland? As it turned out, ANYTHING. We went on a Thursday and we coulddon't believe the crowds. This wasdon't helped when there were so many strollers in the park. I guess Disney must have shares in a stroller manufacturer. The queues everywhere were horrific. We were in the queue for splash mountain and it broke down. We did get on it later and it broke down while we were on the ride. We went back later and it was broken again. The Pinocchio ride broke down so we coulddon't go in. The Alien boasters broke down as we queues. Surprised we diddon't have a breakdown. We've been to Orlando a few times and it was great. We diddon't think the French would pull it off in Paris, but they did. This is the worst park we've been to. If you cadon't get to any of the other parks then visit here. But you have been warned. Waste of money.",1
"If you enjoy the TSA screening process at airports, you'll love your visit. In fact, some items the TSA has no problems with wodon't pass Disney tests. Case in point. A rolled up 3 legged stool about 10 inches long (see pictures). Refused entry. Strollers the size of small cars   no problem. Seurity woulddon't allow storage in a locker, leaving the item outside the screening area, or even outside the front gate clear out by the street. Required me to personally remove the item from Disney property even after I told them to throw it away. Most Disney employees seem to go out of their way to make the guest experience great, but some of the security staff are unbelievably obnoxious and rude.",1
So! It said 5mins!!!! 20mins have past and still no tram!! Hold on it's coming..again wasting my time in the line                                    ,1
"9:30 in the morning we got sent to overflow parking... Bad sign. Two mile walk to park through downtown Disney no tram... 40 minutes still not in park wait 30 minutes in line to get in and all ride have 45 minutes wait times, too many people to even walk down the street just way to crowded for a Thursday in late April. I cant even imagine what it is like when it is full? We will not be coming Back just not worth the cost and the crowds.",1
If you have teenagers   forget it!! They won   t be interested in this hugely outdated over rated theme park. The so called fast pass is a joke   we arrived at 10 and couldn   t get on our ride of choice until 4. This wasn   t a peak period. Lines are too long for rides that are very underwhelming and haven   t changed in 20 years.. do yourself a favour   take them to six flags   your kids will love you more... if you want nostalgia rewatch a movie and save yourself the pain. ,1
"We, three adults and four kids aged 6 10, visited the Disneyland park March 29th. After a long day in lines and only finishing five rides even with the max pass app we left tired and disappointed. There is very few things that remind the kids of being in Disneyland at all. Luckily we got to see the Beauty and the Beast in the Fantasyland. The rides are outdated and the lines horrible and anything but using the fast pass system unbearable. Be prepared to navigate between thousands of strollers with kids way past toddlers. Are American kids so lazy the cannot walk any longer?Dodon't do it even if it's on your California adventure bucket list. It's not worth it, money or time wise. Spend your money somewhere else. ",1
"This review pertains to the World of Color dessert party at California Adventure, but everything seems to be grouped under DIsneyland here. This event was terrible. Now, yes, part of it was the circumstances. It had been raining a heavy pour all day and we were expecting the show to be cancelled. It was not. Instead we got to sit in wet chairs at soaking wet tables that a cast member could not even be be bothered to wipe a towel across. We were given a plastic lunchbox filled with  desserts,  half of which were stale cheeses and bread sticks. We were offered several alcoholic drinks and chose a vodka concoction which tasted like Juicy Juice mixed with Sprite. So we asked for the sparkling wine next, and it was alright. But when we asked for a second glass, we were told guests were limited to two drinks. Two drinks? For the price I had paid ($80 a head) each of should have received an entire bottle of wine. The show itself was no better than the Bellagio Fountains and since we were freezing, wet, and tired, we left early. Just walked out, later writing a letter to Disneyland about our experience, and actually receiving all of our money back. Clearly, they must have understood something was not right with the way they were going. I would not recommend this event for anyone. Plenty of room was available in the general admission area. Avoid!",1
"This is our 3rd Disney Park and my god was we disappointed. I can honestly see how in 2016 they made 2.4 billion in profits from there parks. They sell happiness but do they sell it at a reasonable price. God no 1 single banana $2.99plus tax, small bottle of water $3.29 plus tax. Walling round this park looking a the 1 to 2 hour plus lines i thought to myself why am I here. Is it for the top rides in the world... No is it for the amazing treatment from there cast... No I actually coulddon't give myself a good enough reason. There food is mediocre for a high price. There rides are not the best in the industry. There is no real value in a Disney park..... Save some money and take the kids to parks that's Invest because they want you to be happy and enjoy not just because they want to rinse you for supply the so called happiest place on earth. ",1
"Ok firstly I say this I love Disneyland and this trip was with my 13 year old daughter on a 10 day hopper pass. We stayed 7 straight and even did a tour and got into Walt   s firehouse apartment HOWEVER here I talk about the new fast pass system MAXPASS. Firstly, it will cost you $10 per person in your party per day. This includes the old photopass. Both of which are must does at the parks. However and sadly,everyone has this   face in your phone thing going on. I don   t know how many people I bumped into as we were both on our phone getting our parties next fastpass. A tip : buy a external charger. With all the use of your phone you   ll run out of batteryeasy ! Moreover, the wifi in the park is hit and miss so how a good amount of data going in. Best of luck ! I noted the fastpass lines weren   t so fast anymore with everyone using it ... ",1
"Knowing how amazing Disney can be, we booked our tickets a while back to take two young teenaged girls. This trip was super disappointing for various reasons, and before you go, you should know... Space Mountain ride was down for most of the day, Matterhorn ride was down after an hour of waiting in line, no fireworks due to construction on site, no parade due to construction on site, extremely overcrowded (as per usual), Haunted House ride stopped for 30 minutes while we were riding, Indiana Jones ride closed when we had our fastpasses, and in general, no theme characters in site no matter where we looked, and walked away from young kids waiting for autographs. After complaining to a park member services staff, we did get two fastpass rides added to our tickets (he was lovely and apologetic). In general the staff are very unfriendly also. Castle is half the size of Orlando's Disneyworld. As per usual, the souvenirs, hoodies, food is all over priced. As Canadians, we spent well over $1200 for a day that definitely missed the Disney mark.",1
"Our family travels to Disney parks 2 3 times a year if not more and as a family of 5 this is not an affordable trip however we love Disney so much the expense is worth it! We usually go to Disney World however decided to take a quick trip to Disneyland this year. We purchased 3 day one park tickets for our family. We went to Disneyland park 2 days and California Adventure for one day. Before leaving we find out many rides were shut down as well as part of Main Street, which we had no choice at this point as flights were booked and time had been taken from work. The first day, February 21, we went to Disneyland park we tried to find the days that we could use our magic morning and the employees in the ticket booth were helpful in finding the days but in no way made the experience magical. Usually at park opening the train comes around with characters on it and a family to open the park and on this day the train arrived with no characters and they did a park opening with a family on the ground in front of park gates that no one could see and it wasn   t very enthusiastic. The process of getting into the park was tedious scan your ticket, take a photo (so your ticket cannot be used by anyone else) and sign your ticket, the gate employees are rather rude and just want to get you in and gone. Walking into the park our kids were excited so we headed toward the rides. The ride lines were longer than usual which may be because so many rides were closed at once. There was a strange incident while we were in line for the gadget coaster in Toontown. The ride was stopped and an announcement was made as if the ride had a maintenance issue. But come to find out there was a man that had a selfie stick and was trying to use it on the ride. We waited about 15 minutes until security got there to remove him and proceed to argue with him at the ride exit. We asked about fireworks and were told by an employee that fireworks were only on the weekends and depended on weather. We purchased some items at the store outside of Space Mountain and the employees were helpful and answered questions and helped us find the sizes we were looking for. There were no parades due to construction on Main Street and no fireworks on this day so we ended up leaving the park earlier than we normally would. Day 2 at Disneyland was what really made this trip awful! On day 2 my brother and his family joined us. My niece is autistic and gets sever anxiety when standing in long unending lines so my sister in law called ahead to make sure she would be able to get an ADA pass for the lines and she was told she could. We waited in line at Town Hall for what seemed like an hour. They finally got in and requested the pass and my sister in law was made to feel like she was lying. They asked a million questions about her disability etc. If it   s the case that someone needs to prove an actual disability, why wasn   t she told over the phone to bring some type of proof with her? However we saw many able bodied people cruising up the exit line with their wheelchairs, were the given the same treatment. Your employees really need some training about autism and how if effects each person differently. We proceeded to the rides after the 20 questions and tried to have a good day. This pass my niece was given was an awful waste of time. She had to go to a specific stand (2 in the entire park) to get one fast pass which many times it seemed the fast pass lines were longer than the regular lines. But hey if we would have spent an $90 a day we could have pre booked our fast passes(a service that is Free at Disneyworld). We ate lunch in Cafe Orleans and it was great. The waitstaff was quick to clear our plates and have friendly conversation with us. Wish all the Disneyland employees were so great! We rode a few more rides and part of our group left for a nap. Later that evening we headed to the queue for Fantasmic, we were pointed to the viewing area for people we did not get fast passes and at the entrance of this queue we asked were stroller parking was and we were told to take it with us. We were walking in dim lighting mind you and looking for a spot with a grumpy tired 3 year old jumping out of his stroller. We were distracted I will say but how many parents at Disneyland go thru the same thing every single day. While we were walking not focused on the ground which I guess we were expected to be, Shania stepped in front of my stroller and said rudely this area is for fast pass only do you have a fastpass? We told her no that someone pointed us down here for queueing of people who did not have fast passes. She told us see this line (a line of green tape on the ground that is not really noticeable) you need to stay on that side. So we found seats and sat down. Unfortunately we were near to ride Shania and another employee who talked the whole time we were waiting. We heard all about her snap chat, listened to her sing about being mixed (I   m also mixed along with my kids so this is in no way related to that), listened to her playing and joking all the while being rude to everyone that didn   t see her line. Then she felt the need to approach us again after sitting in the same spot for 20 minutes to tell us we needed to move our stroller to the back. We loved the stroller and finally the show started. The show was great and we left. The experience we had during this Disneyland trip was so awful we don   t want to return ever. I guess our family got used to the great service at Disneyworld we   re employees are nice and friendly at all times, we never see them on their phones and when they are standing around queuing people they don   t talk about irrelevant things they try to keep that Disney experience away from the outside world. The unfortunate thing is despite all the negative reviews Disneyland is getting is that nothing will change and it will continue to nosedive because the hundred of families that are having awful experiences won   t change ticket sales so they won   t change anything and will continue to raise prices and families will pay to get to experience the theory of Disneyland. I wrote this review in hopes that if people keep pointing out the awful experiences they are having then maybe these kids you are hiring will get some customer service skills instead of continuing to think that they can treat people however they choose because even if that family or person doesn   t return others will. Get it together Disneyland for the millions of other families that are going to waste their money, time and family vacation time on coming there!",1
"Booked a trip to Disney for a week for my 4 year old daughters b day. We have 3 other children. Bought 3 day hopper online only to spend an hour at the ticket booth since staff could not find the tickets in    the system    conformation email apparently was not sufficient. Upon standing in line dealing with a cantankerous female booth worker we were told sorry can   t find them..... So, a not so quick phone call for refund followed and we paid a premium at the booth for same tickets. Finally got in mid day whooo hooo. Met with crowds long waits, over priced food and more unfriendly staff. Mind you this was the off season too. Ordered some food screwed it up, oh well ate it anyway. Several rides closed and Arielle   s Grotto closed. Daughter wanted a meal with the princesses as far as I could research there are no other establishments that offer this. Disney without princesses nice. Furthermore, parking. We made mistake of parking in the shopping area, downtown Disney. For a mere 48$ a day you can park here. We found out later after asking multiple people that you can validate it by spending money in the shopping district. Of course after we   d paid 48$ twice for two days. Booth employee said bring receipt, so ate a 130$ meal for six, brought receipt only to be told nope stamp on ticket only. Asked for a supervisor to plead our case. Brian, the apparent supervisor came told us what you can   t read the sign it   s been there all day since 7:30. The one that says validate you see, wow. Hmmm we are morons perhaps but explained what we   d been told, he said you can   t read? Wow ultimately paid 96$ in one day to park since we left for naps and came back. Ticket from earlier didn   t matter either. It   s down right criminal. Happiest place on earth Nope just look at all the other over paying suckers and ask yourself is it? Problem is putting a price on a child   s happiness a parents weakness of which Disney is the authority of exploitation. This was not our first trip been to Aulani and Disneyworld as well the service here in Anaheim fell far far short it   s become an unfriendly corporate corrupt world with disgruntled unfriendly employees.",1
"I grew up going to Disneyland   was there on opening day of Space Mountain in the 1970s. It used to be so fun at Disneyland   not too crowded, clean park, everything running & polite staff. As an adult and parent   I have taken my daughter to Disneyland 3 times now   each time it got progressively less magical with the cost, the dirtiness factor, the LONG & RIDICULOUS lines and main attractions closed. This is really not the  happiest place on earth . My daughter rather go to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk! ",1
"We (a family of 10, ages 2 68) all visited Disneyland & California Adventure Park on February 16 & 17. It was a waste of time & money. Adventure Park: maybe 4 rides for people over the age of 7 and the waits for those rides were rediculous (1.5   2 hours). Many of the rides were closed or broke down during our visit. Next day at Disneyland, again rides closed, long waits, rides breaking down left and right and way too many people! We should have been told more about the parks when we purchased the tickets or even when I called in advance to ask questions. One park is primarily for little kids and the other, unless you pay for the Fastpass app and figure out how to use it quickly, dodon't waste your time or money going here. I personally cannot ride any rides due to medical issues, but still had to pay full price (rent for the space I took up while standing for hours waiting, possibly??)",1
go somewhere where there were some guards who came to me that they thought it was me who did something criminal or something and I did not even get the money back! 1300kr away on nothing,1
"Most expensive place on earth! Paid over $4000 for 3 nights at Disneyland Grand Californian, 2 day Park passes for 3 people (two adults one toddler). Bought the max pass in addition and ate every meal on premises. Extraordinarily expensive and low value. There were 5 rides broken throughout the Saturday Feb 10 (Snow white, Pinocchio, Star Wars, Roger Rabbit, Small World) that we know of. This causes the lines at working rides to double triple in length. Received Bonus multi fast pass on app because one of the rides was broken. Nice! But Wanted to use it at Small World and told we couldn   t because the fast pass machine was broken!! At every turn, even when Disney tried to make it right, it failed. Also, Disney won   t tell you the ENTIRE railway system on main street and castle area is 100% under construction across the park so the crowds have no where to go. There is no mention of this at time Of booking with the Disney travel agent by the way    and they charge you the same. January is typically construction time but it   s now mid Feb. Unacceptable. The staff were average at best as even said to us    we are breaking down   . Ate character breakfast at Park with Mini, made reservations, etc sat us in corner, no one cleared our plates until we were 100% done, and food was greasy and low quality. Disney will gladly take your money, treat you average and not tell you they should discount their prices because they sell something that is subpar. Their Tomorrowland is 1970   s Star Wars. The submarine ride is 1970   s 20,000 leagues under the sea now with Nemo holograms. Old. But if they were to improve something, they should invest more money in their app. We still had paper plastic tickets and none of our stay was linked to the app automatically. It should all be automated! Systems are not talking to each other and it shows. Not seamless. They are running an average operation at best and over selling it based on their reputation. Disney corporate should take note of the poor reviews on Trip Advisor. I don   t even see any comments fromDisney management on Trip Advisor explaining the situation. So, sorry, but the Disney magic is gone for me in California. My recommendation is to look for another park or another vacation location to spend your hard earned dollars. Disneyland lost its luster and its simply not worth the money anymore. The park is aging and it needs a major redo to keep up with the times. Walt would be disappointed. Maybe try Florida. ",1
"This park is alright, but the only thing it has that Disney World doesdon't have is the Matterhorn. Otherwise, it's too small and generally boring compared to Disney World in Orlando.",1
I have visited Disney for 20 years. great times . great memories. Over the last 5 years the park has become more crowded or less staffed. The rides are not kept up like they used to be or they are used harder . Disney used to be pristine. from rides to hedges to sparking restrooms. This is not the case any longer. It seems that good enough is the new standard. Having major attractions closed for renovations is part of the maintenance. Having 3 of your 6 major rides down seems like i am being ripped off. The food is 3 out of 10. the price is 400% out side in the real world. if you are going to charge me. that rate have the decency to make it taste like someone actually tried it before you tried to sell it. Bottom line is   you will go because you are forced by tradition   you will miss the good old days when there was pride taken in doing an exceptional job and a desire to provide you a magical day. my advice pack a lunch and a few snacks. Follow up a year later. Same issues only worse. Bathroom cleaning was just horrible. Gross as can be. The grounds were dirty and unkept. Buzz light year ride smelled so bad i was embarrassed I had my kids there. Food is still un worthy of any cost . Got stuck on space mountain snd thunder mountain. Go to universal Studios  they seem to be on the rise ,1
"New Year's Eve was horrible. By noon there was standing room only. There was long lines to eat, to shop, to use the restrooms, several hours for all rides. They should limit the amount of people or double the price of admission and try and limit crowds on special days. So people can enjoy a special day at a special place. Nothing feels special when you cadon't take a step anywhere without almost stepping on someone.On the day I went, things were so congested and miserable that some people were walking around with very poor attitudes. I witnessed 2 different insidents where fights almost erupted. Not a nice atmosphere for the kids.I'll be hard pressed to return.",1
"Sad to say, this is the last time I   ll ever visit Disney. It   s an over crowded, worn out park that has nothing to offer than 2.5 hour wait times with smelly Americans who fart because of the amount of junk food they consume. Nothing worked as it should, and all our photos from the small amount of rides we actually got to go on we   re in accessible due to the payment system failing. Don   t waste your time and money to line up.",1
Paid $125 for one ticket was told that they have something called fast pass but every time I went to use the fast pass they said that it was all filled up cat use.each ride was at least a two hour waitI was really looking forward to was the fireworks waited from 8:00 until 930 got a good spot was told THEN. they said we're sorry we're not doing it due to wind yet nothing was windy the trees weredon't blowing we all were saying they must've just run out of fireworks In 10 hours only got on five rides because the rest of the time we were just waiting in line to go on a rides Walt Disney had a documentary and he said he wanted the park to be affordable for everybody I cadon't even imagine a family of four paying so much money and getting so disappointed it's the biggest rip off on or not the happiest place on earth,1
"We have been annual pass holders for several years but now, we will not renew. Disney has been changing their policies and apparently improving services    for the worse. Now they have the Max Fast Pass. They charge $10 per person. We bought it, never worked. Wasted all of our time trying to get a refund and didn   t get any fast pass. Information told us ticketing will be able to refund us, but ticketing said the only ones who could refund was the app and to call there. DO not waste your time getting this app service because you   ll end up wasting all your time trying to get your money back for something that doesn   t work. ",1
We spent $600 on tickets and were only able to go on 6 rides over a two day visit. Wait times were 120 to 150 minutes. No ride is worth that wait. It's a pretty park but coulddon't even enjoy the views because of all the people.,1
My family and friends went to LA Disney today and to say we were disappointed is an understatement. Don   t waste your money. They say they allow 60000 to 70000 people before they shut the park. Try 200000. Could not move. Only half the Park was open due to power problems. We were there from 8am till late afternoon and only managed 2 rides. The lines were 2 to 3 hours wait on some rides. The rest were and hour. Didn   t see any characters and the lines for food were ridiculous. We traveled from Australia and this was our must do in LA. Forget it. Waste of time. Hated it. 1 Star is too many,1
"We frequent Disneyland every few years all the way from NZ. This trip was made due to the changes due next year and the closing changing of a few things in the area so we thought we go this year rather than next. We keep up to date by a number of bloggers and online 'Disney' fanatics and were looking forward to seeing the Christmas thanks giving celebrations and decor. While the decorations didn   t disappoint the customer service and staff did. Normally the park turns over like a well oiled machine, knowing where to line up, being advised to stay one side, the staff advising of ride closures and reopens but over the 10 days we were at the parks there were so many ride lines that extended past the normal waiting areas and no staff around to let people know where to continue to form the line so people were pushing and jumping into the Q. The worst is where a families have one person line up and then when they are close to the front the whole family joins the Q. When we were waiting for both Santa and Jack & Sally there were more than 40 people that joined the Q towards the end on each occasion and we counted more than 50 for Soaring. While I understand that this is a 'guest issue' It would be nice if they would address this and maybe just a friendly reminder that you must have everyone in your party that wishes to ride in line etc.At the Matterhorn there was an older guy who looked like he was trying to be way more important that he was, switching lines all over the place telling people to move from the back of the line to the front. Not taking the single riders but instead splitting families and leaving the single riders line getting bigger and bigger. The other girl kept looking up to the control window as guest continued to question why the lines were being mixed up so badly but again none of the staff did anything. We rode the next day and they were still doing the same thing.A few times when we were served it was mid conversation with other cast members and some almost didn   t even look up. We received better customer service at Target that we did at Disneyland. If you are from overseas I wouldn   t follow the Disney style vlogs and blogs too much. Wi Fi is almost nonexistence so don   t read into the hype of the max & photo pass. The snack food they say is so delicious.. 8 10 times its actually not. When they say walk don   t run (you   ll be the only ones actually walking) yes it IS Disneyland and there are a CRAZY number of giant prams and strollers but that seems to be catered for however the number of ride on scooters    SERIOUSLY THERE ARE HUNDREDS and the drivers don   t budge it   s like they have a feeling of entitlement, we saw adults on these things constantly cutting off EVERYONE, including children and people in wheelchairs. We were asked a number of times to fill out a questionnaire but all of the questions were always 'where are you from' 'what hotel did you stay in' 'who did you travel with' yet we were asked to do the same thing at Universal and were taken upstairs and asked questions that were regarding improving our experience at the park, what we enjoyed and disliked and the interaction of staff and characters with us during our time at the park. Disney was just interested in volume and numbers. So many things on the internet are made out to be better than they actually are and unfortunately this was our experience with Disneyland over 10 days this time around. The park itself is beautiful and we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. We will no doubt continue to visit but next time Instead of making it the 'destination of the our trips' our expectations will be lower and our pass with be no more than 3 days.Really disappointed",1
"I've written many reviews and so few are bad ones.The Disney Magic is an old man behind a curtain. The rides are ancient and break down all the time. You get to wait in line for over an hour ( yes the fast pass works some times ) and then the rides dodon't always work. We had 3 of 7 rides break down before and while we were on them. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME for $1,000 day. Let's add it up, Park tickets, food, hotel and transportation....yep $1,000. We wrote them about the rides breaking down but they really diddon't care. Spend your money elsewhere and you've not feel as we did.",1
Decided to take my little one because I think every kid deserves to go at least once but this place is a joke and so over priced. I spent 600 dollars on tickets for me and my babe which I shoulddon't have spent that much it's a damn rip off. The stupid fast pass I used once and it woulddon't let me use it anymore which was another waste of money. Plus they stop fast passes around 5pm so you have to do times like right when you get to the park. It's so crowded like you cadon't move without getting bumped or hit. I was there for 16 hours and rode 7 rides with my baby because most of the wait was a hour and a half to three hours which is nuts it shoulddon't be that way. It isdon't how it used to be that's for sure. ,1
"Went to Disneyland on Monday, Nov 20 with my husband. We decided to purchase the    MaxPass    to get the most out of our visit. You   re supposed to be able to book fast pass lines in advance on your phone, however you can only book one ride at a time.So we arrived at Disneyland at 8:30 AM, our first fast pass ride wasn   t available until 11:20 (splash mountain). Did this, then booked the next available fast pass at 12:50. The park became so packed and busy with people, we could barely walk anywhere! We tried going for lunch but all restaurants kept telling visitors that it was    reservation only    and we would be turned away. We stood in line for 45 minutes for a hot dog, then barely made it to Indiana Jones where we stood in the    fast line    for 30 minutes. After this ride, we tried to book another but the next available ride wasn   t until 2:50 pm. There was a parade going on and we couldn   t get across the park to space mountain, etc (all other ride wait times were 75 minutes   as per the park!!)We just decided to leave, not worth the money or wait, and the park was way too packed with people.Such a waste of money.",1
"I know Disneyland is called the  Happiest Place on Earth , but I was highly disappointed on my recent visit.. my 4 year old grand daughter and her mom, my other daughter and myself all planned a surprise first visit to Disney for my grand daughter...We bought a day pass as my daughter and grand daughter flew down from Washington state for only a few days.We were anticipating a fantastic day, and we did enjoy it, as my 4 year old was excited and loved the rides, with  Splash Mountain  as a favorite. we had arrived early to make the most of the day, 10 am to 10pm...Then around 8:30 pm we decided to ride  Peter Pan  , the most popular kids attraction in Fantasyland,which earlier in the day the line was too long, even at 8:30 pm we still had to wait patiently for 30 min!We get too the front of the line after a long wait, and were told to all 4 of us get into the ride, we tried to sit comfortably , but it just wasdon't going to work, my granddaughter was trying to adjust and stood up with her back to the heavy metal bar that is pushed down to secure you in the ride, then the girl handling the ride told us to please sit down and proceeded to push the bar down on my grand daughters back several times. I was appalled and told her we woulddon't all fit, the handler  Gracie  kept insisting, I asked her if we could step out and hop in next car? she insisted we stuff inside.She was extremely rude to all of us and to push a metal bar down on my grand daughters back was not necessary... Gracie then said something rude to my 2 daughters , rolled her eyes and after we got out she sent them on into the ride, told my grand daughter and I to step back behind the yellow line and then slammed her hand down on the control panel and stopped the entire ride, and stormed off....I really coulddon't believe what I was seeing. then another young woman came to handle the controls and I asked her the name of the girl who stormed off, she said she diddon't know and that she was new to Disney and the ride itself. A few moments later a young man came in and several other employees and they proceeded to talk about how to get the ride running again. This young man it turns out was  Javier  the manager of the ride.We were baffled as to why the ride wasdon't proceeding,My daughters called me from inside the ride and said the lights came on inside the ride with another couple in front of them wondering what happened, at least 20 minutes later the ride started again, never an apology to us having to wait, then my 2 daughters inside had to ride with all lights on and got to end of the ride and asked if they could ride again but were told to get off.Gracie, the rude girl was now at the end of the ride and threw up her hand , rolled her eyes and said something rude to my daughters again. the manger Javier was told what had happened and how we were all harassed , and said it wasdon't harassement, and he brushed it off.At this time we were told to get back on the ride, my grand daughter and myself and ride through, I was disgusted by the treatment and lack there of, and never offered any explanation.Luckily after meeting my 2 daughters at end of ride, and exiting we found another Peter Pan worker , Gabby , who told us to go to the City Hall, and ask for a  Plaid  to file a complaint. she was the only ride employee who offered an apology for what had just happened...and said that not all the employees at Disney are so nice....We were extremely upset and decided to go take the train to the City Hall at the entrance as we were all exhausted, we finally arrived and had to wait in a long line to file a complaint.This was now 10:pm at night and we were so tired, we waited in the customer complaint line for over 30 min. and go inside and the young woman heard our plea, and was so scripted in her answer, saying how sorry she was this all happened and that this was not a good experience and then she offered us  fast passes' the rides , and no other compensation, We were in shock, as it was 10:30 pm at night, and the park closed in 30 min... and they were offering us fast passes... I have taken this up via email and phone call to Disneyland customer support with no offering except saying the employees would be under review and that was it...they coulddon't offer any further compensation.I would think that Disney could at the mimimum offer us a return park tickets to experience another day to redeem the bad experience or offer us our money back, at the least, as the harassement we received was highly unnecessary and a 4 year old should never have a metal bar pushed down on her back.... this was her first ever Disneyland experience and one she will remember...Anyone else have a similar experience? please let me know .",1
Visited the park on Veterans day. Massive queue of traffic just to get to the parking ticket booth. Fortunately I had already bought the park entry tickets as the line to buy was also long. The park must have been at capacity as there was really only space to stand for each person. Even with fast passes and arriving early in the morning we managed to get only a small number of rides. 145 minute wait to ride on  its a small world  was unbelievable. I do not recommend wasting your valuable time and effort coming to this park. If you wish to see Disney go to magic kingdom on the east coast. For me this was not a good experience which was quite surprising.,1
"took my kids here many many times could not wait to bring grandson and I qm here to tell you this is not Disneyland, it is a theme park that has its hand out. They need to start limiting the amount of people it is soi uncomfortable, they should tell people thsat since they are coming in the week they will be shorted three hours each day, will not see paraded and will not see fireworks but they WILL PAY the same price!!! They are not happy, they are rude especially on the monorail where being in a wheel chair I was mortified thank you for that we aredon't uncomfortable enough. the food offered had Dropped by about 90 points it is bad so bring your own you will be in a giant grease pit if you dodon't and you will pay dearly for It too when a hot dog is 9 dollars! the nicest cast members were at the haunted house kudos to all of them!! I was sadden by something my parents took me to in 55, and many years after, then I took my kids all their childhood and they went as teenagers and my first trip with grandson and I was disgusted and embarrassed it is not walts park any more.",1
"We were in town for a couple days and bought a couple single day park hopper passes at about 10PM from our hotel on Oct 21 for use on Oct 22. We were sold on the idea to add MaxPass to the tickets to help with Fastpass lines. I ordered Maxpass using the App 1030PM Oct 21 for both our passes. When we got to the park, the app said we had to buy the max passes again. Tried to buy again and still diddon't work. I phoned in and was on hold for 9 min at 9:49am and again at 10:56 for another 9 min and called again and finally got through. I was told they coulddon't refund the charges on the phone and that I had to visit park guest services. This is totally unreasonable. I spent 45 min lining up and visiting guest services to explain. They were suggesting that it may be a problem with my phone or the signal. 5 other people were complaining at the same time. It seemed to be the only complaint that day. Why not just admit it's not working, sincerely apologize and offer an immediate and prompt refund. They finally refunded me after much wasted time and unnecessary discussions. The next day, Oct 23, my credit card was charged again for another $20.00 but I had deleted the app so I cadon't figure out how or why we were charged again? I call in today Oct 24 to complain (another 15 min on the phone, transfer to a supervisor, etc) and was told I should get a refund back in a couple weeks latest but to keep checking. A good business would extend an offer at a minimum of an instant refund (not one that takes hours of complaining and time on hold to receive). Since it took hours to conclude, Id also extend an offer a courtesy comp pass for the next visit to make up for the inconvenience. No such customer service experience with Disneyland. Walt Disney's legacy was the creation of what most humans think of as the happiest place on earth. He left that legacy in the hands of management to maintain and uphold. My opinion is that responsibility is sacred and that Disney Corp needs to consider this when making policy and procedures. Sometimes you need to let your staff be human and deal with issues as they see fit but I get the feeling staff have their hands tied or are poorly trained about customer service. I understand that certain policy is in place to prevent abuse of your system but it can be a double edge sword when a policy is too cumbersome, rigid and firm, you will end up hurting your good customers and turning your staff into subservient robots insincerely spouting canned speech language about how disingenuously sorry they are for your trouble.

"We recently visited Disneyland on Saturday, October 7, 2017, and had a rather unfortunate experience. My husband and I were able to enjoy most of the park on a busy day (due to much strategic planning and use of the fastpass system). That was great as it was his first time, but it'll probably be our last time.A huge damper was put on our visit when we went to ride Splash Mountain. I was so excited to ride as we used one of our fastpasses and bypassed a 90 min lineup. I was worried when we were put in a boat with four other men (my husband and I are by no means tiny) but I figured we would be fine if a cast member thought it was okay for that much weight in the boat. The ride was great, we had a monumental tidal wave that thoroughly soaked us   all in good fun!What was NOT fun at all was when we got to the unloading zone the boat was too heavy to make it back up the mechanism   we were stuck just beyond the emergency exit. After about 15 mins the cast members unloaded all of the other boats but told us to stay where we were. Due to liability, the jump to make it back to the emergency exit was too big. We needed to stay where we were in order to not be escorted out of the park. The fire dept had been called and would be coming soon.More than 60 minutes later the firemen showed up, only to tell us  Sorry it took so long but someone called us and told us you diddon't need us anymore . That was NOT something that you want to hear after waiting for so long to be 'rescued'.In the 60 minutes that we waited our boat was a spectacle for all the people in line. We were pointed and laughed at, photos and videos were taken. Some of the men in the boat were visibly very uncomfortable with the additional attention and requested numerous times that the lineup to be cleared from sight to stop the ridicule. Nothing was done   Cast members themselves all came to check out the situation   not to be confused with 'Check on'.At no point was there communication to us or regular updates   there was no 'are you okay' from cast members, or can we get you anything. One request made by another one of the men was just a simple plastic bag as his phone and camera had been soaked and ruined from the splash   he had to ask four times.The issue isdon't that we were stuck or that we had to wait. I get it, rides break, stuff happens and it's all a part of the experience. The thing that's so upsetting is that this is DISNEY. The epitome of customer service and the place where the magic happens, NOT a place to be pointed and laughed at, underserviced, or shrugged off.I followed up with Disney customer service and received a cookie cutter canned response  we're sorry the ride broke  and  we're sorry you had bad service  cut and paste out of an employee manual.I completely understand that things happen, rides and attractions have technical difficulties. Our experience was a little beyond 'disappointment over the temporary closure of Splash Mountain', it was the fact that we WERE the temporary closure of Splash Mountain as a result of poor judgment of the staff. As such we were treated distastefully by all staff, not to mention the harassment and spectacle we endured during the wait.We had already missed the fireworks.Visiting from Canada for the weekend we only had one day in the park. I asked if we could talk to someone about the possibility of a meal voucher or gift card for the shops we were shrugged off and they told us to go to 'city hall' customer service, where I could wait again and lose the rest of our ONLY evening. We had at this point already lost almost 2 hours of our very limited time in the park.It would be nice to receive a genuine apology for myself and the other men in the boat. This is Disney... the epitome of customer service and the go to example used in all experiential marketing. I'm hoping they can make it right and restore the magic in my eyes.I would also strongly encourage a weight distribution disclaimer for your staff at Splash Mountain   rather than cramming the boats full, consideration of safety first.Disneyland is NOT what it used to be.",1
Too crowded we were there 4 days and could not get a photo with Mickey or Minnie! everytime we went to line up Mickey or Minnie had to go for a rest this happened for 4 days! I said to a lady its one little girl we have been here 4 days and going home today this is our last chance!! nope they dodon't care Badluck see ya later attitude!! Not the happiest friendliest staff on earth !!!!!!!,1
"We are an Indian family, I had visited with my wife and 2 small children, and had visited the classic disneyland park, though the park facilities were superb, the staff at the park were racial in their attitude, specially calling out one irritating experience which ruined our whole trip to the park, during evenings their is this lazer light show near the lake, one of the white male staff who was in his 50's wearing the short's and tucked in shirt with a hat, the usual staff attire at the park, was rudely behaving with my family and was insisting that we cannot stand at a spot, though my wife was pleading to let us stand for a few minutes as we were getting our children ready to move, here we have this monster threatening my family when i could see there were other White couples and their families and other white individuals whom he was ignoring, and specifically targeting us, i really regret taking my family to this racist park with staff behaving rudely around small children like wild dogs. Shame.",1
Disney has to do something about the lines the wait times have gotten out of control.  It isdon't any fun when you cadon't even walk down near New Orleans Square.  It's so crowded.,1
Long lines which I expected but not good with young children ( 6 years old) We were told that by buying advance tickets we could skip the long lines to get in. It took 1 hour in the bag search line then another hour in the ticket line. Kids were having meltdowns everywhere. Parents were frustrated. We took autograph books to get character autographs and pictures but lines to get up to see the characters were at least 60 100 people long. Two days there... got two autographs and went on two rides.So awful we just went back to hotel to swim. Fireworks were nice. We watched them from the hotel.,1
"It makes no sense to spend the better part of $200 to walk thru the gate and stand in line all dang day to get on just 3 4 rides!!! The cost of food is ridiculous!!!! They do try to maintain park cleanliness but it's difficult. It is just a total money grab by the Disney Corp. They claimed they raised prices to cut down on crowds but they know DARN WELL people will still go, and they will take their kids and grand kids. The only way to limit crowds is to LIMIT CROWDS. Find a maximum number and then close the gates!!! They threaten to do that all the time but I've never seen it actually done. So bring a picnic lunch, bring ur walkin (standin) shoes and go enjoy the Happiest (most crowded) Place On Earth!!!! And dodon't forget ur camera to get the pics of the little ones (after standing in a ridiculous line of course!)",1
"Disneyland was short staffed. Security only had 2 lines open. Maintenance coulddon't keep up on broken rides. Half of Fantasyland wasdon't open for magic morning. Hours were 10am 8pm even though the whole park was packed to the point that parking lots were closed. Until Disneyland can get a clue that THERE IS NO OFF SEASON, then I will stop attending. I dodon't need to pay that much for my family to be thrown whatever scraps disney decides to throw me in September...even though I am paying the same full price as July folks.",1
We went in a weekday early in the morning. It was supposed to be an off peak day. Terribly long queues. The wait time is way more than the announced one (in the couple of plays we tried). The park is small so loads of visitors jammed on the available plays. We left after 3 hours. We cant wait 1 hour in line. I cadon't imagine how weekends look like !I guess people only tolerate this for their kids. So if you are a group of friends couple with no kids avoid by all means. ,1
"Too crowded even a weekday , way too long lines, 3 different lines just to get in the park ( security, train, entrance)   Music too loud  This was my first and last time at Disney  Definitively not for me .",1
"Shoulder to shoulder, hot with minimal shade, lines too long to actually go on anything.After several dismissive interactions with staff the whole horrible weekend culminated in me sitting on a bench and crying, while passersby (and  cast members ) pretended not to see me.I've never felt less valued as a customer. I wish we'd saved the money. I would never go back.",1
"This is not the first amusement park we visit, so we know we should prepare to wait in line, but 30 60 minutes?! Are you serious! It started with waiting in line to pay for parking, yes you need to pay for parking as well. Then you wait in line to board a tram. Then to buy a ticket. Then you think ok, I've just spent 1 hour in lines and paid $400 it will be amazing. Well it isdon't and quite an opposite ! For some reason adults are going on the children rides by themselves! I would never recommend this Park to anyone. ",1
"It is very bad experience and the waiting time is to much foe each game, and the fast pass is vey bad idea ,at least they have to make an option for the game as fast lane in universal studios , veryyyyyyyy baaaaaaaaaaaaaad experience and my advice if you wang to come, come only to walk and see , really you do not need to wait one hour for five minute game .",1
The worst place with kids to visit they were over priced in about 4 hours we were done it's too small for the price they charge not enough the one in ORLANDO it's 100 times better,1
"Numerous problems with Disneyland Park in California.Pros:1. Fireworks show is good....thats the only positiveCons: 1. Parks are dangerously overcrowded2. 40 min que just to get into customer relations due to a problem with one of our tickets3. Lack of adequate signs for the main exit, fast past distribution signs lacking and why put fast past distribution away from the ride entrance area?...lots of people asking where ride fast pass booths were....if people have to ask then maybe put better signs up!. Some rides have fastpass lines split into 2 without any signs......heres an idea..put some signs up!4. No fans...in 96 degrees ques. Florida gas lots of fans on for the ques so why none at disneyland?...lack of shade in que lines.5. Numerous ride breakdowns. Toy story mania broke down and it was like it was all the staffs 1st day, they were useless and the tannoy was by an inaudible member of staff.6. No please or thank you by staff serving at the food carts....manners cost nothing.7. 2 days at the parks and no sign of mickey or minnie mouse!!....really poor.8. Price of souvenirs and parking higher than florida.9. Lines to get into the park, through bag check and onto trams way too long.10. Three large construction cranes in plain view in disneyland....you will need to edit them out of any pictures.11. Castle is tiny compared to florida12. Distinct lack of shows compared to florida13. Happiest place on earth?. Really.....many many miserable staff, fed up customers.First and most definetly last ever disney trip.",1
"Dodon't think of trying to come here if you dodon't have an experienced Disney local to help you find your way to get tickets and enter the park. We were shocked with the lack of information online beforehand, and the absence of people to help us find our way to the entrance and to explain how the park works. There are no helpful signs at the park entrance. When you ask people standing around chatting to each other in uniforms they get annoyed that you've interrupted their chats and tell you to go to the ticket booth. Where is the ticket booth???There are so many varieties of tickets available and strange systems of fast past etc. No information is available from Disney about how this all works. We had to spend hours beforehand reading reviews and blogs from Disney enthusiasts. Once we finally made it inside, paying a very tidy sum to do so, the place is jam packed with shops, shops and more shops! There are a few rides, but you'll spend hours and hours queuing for them. We really got the sense that Disneyland took our enthusiasm and efforts to come to Anaheim for granted. They diddon't need to lift a finger to do anything to make it a happy place, as long as we were spending money ",1
"I was screamed at by one of the staff . Like what the hell , i am a customer dodon't i get any respect. All because she thought i was stealing which it was clearly not cause i got the freakin receipt",1
"I've been to Disneyland 10 or 12 times since I was a kid 55 years ago. It's really changed a lot in the last 10 years and not for the better. The parking lot is a rat's maze. My niece was on crutches and it was a loooong hike to the front gate. We rented an electric wheelchair for $50. A push chair was $30. We went down to the end of Main street to where there used to be an inside restaurant on the East side. It's a breakfast buffet now. They asked if I had reservations. Ha. They seated us outside in the 95 degree sun. The food was mediocre at best. The cost for a family of 4 was $140.  Holy crap!  I blurted out. I apologized for saying a bad word to the lady running the cash register. Most of the Disney characters came to the table to say hello. But I had to chase down Minnie to get a picture. We went to the Indiana Jones ride and waited for an hour to get on it. Then we went to the Haunted house. Another hour in line in the 95 degree sun. We coulddon't get our family of four into 2 cars because she cadon't walk very good and the cars were moving way too fast for her to negotiate. She fell into a car and my wife jumped into it with her. We got split up into 3 cars. I got in a car with 2 strangers that was meant to hold 2 people. Stopped by a vendor to get 2 pops and 2 waters. That's a quick $16. Damn! You have a choice of dehydrating or getting robbed buying drinks. I've never seen so many people crammed into such a small area as Disneyland on a Saturday. It was the same routine all day. Wait for an hour or an hour and a half in line for a 3 minute ride. Then get ripped off paying $4 for a 10 cent bottle of water or $4 for an ice cream bar. We drove 1,300 miles for that. I should have just gone to Compton to get robbed by someone who really needed the money. There isdon't hardly anywhere to sit and rest. Near the end of an exhausting day was the parade. No place to sit. But you can stand way in the back (if you're lucky) for the parade. Then at night comes the parade of lights. What a mess getting crammed into a mass of humanity. The girl working crowd control said we should come back for the later parade at 10:45. She said  You only have to come 5 minutes early to get a good seat.  That's the biggest lie I've heard in a long time. Then there was the fireworks. Standing on Main street sandwiched in the mass of sweaty people wasdon't a lot of fun. It was jam packed with tens of thousands of people pushing up against you. I wanted out of there to get some fresh air but coulddon't move an inch. Disneyland was fun in the old days. The more they try to improve it the worse it gets. There is NO WAY I'll ever go there again. I'll just go to the bathroom and flush $3000 down the toilet instead.",1
"It has been a horrible day, we arrived early to avoid all the waiting and we found out that you have to purchase a fast track at machines that sometimes due to all people you cannot see, plus you still have to wait and line up... so basically a full rubbish and tiring day because we only got to go on a few rides oh and between we had to go to another side to apply for farst track then to another. This we eventuslly worked out as we never got it explained properly and then the lunch was another story to dine in a nice romantic dark with lights in new orleans area to feel ripped off. So expensive tickets and meal and diddon't get much out of it. And I love the final  icing to the cake moment . I walk into a shop asking if there was anywhere in the park who would sell a beast toy teddy for my niece since she loved beauty and the beast movie and has the 2 bellas' and is missing the beast and I had promissed her to get her one... well I was looked like I was weird and tokd they dodon't sell those toys, only when the movie came out and that was a long time ago and that they move on to new movies (excuse me??? Old movie??? I mean the film you dumb and that is a classic!!!! Go and do some serious studying) anyway... I found they DO sell somethings of beauty and the beast but unfortunately not the doll teddy of beast. So overall, a very dissapointed day. Wsnted to go to the park since I was a kid and realised I had such a better time at Universal Studios. At least their system works, got to go on the rides and enjoy the park without all the stress to of waiting to go on the ride... that was the reason we paid more. Sorry disney, but I bet I am not the only one who has felt ripped off and had their day ruined.",1
We have been to Disneyland many times and never had a problem until this trip. I have Rheumatoid arthritis and while I may look  normal  it is very difficult to stand for any period of time. I guess they have a new policy where you have to convince the person that you have a disability. I guess she felt that I wasdon't disabled enough as she said that if I was unwilling to have my husband push me around in a wheelchair I was going to have a difficult time. Well she was right I had a difficult time and ended up leaving hours early. Good thing my children are old enough to stay themselves otherwise the whole family would have been disappointed. We will be spending our money on other vacations as this will be our last trip to Disneyland.,1
"I hate everything about this place, which sucks cause growing up I loved it. My last experience will most definitely keep me from ever coming back.",1
"This was the first visit to Disneyland for myself, my husband and two of our grandsons. We were so disappointed by how dirty the park was especially the bathrooms. Diddon't find a clean one the whole 4 days there. The prices at the nicer restaurants are outrageous averaging $250 per dinner for the four of us. 90% of the staff i.e. Cast Members were unfriendly and some down right rude. Fast passes for the more popular rides were sold out by 10:00 AM every day. We were told we would get early admission one day with a multiple day pass but when we tried to use it we were told it is only good on specific days of the week. It was our last day, a Thursday and not valid on that day so we were turned away. We found the same scenario at California Adventure. We would never return to this place and woulddon't recommend it either. We go frequently to Disney World and will be going again in August this year. We have NEVER EVER been disappointed there. ",1
"The actual experience is so far short of what we expected and frankly was a horrible let down. I feel like we were cheated and mistreated. The buildup is telling the kids how great it will be, spending huge money buying park tickets and hotel rooms, as well as the travel expense to get there and time off work for a dream vacation you've been talking about for years. The reality is long line after long line as you sweat in the hot sun all the while getting angry at the reality of it all. We went on a Thursday and the park was packed, as I realize it must be every day. We were able to ride 4 or 5 rides the entire day. Lines were over 2 hours long for anything you'd get excited about. It was hot. They have no misters to cool you down and do not provide enough shade in the lines. They have a fast pass system that was either broken for some rides, or sold out within a couple hours of the park opening due to too many distributed already, so we were out of luck for any remedies to the long waits. We spent thousands of dollars on this vacation and got to ride 4 or 5 rides that were about 60 seconds long after hours and hours of waiting, what a deal. The experience was just so disappointing. Wow how far Disneyland has fallen. Happiest place on earth? Really? I would have rather sat in traffic for 8 hours, which is basically what we did, only without the comfort of seats, air conditioning, and a radio.",1
"I recently visited your Disneyland Theme Park and I had the absolutely worse and unpleasant experience as I was entering the shuttle area to go into the Disney theme park. Meek yelled at my family and embarrasses us in front of many guests and other staff. And on top of that, she refused to answer our questions about getting to the park! This was outrageous and very poor customer service.My family and I were dropped off in the  Woody  Shuttle area and we were yelled at by a staff member   MEEK (Chicago, IL). She was extremely rude and had poor customer service towards us. I understand that we were confused by which Shuttle area to wait at as there are many stops to choose from, Buzz Lightyear, Woody, ect., however as we were crossing the street to go to the Woody area   she immediately yelled  NO! GO BACK AROUND THE SIDEWALK! . We stopped on the sidewalk and asked  But we are looking for the shuttle to go to the park.  She continues to yell  NO! WALK AROUND THE SIDEWALK! . I responded,  I just have a question about     and she cuts me off by again yelling,  I DOdon't CARE, IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION WALK AROUND THE SIDEWALK TO ME! . This was extremely embarrassing for my family by being made a spectacle in front of all of the many guests and staff that were in the area. I coulddon't believe my first moment at Disney was so unpleasant. I would have appreciated if she was more civil with her approach and added  Please  or  For your safety, please come towards this side.  But her rude tone and aggression towards my family was uncalled for. To make matters worse, my family walked over to the Woody Shuttle area and when we got there, she REFUSED to answer our question! My family heard her say  I dodon't want to answer their question. Have someone else talk to them.  That's outrageous that a Disney staff member woulddon't even be willing to help us. First, this staff member(MEEK) yells at and embarrasses my family   and then, she refuses to answer our question. This start of the day completely ruined our Disney trip and we coulddon't enjoy the rest of the day. Just because of one poor experience in the beginning. My family flew out all the way from Florida for this one day and it was ruined by one poor staff member. I hope the training could get better for the the shuttle parking staff and that Meek gets the proper repercussion. The parking staff are the very first people to see Disney guests and I would hope that the very first moment at Disney starts as magical and that they understand the importance of a first impression.",1
"Today I'm in Disneyland in Anaheim, CA. I'm here to report that two of their most popular attractions are closed due to maintenance issues. The Hunted Manssion and the Thunder Mountain. It is a shame that a park like this is having this kind of issues when summer is kicking of. I cadon't do anything but wonder when we will hear about a safety incident here. Also feel like I'm owed a refund because no one told us about this until we showed up at entrance. The fact that these attractions were closed caused that the others to be extremely crowded making the park experience completely worthless. ",1
After all the hype you hear about Disney it was a sham and a waste of a vacation day. Literally rammed prams left right and centre (babies cadon't go on the rides) queues for days. I'm struggling to see what adults actually enjoyed it. Would never visit a Disney est again. No rides just attractions. . ,1
"Disney customer service used to be second to none. That has changed and it's disappointing.The park is overcrowded and cast members seem to despise their jobs. You never used to hear them chit chatting among themselves but I was privy to a conversation between two workers in Toon town discussing how understaffed they were, and how one requested full time but diddon't get it, and blah blah. The ride CMs seem especially annoyed by the guests, but I guess with so many guests and not enough employees...in fact our Star Tours ride was delayed because one guest was left without a seat.Walt would be very very sad to see what's become of Disneyland...the magic is gone and I wodon't pay thousands of dollars when I can get the same level of service for less at Knotts OR even better service for less at Universal! Yes, Universal now surpasses Disneyland for customer service (California Adventure is still superior though!)",1
"Went here on 05 20 17. Never have I seen such utter disregard for the handicapped, or such poor customer service. We got there just after opening. The group was my cousin and her husband and myself, wife and daughter. My cousin purchased the tickets some $700 plus worth. First thing my cousin did being from Minnesota was buy a few souvenirs. About an hour in we decided to go to the Haunted Mansion. My cousins husband has major back difficulties, so my cousin had me stay with her husband and she and my wife went to ask how we could make it easier on her husband. They came back to us and my cousin was hot. She stated that the girl at the gate told her that even the crips must wait in the line. We went back to the gate to confront the girl but she was gone. My cousins husband decided to try and tuff out the line. A one point my cousin spotted the employee that was rude to her. The employee saw her coming and removed her name badge. They argued. She exited somewhere into the ride and disappeared. I tried to calm down my cousin, She was HOT!! Finally I thought things were going better. We were in Fantasyland were my cousin decided to get a Coke. She went to the stand where they sell Coke products, She asked if the had Coke Zero, to which the person operating the stand named Anthony said if you want Coke Zero you better find a liquor store. I gave the young man a hard time but my cousin lost it. We went to the front gates where she complained. She then took her passes, souvenirs and anything else she had that was Disney and tossed them in the trash and we left the park after only a couple of hours. We then ended up over at Knott's Berry Farm where we had a great time. A day later I wrote an email to Disneyland describing my displeasure. I received a phone call and an email while I was at work. I called back and spoke to a lady named Susan. From the get go this lady basically accused me of being a liar. She made statements like our cast members would never do that. Oh my they would never say that. Well news flash Susan the little fools did do and say that. My cousins husband can barely walk and he was treated like a sub zero human. They have fools at the concession stands looking only yo get a paycheck. I know what I'm going to do. I will never set foot on a Disney property ever again. We chucked out all their DVD's. My cousin contacted me about the incident, and never wants to hear about it again. To the folks that have read my reviews in the past. I am giving you fair warning. You can this place the Happiest Place on Earth, I call it the most money hungry unethical place I have ever seen. You pay hundreds of dollars to get in only to be treated like dirt. If you want a real good time try Knott's Berry Farm. This is a place I really enjoy and your treated like a human being not a discarded piece of trash. See ya later Disneyland. You can continue your corporate greed at someone else's expense, NOT MINE!!!!!!!!",1
"On May 20 and 21 we visited Disneyland and Ca Adventure to celebrate my granddaughters 1st birthday. They drove all the way from AZ for this event. The park reached capacity in May 20 and it was a hot day. We hardly got on any rides since the lines were terrible. We had to leave the park early both days due to heat and excessive wait times in lines. It was miserable. I spent almost $1,500 on this weekend alone for my only grandchild. I was so sad they had to leave back to AZ without enjoying this special day for my granddaughter. She diddon't even get a picture with Mickey Mouse. I emailed guest relations a week ago and still have not received a reply.",1
I took my 8 year old niece and 4 year old nephew for the first time to Disneyland and there miserable cuz it was so overcrowded and there was still letting people in we pay over $400 and only stay for two hours since we bought are tickets ahead of time so we coulddon't get a refund back would never come back to this place it's change since I come 4 years ago. They should let people know how crowded it would be,1
It wasdon't worth the money over crowded did get to see many characters the ones my kid got to sign her book was at the character breakfast only diddon't get on but two rides because of the time waiting 1hour in the half each wait it was not fun at all I wish I never paid my money but the character breakfast was outstanding. ,1
"So, we were foolish enough to try this park again, I guess we love the punishment. The staff were RUDE when we asked why all the rides were broken and were offered a free fastpass with way outrageous as we were leaving the park. We were to be contacted by management, never were and I believe that is the real issue here, poor management. Walt Disney would be screaming if he found out how the family runs this park today. 80% of the rides were broken and we were told, this doesdon't happen often and is not acceptable, but then offer nothing after you have paid 100 dollars per person. Funny thing is in 2014 we were here and all the rides were also broken, I doubt we picked lucked out both times,this is an ongoing problem. Now compare this to Disneyworld in Florida and it's night and day, we were there 3 times now and no issues with rides or other problems. This park needs to get it together and get things operating correctly, it costs too much to be constantly disappointed. As for us this is absolutely the last time, Universal Studios was SO much better and nothing was broken. WAKE UP MANAGEMENT !",1
Got our stroller stolen today by Grizzly river run. Headed over to file a report and then with Anaheim PD next. Disneyland security wodon't do anything about the situation. If you Need you can file a claim online with Anahein PD alsp there are officers just outside downtown Disney by the Starbucks. ,1
"Went with entire family for a reunion. Have done this many times in the past and had great experiences. Not so much this trip. What a disappointment. Lines were horrible, starting with 30 minutes to get through security to pick up previously purchased tickets. This took 40 minutes at the window..not kidding, where we were treated like criminals even though we had just dropped a cool $6000  on tickets for the entire extended family. They refused to give us our tickets without us giving them a list of names for each ticket....so they could write our names on them for us, even though when we used them the first time they took our pictures. Took FOREVER! This was a start to a not very happy place. We spent days standing in lines, only to have the rides break down due to  technical difficulties . This became a joke...all week we kept saying anytime something happened, it was 'technical difficulties'...or in the words of my nephew, due to Davy Jones...ie tentacle difficulties. The one day we only managed 2 rides after spending hours standing in lines because the rides kept breaking down  Cars, California Screamin, Grizzly Rapids, etc. Even with fast passes on some rides...would use them and then they refused to give them back when the rides broke down, even though we haddon't ridden yet. And when I questioned the cast member who I had just handed the fast past too, he was extremely rude and condensing. I told him he had ruined the day when he woulddon't give us our fast passes back to use later when the ride opened back up and he told me I was welcome. I have never seen such poor customer service in my dozen trips before. We even got stuck on one ride (monsters inc) that broke down for over 15 minutes. The one night we stayed to watch World of Color? The show stopped after 5 minutes due to technical difficulties. The night we stayed at Disneyland to watch the fireworks? Cancelled due to technical difficulties. Complained and was told it was due to the large crowds at spring break they weredon't used to that was making the rides run so much so they kept stopping...Really? Have seen the park way more crowded with less issues. Maybe it is a sign of a poorly managed run down park with rides that havedon't been properly maintained. When we did manage to use fast passes, some of the rides still took over 30 minutes to get on..not exactly fast. My brothers left and went to Universal one day with their families and said it was 1000 times better. On top of it, everything is way over priced. $10  for a corn dog and a soda worth at most $3? Not much magic anymore. ",1
I just visited Disneyland for 2 days with my 2 kids and it has declined in the past 10 years. Too expensive and too crowded. Disney needs to crowd control and come up with a better plan for fast passes. The restrooms aredon't kept clean and it seems like you are getting less for your money. I let my annual pass go because of rising prices and it just isdon't worth it to go anymore. Maybe Disney World in Orlando is better but Anaheim is going downhill. It's too bad they are all about profit and not treating the guests who spend hard earned money like they are important. ,1
Recently visited Disneyland for 2 days. The crowds were horrific   people everywhere. I used Ridemax and nothing worked   Fastpasses barely helped. At one point the wait time at thePeter Pan ride in Storyland was 100 minutes. Really?! This seems like child abuse   Disney corporation. The crowd size needs to be limited which I know will never happen   corporate greed! This was last trip to Disney for our family so at least 4 less people.,1
"I was in one of the marching bands that performed last week during spring break. When we went behind the scenes, the cast members were very rude to us, and to be honest, treated us like garbage. After we had finished our parade, (Which we technically paid disney for us to do in the form of park tickets) we had to walk from behind space mountain to the back of toon town, all while we were burning up in our thick uniforms in the spring heat. Meanwhile, about four empty trams passed by us going the same direction. The only thing we got from being free entertainment for Disney was a super cheap generic Chinese made 3   cinch bag. Keep in mind that we paid Disney to entertain their guests, which they, in return, gave us some cheap disney branded crap and 4 miles of walking in our uniforms.",1
"Unfortunately, our very first experience at the park was trying to rent a stroller. Once we stood in line for more than 40 minutes to get in, we were sent back OUT of the park to the rental booth. When we went out our hand was stamped and I was directed to the rental station by the attendant. Once the stroller was rented I returned to the same attendant to reenter the park. She asked if I had a 'card'. I said,  No, you diddon't give me one when I was here 10 minutes ago.  She told me I would have to go all the way back through the LONG line to get back into the park!@! I asked how I would know I needed a 'card' when she clearly diddon't give me one. She said that she 'diddon't remember me' and turned her back on me. I was furious and asked for her supervisor. Another employee nearby   not looking at me said,  go to the other line . And that was that. The day was RIDICULOUS. There were so many people in the park we could not even walk; let alone keep our family together. Rides? HA! We rode 3 all day   arrived at 9am and left at 11pm   and that was WITH Fast Passes and a wheelchair. It was one of the most expensive and HORRIBLE days of our lives. No one had fun. What a farce.",1
To experience any ride   minimum wait time was 1 hour.  Even on the fast pass   it told us to come back 3 7 hours later.     Two hours into trip   we left... never to return.   No wonder parents and kids have meltdowns......,1
We visited Disneyland in Anaheim recently and were very disappointed.It was our first visit. We paid more than 1K for us and 3 kids for park visit for 2 days.Waiting for each attraction is 45 minutes average. We had a baby and were asked to leave the stroller each time at the beginning of the line for attraction. And then I had to carry the baby for 45 minutes in waiting for each attraction. Bizarre and crazy experience. Never again! The attractions themself very childish and the whole experience wasdon't worth the money even close. After first day my legs were finished and second day was a complete suffer.Never again we'll go to Disneyland. They even diddon't have the option to buy front in line pass like Universal studios have. The Universal studios definitely worth the money.,1
"The kids had a great time BUT what they missed was the old days of getting to ride on ALMOST every ride. They must of had the park filled to compacity as it was PACKED. Wall to wall people and very hard to move. We got to ride on a total of 3 rides (with 2 of them Fast Track). How can a family nowadays afford to pay $600 (with gas, food, parking, etc) and go on 3 rides and say it was a successful day? That's $35 a ride. Disneyland has forgotten what it was originally built for   familys to have fun and enjoy the day. What a rip......",1
We visited the Happiest Place on Earth on Match 13 and 14 2017. It is widely known by all including Disney that this week was spring break in Arizona and other states that people flock from to go to DL.Tuesday the 14th was extremely crowded and hot. Guess what only 1 monorail running that day. WHY?My wife's back was really hurting her so she was going to take monorail back to downtown Disney to go to our room at the DL hotel and walk.She waited 1 hour before she was able to take the monorail!!Disney is usually known for having their ducks in a row and all their bases covered.Not this time with only 1 monorail operating at this very very busy time is very poor planning.,1
"My first visit experience: This place is super duper crowded and so freaking expensive. I had very high expectations and was very disappointed. We spent 3 days here and every single day was horrible due to how crowded it was. We literally spent like an hour waiting for rides that were each less than 5 minutes long. I cannot understand why the Disney company would allow so many people to enter the park and let it become hell on earth. I cannot believe people put up with such bs from Disney with how pricey those entrance tickets are.I always heard that the park is always clean and bathrooms too. Nope, thats not accurate there was so many people that those bathrooms were pretty filthy.I cannot understand why the food which is of cheap quality would be so expensive. There is not many places where you can sit and rest. Also we tried watching the parade and fireworks but there was nowhere to go and see it. Many people take up all the good viewing spaces for the parade and fireworks a few hours prior to the show. So if you want to see it from a good place make sure you are there at 5pm. On our third and final day we had given up on this family vacation. We left early to our hotel and decided to just rest from all the horrible things that happened at Disney. Never again Disney. First and last time visiting unless they can change and find a solution for the overcrowding issue.",1
Drove from Texas 20 hours in the car with 5 kids to visit what was once one of my favorite places. Arrived at the park to find 3 of the best rides closed with no advance notice. 3 of the rides broke down while we were in line adding a min of 45 minutes to our wait on each ride. Staff is still super friendly but the park is tired and old ..Spent $900 on tickets and it just wasnt worth it.,1
"The lines were ridiculous!!! 2 to 2 1 2 hours! We have loved Disneyland. I brought my daughter's for their 16th and 21st birthdays. For the average family it takes hard work to save the money to be able to go to Disneyland and to arrive and there be massive crowds and at least 14 ride closures plus many times having rides temporarily unavailable or go down after we waited in line for over an hour.... disappointing is an understatement. To also find out that there were some deep California resident discounts given that increased the crowds.... greedy! And to have bathrooms dirty and even the rides be untidy. Oh my goodness, and THEN... we ordered the mac n cheese at the Carnation restaurant and the only mac n cheese in the menu was $9, we were charged $20 each!!!! What on earth???",1
"This place is much too overcrowded and over priced which took all of the fun out of our visit. First, long lines to get through security. Then long lines to purchase very expensive tickets. Then long lines to use our expensive tickets and enter an overcrowded park. Then long lines for every ride and amusement (many exceeding one hour). Then discovering that my favorite rides we closed. No Pirates of the Caribbean, no Matterhorn, no train, no Tom Sawyer's Island, and no Mark Twain paddle wheeler. Then to have two rides break down after waiting in long lines (Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain.) Then to wait in long lines for overpriced and bland food, and discovering that they had run out of forks and napkins. Then to wait in long lines for a rest room. Then to take a really hard look at many of the worn out buildings, and being turned off by old out of date rides (submarine, Autopia, Small World). Then to find expensive snacks ($4.00 for a chocolate chip cookie? Come on!!!). The Magic is Gone from Disneyland. Walt Disney would be embarrassed and ashamed. It's not the park I knew as a kid in the 60s and 70s. Corporate greed at its very worst. Dodon't go here. Dodon't go here. Please do not go here!!!",1
"Many years ago I visited this park and had a great time. No major cues, great normal food and a clean park. Today I returned with my wife. What a change. An extremely expensive entrance fee   110 usd per perspn   and for what? The park was overcrowded from 10.30. Long cues to every attraction (more than one hour   EACH place). Fastpass? Well, you could ask for a fastpass and get a ride many hours later. I tried it twice. First time at 11am   fastpass to 2.45 pm!! Next time at 1.50pm (i was not allowed to as for an earlier pass) this time I got a ride at 11.15 pm!!! Felt so sorry for the many kids ...No decent food was obtainable. The few ordinary restaurants were fully booked the whole day. The rest of  restaurants  were serving junkfood. Filth and garbage was found on the streets everywhere. Greed has overtaken this old gem. Apparently the park lets far too many people in to get a great profit. What a pity   and total loss of a lot of money for the visitors. So sad. Walt Disney must be turning in his grave ...",1
"Too Crowded, too pricey, and has lost it's charm. Disneyland of the 50's 60's 70's and 80's was a wonderful place to visit. It has lost all charm. If you enjoy standing line line at the DMV you will love this place. Everything has a price tag on it and now all the rides exit to their overpriced gift shops. I'll bet Walt is just rolling over in his grave.",1
went to Disneyland  was a total disappointment  very small compared to Disneyworld in florida  should have went to California adventure Disneyland is for small children  no adult interests,1
"I hate the whole thing, the traffic, the line up for parking, the paying for parking, the line up for the tram to the gate, the line up at the gate, the line up for security, the line up to get in the park, the line up for now, either food or ride? Oh, BTW, you have now spent at least $150, done nothing but line up and lost 2 hours of your day",1
"Not a very well run place, staff rude, due to the amount of people, boycott and go straight to Florida, that's a Disney you dreamed of, and great staff and very helpful,",1
"Firstly, to be rejected at your entrance due to an extending go pro stick that I had in my possession was very disappointing!!! We waited in long lines to get bag searched only to be told once we had got to the front that gopro sticks were not allowed!! ABSOLUTELY NO SIGNS TO GIVE PEOPLE ADVANCED NOTICE!!! It does not make for a good day having travelled half way across the world to fulfill a childhood dream.Secondly, your lines are ridiculous!! People pay a good amount of money to come here and are barely able to get on rides due to the lines! Yes you have fast track options, but seriously, the amount of money given for entrance for approximately 6 rides people can get in within a day? Doesdon't add up !! You are making money off people's childhood dreams to attend a famous park yet not really giving them an experience that they deserve for the money they pay, there seriously needs to be discussion around the amount of people that should enter on any given day, this would ensure all round fairness.Pretty disappointed in this park and the lack of attention it gives to ensuring guests times here are a pleasurable experience.",1
"I have been visiting Disneyland for over 45 years and it has always been a place I have loved to visit. We as a family have visited the park in the last 20 years probably 8 times. We try to go every 2   3 years and it has become a family tradition and something we look forward to. Over time it has become less magical and unfortunately I find myself while we are there questioning what we are doing and whether it is worth it. We just went last week and it might be our last. This was the first time we had gone at Christmas time and we knew that it would be super crowded, but I had no concept of how crowded it would and could be. We always expect crowds and are normally good at managing them and accomplishing what we need to in order to have a good experience. These crowds were unmanageable. We literally coulddon't move at times. My favorite area is over by Adventureland and New Orleans Square. There were so many people and the lines for the three major rides over there were so long that they were spilling out into the walkways and made it impossible to move. You literally coulddon't walk normally, you just kind of shuffled your feet as you were pressed by bodies and tried to stay with your family. Many times the mass of people would stop and not be able to move and you would have to find another route. We found ourselves going through restaurants and over chairs to get through and heaven forbid if you needed to change directions and part the red sea. Besides the rides my favorite thing about Disneyland is the atmosphere and soaking in all the wonderful details, buildings, decorations, etc. When you are in a sea of people, getting hit in the shins with strollers and getting run over by motorized scooters, the last thing you are enjoying is the atmosphere. There is nowhere to just sit down and take a break, catch your breath and look around. The areas over by New Orleans Square that you can normally sit and enjoy yourself are filled with the overflowing lines of Pirates and The Haunted Mansion. It is exhausting and it gets to the point that all you want to do is leave, but you dodon't want to because of all the money you spent. You shoulddon't feel physically violated after a day at Disneyland. It has lost the charm for me and isdon't worth it any more. Obviously it is popular and people want to go there, but there needs to be a limit where it doesdon't ruin the experience for the visitors that are there. The rides are cool, but there is a line that you cross when the ride isdon't enjoyable any more because of how long you had to wait. The wait time for the Radiator Springs Racers ride was 240 minutes. Yes the ride is cool, but it is 4 minutes long and no ride is worth waiting 4 hours. You could watch 2 movies. I just dodon't know if it is worth it any more which is sad because I love Disneyland. The return is not worth the cost and hassle. Disney is letting their fans down for the almighty dollar. They need to limit the crowds so that those that are in the park can have an enjoyable time. It gets worse every time I go and it is out of control at this point. It took over an hour each day just to park and get in the park. If we ever go again we will look for a less busy time than Christmas, but from what I read that may not exist. Disney needs to build a new park in Texas or somewhere else or limit their crowds and put their customers' enjoyment first.",1
"I'm a Californian and I wodon't recommend coming to Disneyland to any tourist , save your money since there is a parking fee of 18 US Dlls and also each ticket is 105 US dlls per person . I'm a traveler and I finally decided to come here but you pay a log for only two rides , yes that's ride by the time you go to park your car and the entrance of the theme park you have waisted 2 hrs and 5 lines . This is the most expensive park and I wodon't recommend , there are other sites in California for your kids to visit . You will spend about 1500 dlls with accommodations and tickets just for only one day . There is Santa Monica and other theme parks with less headaches and more organize in California. Disneyland is just overrated for the kind of money you spend in here . Please keep your money and take your kids to see a Disneyland show instead they would enjoy it more . ",1
"Before I get into the meat of my review I would like to say that I was raised on Disneyland CA. No place has ever reached my heart the way this magical place has. With much to my despair I'll have to disclose the following. I have been to all the Disney parks around the world except for the ones in China. Disneyland CA although the original, is slipping dramatically in regards to customer service, crowd control, and overall appearance. I believe a lot has to do with the multitude of crowds being packed into a small acreage of land. But my biggest disappointment on my last visit in Nov. 2016 was definitely with the customer service. It could be that Disneyland CA may have limited options available when hiring adequate personnel but it obviously seems that the employees  cast members  are not happy working at what is supposed to be the happiest place on earth. It breaks my heart to say this. I always put Disneyland at the top when it came to the friendliness of it's  cast members . Unfortunately that is not the case anymore. My last visit I found many of the cast members rude, unpleasant, and overall uncaring about delivering the Disney brand. Now with that being said I'll also have to add that a lot of the guests there were not very pleasant either. This sense of entitlement that everyone seemed to have staggered me.The upkeep of the park was below par. Hopefully the new expansion of the Star Wars land will allow more room for the multitude of people who visit. Or it could possibly make matters worse. I'm crossing my fingers that things will turn around for Disneyland CA. NOTE TO GUESTS: Remember when you go to Disneyland you're there to have fun. Not to act like you own the park. It's OK to be a kid again just dodon't act like a spoiled one. Be courteous to fellow park goers!",1
"Visited Disney with 100000 of my friends. Coulddon't move, only got to go on a few rides, coulddon't see the parade. Even had a restricted view of the fireworks. Would be a great place off peak, but shuffling around the park not being able go move is not that much fun. Especially paying a fortune for it . ",1
"Although we spend almost 10 hours in the park, we were able to ride only 5 or 6 attractions. We went on a Monday, which should has help with the crowd's. This was my first time to disneyland and my fifth visit to a Walt Disney Property and me and my family had decided not to come back to any of them.",1
"Disneyland is great, and I am even willing to pay crazy prices for the experience but over the past couple of years, it has become impossible to find a pleasant day. We visited the first Monday and Tuesday of December this year and it was impossible for our group of 3 to walk together anywhere in the park. Some of the lines aredon't too bad even when they are long because they continually move, but just walking from ride to ride is total frustration. Seriously, there must have been 40,000 strollers in the park. Lines at the food carts, lines for the restrooms, crowd control for the stores, it's miserable. It's hard to even see the charm of the park among the masses. I am just happy we were able to enjoy the park back when it was still manageable. I would definitely not recommend this place until your children are at least old enough to remember and appreciate and get the full experience of the park.",1
"I have lived on the west coast most of my life. I have had many wonderful times with my family over the years and have had the Annual Pass for several years. On my last visit, my fiance and I decided that we will not be coming back to Disneyland unless they make improvements. With a theme park such as this, it is reasonable to expect that it will be expensive and that there will be lines, but what you dodon't expect is to be treated disrespectfully by the staff and nearly be trampled to death just walking throughout the park. The staff each year seems to grow exceedingly condescending. Their lack of crowd control and directing creates a very stressful and sometimes dangerous experience for the visitor. If you have little children, hold on to them very closely because they will very likely be knocked over.",1
"If the Earth were to ever take an enema, the site would be here at this hideously overpriced, broken down artifact from the 1950s. Disneyland Park is the flagship of old Walt's evil plan to take over the world. And it seems to be working, since Disney, Inc. satellite  parks  have sprung up like poison mushrooms all around the globe, even in Paris. Disneyland shamelessly separates rube families from their hard earned cash with shockingly high admission fees, souvenirs made of crap, and junk food at sky high prices. Several of the aging main attractions were broken down when we visited. The implicit message from the parent corporation running this rank obscenity is that you pay through the nose, then get the hell out as soon as possible to make room for more suckers. You wodon't find a drinking fountain, a shady spot, or a place to sit down anywhere, so be prepared to get exhausted by being on your feet all day and for your kids to go bonkers overdosing on sugary drinks. You'll lucky indeed to avoid getting your toes flattened by one of the bloated legions of  Handicapped,  morbidly obese scooter riders you'll see everywhere who get to crowd to the front of the endless lines at the few rides that are working. And you wodon't be able to find a good drink anywhere either. But take solace that you can decompress when you leave what I call my version of hell on Earth with a well earned series of Martinis at Morton's about a mile away.",1
"My family and I travelled 16 hours from Australia to enter the magical enchanted world of Disneyland. Well I can tell you the only land we encounted was pram land!! You cadon't take a selfie stick into the park yet you can take a double decker pram (stroller) that takes up the whole path. They let so many people into the park that you cadon't tell the lines for the rides from the paths that lead around the theme park. Parades were ok... But destroy half the excitement when they close all the attractions for it. Overall we spent a small fortune to go on only two rides in a whole day. Fast path works, but it can be just as long a line to get to the fast path ticket booth as it is for the ride itself. There are two hundred times as many people in the park as there are seats, so dodon't expect to sit down to eat your lunch. So disappointed ",1
"We found some cast members snarky, rude or blatantly uncaring. We encountered swipe issues with our credit card on day two and so spent the trip telling cashiers that it would have to be entered manually as it wasdon't swiping. The cast member in pieces of eight gave me a dirty look and asked me why I was bothering to use it. We are from Canada, we have no option to run to the bank and get a new card issued during a 5 day trip, it's just not feasible. Other cast members actually challenged us and said no it wasdon't and swiped it about 15 times then tried the plastic bag method. My concern came when the card was actually getting bent as this was unfortunately the only card we had brought with us. The cashier at the pin store called for a manager and they came and tried another pos machine. She swipes it a dozen or more times while telling us that of course it would work. Then loudly announces it was declined. I have a minor heart attack at this as I was monitoring our spending and we were no where near our limit. She swipes it and Murphy's law the damn thing works and goes through. No apologies, just see I told you so (literally). I was honestly unimpressed and at that point was so frustrated that I said forget it I'm done took my bag and said that I was not happy and explain I was supposed to be taking a customer service course with Disney next year but was reconsidering based on in park experiences. She congratulated me at getting a job with Disney. I explain I wasdon't working for Disney, I love my job. I was done and the last comment was most likely really rude but at that point I diddon't care. Disney needs to spend more money on cit a hug and re educating their service staff or lose their reputation",1
"Wow i will never be going back and heres why ... 1. This park was a mess with no signage to help you find your way around, or to even get in the park and no one that worked there helped and those who watched us struggle made no attempt to come over to help..2. The park layout was a mess it was every man for him self once you payed for the ticket. when you walked in it was easy to get turned around and with a lack of signs it was easy to walk right by and miss the rides .. 3. The lines for the rides were long and boring .. no entertainment to help the time go by faster.. no fans in the under cover hallways which made it hot and muggy. The employes were pushy and not in character .. 4. Was there for 6 hours and only seen Genie and Alladin and Belle for characters So that was crappy for the kids who were constantly looking for every one to take pictures with them 5. We stopped for lunch and bought 2 salads and 2 bottles of water with a very very small dessert and it costed $50 Every thing cost way to much. Which is an insult after having to spend $100 per person to enter the park and $20 for parking .. 6. After the long boring wait in the line up to go on a ride .. the ride it self left you in shock . For rides built for kids .. the snow white ride started with story of snow white then jumped right in to the nasty queen trying to push here posin apple of you in the dark  scary  like woods and ends with the queen rolling a boulder down a hill at the dwarfes ..... like what the heck where is the happy ending ?? The pirates of the carribion was odd as well with 2 maybe 3 movie show displays And the rest being bunch of pirates pillageing a town shooting up and setting the town on fire there all drunk and it basically ends with tied up women lined up that theyre selling and forcing to become mail order brides ... welp dont know about you but i didnt see THAT movie ...7. The serious lack of bathrooms and bathroom stalls in the bathrooms so once again we were waiting in a line .. Final note ... this wasnt the grand disney land experiance we all long for when we see their addvertising on tv .. not even close .. it was a massive dispointment When we left we had frowns and we werent the only ones about 80% of every one on the train back to parking looked disapointed.",1
"We visited Disneyland during the time period that everyone again states that it's the slowest post of the season and the park should be empty. Well apparently 1 persons definition of empty is the opposite of mine. Out of our 5 day trip, only 1 morning for 2 hours wasdon't absolutley jam packed solid. What amazes me is the sheer volume of people that openly talk about pulling their kids out of school to go to Disneyland for a day. 3 5 days all of toontown was closed except for Micky and Minnie's house. With 1 3rd of the park already closed to build Star Wars, that's simply unacceptable. On several occasions I witnessed children playing with wheelchairs, yet when they went up to rides and adult would sit in it and act injured, when the ride was over they'd get up and walk normally allowing the kids to play in the chair again until the next ride. Disneyland has a horrible policy on disabled persons. To allow that type of abuse is simply ridiculous.AP days are a joke, we got a bottle of water and a tiny pin and got to stand outside in the 95 degree heat, yippee. Last time they had bags of popcorn and it was inside an air conditioned building.With kids back in school the park diddon't open until 10am. seriously, that's way too late to open a park that is supposed to cater to small children.The best pointer I can pass along is that whichever park has magic morning, go to the other park instead. The park with magic morning is already overrun and you'll just be standing in line to stand in line again.",1
"I have been to Disneyland many times over the last 20 years so I know how it used to be. It's sad that over those visits, the experience has gotten progressively worse. Way overcrowded and expensive. Quality of food was poor. And what happened to variety? Our last visit to the Orlando park 2 years ago was disappointing and we said we would never visit Disneyland again. But we did only because we travelled half way around the world with friends who had never been before. It was embarrassing that we recommended the visit thinking it would be still be magical for first timers.We visited on a Tuesday, low season as it were. So many rides were broken down or under maintenance. Fantasmic was under maintenance (there was nothing to replace that) and there were no fireworks. Only on weekends, they said. Stood in line for Big Thunder Mountain for almost an hour and that broke down. Got a Fast Pass at 2pm to return to Space Mountain at 8pm only to have that break down as well. All they said was sorry and no idea when it would be fixed. People were angry and yelling at the staff. I felt sorry for them as it's not their fault but they handled the situation badly. Staff were clearly over worked and not happy. Parents were frustrated. Kids were impatient standing in line for hours. Happiest place on Earth? Definitely not. There used to be Disney cast around every corner but on this visit, we saw only Pluto and that was on our way out at 9pm. It wasdon't Disneyland. It was a Disney themed park, at best. With lots of Disney merchandise to make up for the missing cast if anyone is interested in parting with a lot of money. This is it. Never again Disneyland.",1
"I love amusement parks but hated Disneyland.It looks like the corporate greed at Disney is at its peak. We went during low season in October and it was still crowded and packed with lines averaging between 30 60 minutes per ride.Everything is overly priced, so the overall feeling is not  we want to make your kids happy , but rather  We want your money, and all of it .If you're willing to pay $100 per ticket and wait 45 minutes for a 30 60 second ride, by all means, go ahead   I will never make that mistake again.They are obviously filling the park up to it's legal limit where you feel like you are in a herd so they can maximize their profit.Highlights:  Wait in 15 minutes of traffic to pay for parking.   Pay $18 for parking followed by 15 minutes traffic to enter parking lot.  Walk 10 15 minutes more to the tram that leads to the entrance.  Wait on line for the tram 10 more minutes.  Drive another 5 minutes on a tram to the entrance.   Wait another 5 minutes on line to pass security  After passing security, even with e ticket, wait another 5 10 minutes on line to get into the park.  Once entered, squeeze between the herd of people.  Wait on 40 60 minutes lines during low season.   After leaving the park, spend another 25 30 minutes to get to the car.If Disney were to pay me $100, I would not go there again.If you have small children, you are better off paying $18 and going to Adventure Land, with lines ranging from no wait time at all to about 5 10 minute waits.",1
"Imagine months of planning and excitement all because a family of 3 is going to go to the 'magic kingdom'for the first time together.Now imagine the horror of arriving to find a park with near consistent 45 to 90 minute waits!In a nutshell: I had a 4 day park hopper and I STILL have not been on all of the rides at Disneyland and California adventure.I was told by a waiter in a local restaurant that their legal capacity is 80000. The park had to at least be approaching that mark as it was a near un sail able Sea of people. The fast passes were gone by early afternoon and in short a highly anticipated vacation turned into my wife and I just trying to navigate a park that I knew I would never be back to. My son (and all three of us) enjoyed the rides we did get onto, and if you can hit the park at a quieter time I would recommend it.But do your homework   we were there for the first week of October and found out while there that Arizona students have a funky school year and that they were on a 2 week break (I'm from Canada and woulddon't have guessed in a million years that that could be a problem). Also discouraging was that I did ask 3 different staff members at Disneyland and they said that what I was seeing is normal... I hope not, as I honestly wasdon't seeing a lot of smiles on people's faces.Conclusion: I loved the rides, but I hate insane crouds. If you go during a busy time you are basically paying $1000 for the 'pleasure' of being in lineups.PSDivide their 80000 people capacity by the number of actual rides.. I doubt the math will look great.",1
"I went with my daughter and son, 10 and 14 years. My daughter had n OK time for the 7 8 hours we spent at the park. My son and I thought it was terrible and a huge disappointment. They let so many people in that the lines were 45 100 minutes to all the fun rides. We managed to go on 5 not very funny rides in the six hours within the park. The rest of the time we spent getting back and forth to the parking lot, even though the shuttles ran frequently. We had two meals. No details but we finished them mostly because we were hungry. Positive:We wathed a 15 minutes show that was good fun and I liked the shapes and designs of some of the rides(the monorail and the old futuristic tomorrowland). I think I have never spent 450$ worse and I cadon't remember last time I wasted a day that thoroughly. Sorry.",1
"We went on a weekday, but the crowd was overwhelming! (See crowd behind statue in picture) Crowd control only applied in the afternoon, where they implemented one way traffic control. Selfie stick was not allowed into the park, which is understandable. But there neither lockers outside to store it, nor they let u leave it at the office, which is quite lousy customer service.. :(Rides are generally less impressive than Universal, & as per all theme parks, souvenirs are at exorbitant prices.",1
Not worth the cost of the ticket. You pay full price if you visit the park during the day but have to leave by 6 pm. Then pay another $89 to stay the rest of the evening. Furthermore Disney allows those who purchase the Halloween party tickets to come into the park beginning at 3 pm so the park has 2x the guests during the overlap. The halloween parade at night is quite dark and not nearly as good as the electrical parade. You will wait in long trick or treat lines to get candy that is nothing you coulddon't get in a fraction of the time in your neighborhood. This is nothing but a money making scheme by Disney at the expense of its guests. ,1
"Well this will be our 3 trip to California Disney park and our last , It so not worth the money , to many grown adults with NO CHILDREN wait for kids rides ! Why does grown adults of 30 plus years want to got on the tea cups or dumbo rides ... ? Or worst still que to meet Micky mouse! They make the que lengths even longer, it hard enough keeping toddles in check without having to wait for 40 mins or more for rides and to meet characters . I feel that a lot of the rides are out dated and modernisation of a lot of them is well over due ,Disney is def look old and tired, come on Disney An overhaul is well over due ",1
"Most disappointed that our two little ones were so badly served at Disneyland. Waiting in line for 45 mins for the Dumbo ride not fun, and over in a flash. Waits for the toilet and to eat in a restuarant added to the woe. By the time we had worked out that fast passes could be issued for some rides, it was too late, they had finished. All in all, bad value for our particular family group. We heard people say it was exceptionally busy yesterday. We had travelled from UK with our grown up children and 2 grandchildren aged 2, and thought we'd treat our family to a magical day. It did not live up to expectations at all.",1
"Too many people, Way too expensive, poor service, and no chance of actually seeing all there is to do, Disney should reevaluate their reasons for having these parks, yes it about money, but surely value for money should be looked at there is no way this place is memorable to children as most cannot get near any of the shows as there are just too many people allowed in at any one time, for more read my review on the California section of Disney unless you upgrade to Vip status dodon't go you are wasting your money and your children will be disappointed.",1
"Its not worth to spend hundreds of $$$ and all your energy just to waste most of day in lines waiting for quick rides. Also some ride areas were closed or experiencing technical difficulties while we waited in lines. We had fun time @ disney cruise and disney world but  Disneyland, nightmare come true . Disney should find new ways for better experience to visitors otherwise its way overcrowded.",1
We were sitting near the bridge where you can see the melody of colors far from their arrangements for fastpass (which could be obtained without extra cost). There was one hour left and we were told be a guidw at front gate that you can still see the show but will not be able to see it from closer if we did not get a fastpass. The medlody of colors arrangements crew started telling all the people sitting there to leave...,1
Nightmare at Disneyland we have been asked to leave five rides because they broke down we are standing at the speedway now number five Break down somebody needs to do preventative maintenance we have visited Tokyo Disney and Walt Disney World in Florida it has never happened there for us they keep on saying safety but I think you equipment is old and not taking care of very well,1
"There is a good reason why the commercials on The Disney Junior Channel show Walt Disney World and not Disneyland.This review is for both the Disneyland Park as well as the Disney California Adventure Park. I coulddon't discern one park from the other. We had the same lame overpriced experience in both parks.Some people that are part of the Disney cult (that is the ones wearing the overpriced Mickey Mouse Ears and t shirts) that will probably be appalled by this review. But I can honestly say that I absolutely coulddon't wait to leave the park each day (on a 2 day ticket). If I was given free tickets and vacation time to visit the park I woulddon't go back.The best way to describe the park is: 1. start with Disney World 2. shrink it to a fraction of the size 3. add more people and fewer attractions 4. add a fair number of homeless people outide the gate5. charge more for the same quality hotels.It's a great experience if you want to wait an hour and half in the Mickey Mouse house to see Mickey for 1 minute. There was absolutely no indication outside the Mickey Mouse house of how long the wait would be (when there were indications of the length of the queue they were way off). We waited in line about 30 minutes for a 3 minute kiddie train ride. Even the caurosel had a 10 minute wait. There was a 40 minute wait to be seated in overpriced cafe   so my family opted for 2 lemonades, 2 pretzels, and a hotdog for $29.  They do offer the 'Fast Pass' which is a good option for the more popular attractions. Unfortunately, this option is not available for most of the toddler attractions.This was my first (and last) trip to Disneyland. Because I've been to Disney World in Orlando many times the comparisons are inevitable.I'm not a Disney person. I first went to Walt Disney World in Orlando in peak season(as part of a sports team visiting the area) when I was 17 and I diddon't understand all the fuss. I preferred Busch Gardens, Six Flags and (what were then) local places like Hershey Park. I'd give the Magic Kindom a B . Epcot was more to my liking   probably a B  and I'd give MGM studios a B. BTW   I had a better experience at Universal Studios versus any of the Disney Parks. Over the years, I've been back to Walt Disney World for conferences and such. I like it but dodon't love it. However, it's superior to Disneyland.On top of it all, Disneyland is a total rip off. $568 for a 2 day pass for 2 adults and 1 child (and that wasdon't a park hopper pass with AAA discount). Once you add the price of the hotel for 3 days (about $900 with tax) the 2 days at Disney costs $1500 (prior to food and transportation). BTW   the Marriott Hotel was actually the best part of the stay.A good family vacation? Standing in line for 30 minutes for a 1.5 3.0 minute ride?Not for us. Yosemite is a good family vacation. Sequoia is a good family vacation. Hawaii is a good family vacation.Sitting in traffic is preferable to Disneyland. In either case, not much is happening most of the day. At least when I'm sitting in traffic I have air conditioning and music.Fortunately, we went to Catalina Island after Disney. We spent much less money. We ate better food. We got to see live wild Bison which is much more exciting than seeing someone dressed up in a mouse costume.",1
"Visiting during the summer is not wise. Seriously overcrowded with rude people, and Disney just packs you in. The result is long lines for rides, and if One ride is down (or two of rides as was our case   Indiana jones and the Train  then the lines are even longer. I would visit during the slow periods in the fall, and call ahead to make sure the rides are working.The poor quality of maintenance of the rides leading to high down time and no Disney discount when rides are not working makes me no longer interested in visiting. Thanks,Disney for the memories.Maybe open a new park and place limits on attendance......",1
"We spent the summer at both parks but for some reason majority of rides and shows were  being repaired   , cancelled or closed. This was ridiculous. No fireworks .. Running back and forth for no reason . Wodon't return !!",1
This parc is overpriced and overdate. THE security is overreacting when you have a monocles. You have to bring iT back when you take it with you. Cost you one hour by tram.  105 dollars P P P d for one parc is to much,1
"Disney attractions nowadays can only be loved by the innocent, the oblivious, or the numbed. While Disneyland is always physically very clean, and the high prices thankfully keep most of the riff raff out, I cannot visit the park without remembering all that Disney does    as a company    to attack the innocence of children and the unity of the family through its programming, its movies, and its social and political agenda. Disney employs thousands in my beloved Orange County    but being a lynchpin of local economies doesdon't and cannot excuse their behavior as a company. If anything, their status and importance calls them to something far greater. Social duty. Social responsibility. As far as I'm concerned, Disney uses its power for many disastrous causes. I cannot    in conscience    support their activities, and cannot close my eyes to the spectacle of their television shows, their animated features, and their commercialization of everything they touch to the great detriment of art and creativity. Quod scripsi scripsi. ",1
"So what can I say about the magical place on earth....terrible,for the money spent on getting in you would think that things would of gone smoothly, when coming to the park it wasdon't to bad, but finding half the rides being closed because they were having problems and the staff being rudeThe entire place is just a shopping area with hardly any rides and with the money you spend to come in I do think that it's a waste of money. When it came to the night parade the staff were very rude and would snap at you if you stood in the wrong step and would shout if you tried to stand anywhere, josh who was outside the penny arcade area really made my time at the park a bad one and i would return again, when trying to enter one of the shops a staff member shouted and said I coulddon't enter. The fireworks display was cancelled and a poor light show was given that lasted 2 minutes.I've found that this is not the happiest place on earth more like the dullest and rudest place on earth that just wants your money ",1
"we spent an entire day at the park waiting for the fireworks scheduled for 9:30, at 9:25 we were told that the firework show might be cancelled. What a shame, we waited all day, only to be disappointed. Take plenty of $$$$ if you have to feed your family, a slice of cardboard pizza cost you $8.00. Next time we will spent our vacation at knott's berry farm, much better deal.",1
Hot. Little shade. Huge queues for everything and very expensive. A people factory of biblical proportions for misery and wages removal. Go to the beach instead. Go to a museum and see something real and dodon't subject your mind and be body to this torturous day. ,1
My card was compromised and large fraudulent charges were racked up right after paying for our Disney trip. (only charge I used it for). Disney and or Costco Travel wodon't do anything to make it right.,1
"Disneyland Park have sectioned off viewing areas for the privileged. These sections are not open up to guests even if they are not filled. Way to make your guests feel welcome Mickey.In addition to selfie sticks, many things are banned. You are forced to take it back to your car or donate it to goodwill. If you have a kid who wants to have fun with a non Disney approved bubble blower, security may screams at your kid and force you to throw the toy away or take it to your car. It is very sad to see. The little boy did not understand why he was screamed at.Follow all rules and be prepared to wait and wait and wait for your happiness and hold on to your hunger, you poor, unfortunate souls. No all day dinning for you. ;)",1
"I did a lot of research to carefully select a specific set of dates that were identified as the slowest part of the season. The park was once again packed in like sardines, even 1 minute after the park literally opened, some rides had 60  minute wait times as the magic morning people were already waiting in lines. Ridiculous, dodon't waste your time.",1
"If you are going to go to Disneyland, wait until you are in your 60s (by this age, you have learned that patience is a virtue). Or, rent out the entire park to yourself. Anyway, let's start at the beginning, we walk up to a lady behind a bullet proof window with a hole shaped like Mickey mouses head. We tell her that my son is turning 3 today so she tells us we have to pay full price for him. I tried to be nice and even funny but no dice. This woman has worked here since the day Disney opened, and she likely gave birth to Walt Disney himself. She's seen it all and she doesdon't care. So I bought 3 tickets, went to a different counter changed my story and got my son in for free. I had warned my kids of the lineups and I made sure I took snacks and water and anything that I could possibly hold on my back. I downloaded the app to tell me wait times attractions etc. It diddon't help. We went on about 4 rides and waited in line to meet Mickey, rapunzel and goofy, and then we stopped for lunch. At that point my six year old made an executive decision to go back to the hotel and play in the pool. So we cut our losses and left. Later that night we went back but still, it wasdon't for us. We are personally  homebodies  so if you are like us, and dodon't want to hang out with 600,000 people I'd say skip Disneyland, go to the Disney STORE and call it a day.",1
"I have been to Disneyland, about 7 times. I am 35 years old. I recently took my kids in 2014, and had not been in 20 years. The prices per ticket is absolutely outrageous! The adults cost just as much as the kids! They dodon't realize that us adults will not be riding all of the rides? Without us adults, there is no kids at Disneyland. We along with our kids should be half the price of what they charge. Tickets should be below $50. They make so much money every day, and they feel the need to charge $100  a ticket? What planet are they on? We went in April during school, during the week, and it was still crazy busy! I cadon't imagine a weekend, or summer, or a major holiday. They say they raise prices to keep people from coming? Really, well it isdon't working. They need to limit the capacity by the thousands!! So people can enjoy themselves, not stand in lines for HOURS! We were there 10  hours, and found ourselves chasing the clock. It will never change, it will get worse by the day, and has been bad for decades. The sad thing is, its become about the money, not about the kids, or the park. What would Walt Disney say? I wish more people diddon't go, but if you want to, you will spend a fortune. The other thing is, the majority of us are traveling from afar, and spend a fortune just to get there, but local residents get discount? Really? You know, so anyway, yes fun place, but too many people. Universal was just as busy, but at least a little cheaper.",1
We have been you DisneyWorld over ten times. However this was our first trip to Disneyland and we absolutely loved it. Our kids had so much fun and enjoyed every second. The lines weredon't too bad and the weather was great. The park was clean...More,1
"Terribly overrated, over crowded, 120 min wait for crappy rides, herded like cattle, expensive for what you get, horrible food and a complete waste of a day.   Heaven forbid some major incident would occurred in the park, people would be trampled.  This is almost as...More",1
"I went to disneyland in Paris 5 years ago. That was the funniest day ever in my life. One week ago, I recommended my friends to drive to California to go to Disneyland. We drove more than 1,100 miles to reach to California disneyland in Anaheim, 50 minutes south of LA . It was nothing like my experience in Paris. In a very ridiculous way they make money out of people. They divided fun rides into different parks to make people pay for more than one ticket. The ticket for the one park is $105 for one day and the interesting part is that you can not even enjoy the limited rides because they sell thousands of thickets which is hundred times more than their capacity. People are all going around in the park instead of having fun. You have to wait approximately 2 hours for each ride on a week day. I can not imagine how it would be on weekends or holidays. Personnel and selling people are grumpy and obviously are not willing to answer people questions. I have no idea how is the disneyword in Orlando but for sure disneyland in california does not worth to try. It's not OK that they makes crazy lines of people who are suffering from pain in their legs because of too much standing in the lines to get a 3 minutes ride! Even it's not that much hard to fix the situation, at least they could sell thickets according to their capacity or they could put something that people can sit on when they have to wait hours in the lines. I understand families go there because they want their kids happy, but I really think it's the time to boycott California disneyland until they make some improvements in their services. Last year, I went to universal studio in LA, totally worth it, definitely better way to have fun. Hope it helps.",1
We are Disney fanatics. We have been going since disneyworld opened. That's the problem. Year after year it gets more and more crowded. Disneyland needs to find a better solution to entering the park magic bands? They need to limit the people we literally only rode a couple a rides a day need better fast pass system like Disney world. Our young grandkids could not stand in 50 60 minute lines. I love Disney I love Mickey but please do something to make this better we could not move with our stroller ,1
"I've always loved Disneyland, having visited the California park twice as a child and the Orlando resort twice in the last 4 years, on a recent trip to LA I thought I would re visit the original Disney. Big mistake and an even bigger waste of money.Once through the gates it becomes very difficult to negotiate your way around the park as you are met by a sea of people, push chairs and scooters. Queuing times for all rides were in excess of an hr and this was mid week out of peak season. After 7 hrs in the park we only managed to get on 4 rides which was quite annoying given that we'd paid $135 for a ticket.When the parade began things got worse as a melee of people gathered to watch it and a stampede began during which I witnessed people and bollards being knocked over several times. There was little crowd control and it was quite apparent that too many people were in the park.If you want the Disney experience visit Orlando. Disney California is a waste of time and money, greed has removed all enjoyment. You will queue excessively for rides, queue for ice cream and even queue for the toilet. Not a pleasant way to spend the day.",1
The title says it all. Hard to experience the disney magic when your getting trampled by crowds and have to constantly watch for strollers   or get run over! sad to see management destroy something that once was great.,1
Everything was broken down or closed. What rides were open we had to wait 45 min or more in line for rides that are a minute or 2 minutes long if we were lucky. Peter Pan ride is what we really wanted to ride because it's new and on my map it showed the ride to be open until park closing time. (10pm) we went at 8:45 and they were already shutting it down. We paid a LOT of money just to fight crowds and to find out nothing worked or was closed. You could not pay me to go back.,1
"Bad. We went during the week and encountered a sea of strollers and Walmart scooters everywhere. Long queues, fast passes are nonsensical and give no advantage as he estimated times are very inaccurate. You're better off waiting.Staff are very un enthused  overall had a very poor experience. Coulddon't get a glimpse of the night show as people   surprise, surprise   sit on the roads to secure the best spots 3 hours before (!!!) the show, as the Disney staff starts roping off sections, which ruins everything. Cadon't stand and look as the staff rudely ushers you around. What the hell? Double thumbs down.I recommend to go to Disney world Paris, where you actually get to enjoy your visit. ",1
"We were expecting a once in a life time magical trip. We were treated like criminals at the entrance. Strip searched and passing through body scanners. Security confiscated a selfie stick of ours and when we later went to retrieve it, it was not there. Hyperspace mountain had an expected wait time of 25 minutes. After 4 hours of queueing we finally made it onto the ride. Staff member Larry who was our guide on the River boat cruise was very rude and insulting. Several of the main attractions were closed due to being faulty. Not at all what I expected for a $95 ticket fee per person! ",1
"its nice to the locals but not for turistswaste of time go to other parks, its expensive with no reason",1
"Have been to Disneyland before, as my wife is a California native. We have also been to many other theme parks all over the country as well. Now, when one goes to a theme park, crowds and long lines, as well as high prices for souvenirs, food, parking, and entrance into the park are to be expected. However, it was so crowded yesterday, you coulddon't tell where the lines for the rides were, and walking was nearly impossible! In fact, we relished waiting in long lines, because it gave relief from the pushing, shoving, and getting the backs of your ankles run over by strollers! In eight hours, we were able to get on two rides. The part that will keep us from ever going back, though, was at the end of the day. We had a train to catch, and needed to exit the park to catch a shuttle to the train station at 2130 hours. We left the souvenir shop closest to the gate, no more than 75 yards, at 2100 hours.....it took us OVER ONE HOUR to get out of the gate. There was zero crowd control, and literally no way to move. Had there been a fire or some other emergency, there would have been casualties. BTW: we missed our shuttle.Does Disney not keep track of how many people are in the park? Can they not see the streets are so crowded you cannot move? I would advise folks to avoid this place, or be ready to shuffle, jostle, push, shove, be run over, stepped on, walked on, stepped on, and hoping the lines for the rides are long just so you can get a respite from the crowded streets!There were literally children crying and saying they wanted to go home. I guess it's no longer the happiest place on earth....",1
They've made it really cheap for the locals. If you're planning on coming from out of state think twice. It's really overcrowded as your paying way more than the locals to stand in line for a limited number of rides since so many are out of service.,1
My aunt and I met my sister at the grand hotel. We had 4 hours of free parking IF we ate at one of two restaurants. We went to the lounge were we drank and ate and visited for 6 hours. Our bill was $ 314.00. Our parking was $70. No free parking if you dodon't go where they want you to go or stay longer. Ridiculous.,1
"After saving and spending a lot of money and over 13 hours of flying to get to Disneyland from Australia I had two very excited boys who coulddon't wait to explore Disneyland.How very disappointed they were. The crowds were so massive that you coulddon't move around the park easily, all the rides had waits of over 1 hour (some even had 2 3 hour waits)Was extremely disappointing and we will never visit again now, nor recommend it to others.",1
"We have been t Disney many times and are firm fans, this was our first family visit to Disneyland California. We stayed in Paradise pier a disney hotel wish was average and very expensive, but hey we thought we would be on site close to the parks and have the privileged magic hour in the morning. Unfortunately as we only wanted a two day pass we were not eligible for the magic hour! We arrived early to take the monorail to the gate, but hey it wasdon't working that day, or the next day, so we walked, no problem except it was quite a long way from paradise pier to the gates twice a day (we opted for a midday break back at the hotel pool) with two you children (aged 6 and 8) I was wearing a pedometer we walked over 10 miles both days in the parks!But never mind we dodon't mind a walk, we did mind the amount of rides that were not working though, the park was busy the lines were long, we arrived at The starters ride, but it was temporarily out of action, we went over to Buzz, the kids loved it, but the queue was long for early am, we then went to book the Jedi experience, but it was full, (10am) so we headed for atop, but it was closed for refurbishment as was the steam boat, and another part of the park, but it was also closed. We headed back and opted for the less popular younger rides, we got to the front of Roger Rabbit after 30 mins, but it got closed temporarily due to a problem, so we went through to a small world but the wait was over an hour, so onto the carousel, but it got closed as we joined the queue, across the way we joined the queue to something else, but this got closed too! by this point the kids were getting upset we had been in the park over two hours and been on one ride.It was a hot day so we said never mind lets have an ice cream, we ordered four but Enrique must have miss heard me and gave us three, one which we did not want, I apologised an asked for it to be changed and another added, and for the first time in all my experience of Disney an employee was rude to me, criticising me for changing my order, which I had not done. By this point I had had enough! We got the kids ice creams and walk them back up main street, to guest services, I was going to complain, (it takes a lot for me to get to this point) Once again we had to join a queue, even to complain!! After a few moments we spoke to a pleasant member of staff, she said we could have a refund or a few fast passes, we had travelled all the way from the UK, having booked our trip 6 months earlier, we did not know that so many things would be closed for refurb at the time, but even allowing for this we did not expect to line up so many time to then be told the ride was temporarily suspended. We went back to the hotel had a swim and some food and returned later on, to try again, but by this point the queues were still long and other things had closed, albeit temporarily, this time it was the haunted house, the queue to see mickey and minnie were still 60 minutes, and even with the fast passes we were all quickly loosing the will to continue. We returned to the hotel tired and fed up. A very sad day day, as the Magic had gone! An expensive dissapointing and miserable day.",1
"Disneyland and Park are still living in the 1980s  pre internet, pre overall technology when it comes to their offerings of rides that have been there since I was a kid, however. The tickets prices have been on a VERY STEEP RISE. The value is just not there, especially when you find the management doesdon't care about the LONG LINES and the countless hours people wasted for a 90 sec. to 5 minutes rides. Theme parks in Dubai and other countries are light years ahead in terms of innovations and technology usage. Disneyland is a legacy, and it's milking that legacy to the last drop. Fantasmic show is the same since the early 1990s! Soaring over CA is the same too. How hard is it to update the two shows and offer different versions? I had to go for some family reasons, but if it wasdon't for that, I DEFINATELY wodon't go.",1
"Quite frankly it's hard to say it's the happiest place on earth when the average wait time for a 60 second ride is 45 minutes. And we diddon't even try to go on rides that were popular, those wait times were rediculous. One of the very few positives about Disneyland are the characters and getting pictures with your child with those characters. Each day there are times and locations of where those pictures can be obtained. However, the character are rarely there and they are never there at the times that they say they will be. If you see a character and want a picture, sprint to try and get in line. Odds are that if you see the character when they first come out, you will get a picture. If however, you see the character already in he process of taking pictures, the line has already been cut off and you wodon't get a picture. Simply put, the character pictures are a huge part of the appeal for my son, he loves the Disney characters, but we cadon't get him a picture because of the reasons listed above. There are too few characters on a whole and their limited availability makes the issue much worse. I do understand the issue of someone having to dress up in a costume and that it's not pleasant, I support them not being in those costumes for extended periods of time. I'm just saying, get some more people to play those roles so that people can actually get pictures with them.Disneyland park is severely outdated and has ridiculous wait times. California adventure is more wide open but is limited in their offerings to young children. For a 2 1 2 year old, you can do the whole park in less than 2 hours, there just isdon't a lot available to them. My son loved the Disney Jr. Show, I highly recommend it for parents of children that like doc mcstuffins, Sofia the first and the Mickie mouse club house shows. Put simply, the is insufficient value at these parks to warrant the enormous expense that people are asked to pay. I would not recommend anyone go to either severely overcrowded park.",1
"It cost us nearly $500 NZ to go to Disneyland for one day. The park was insanely crowded. We managed three rides, as the queues were hours longs. Aside from the rides, the rest of the park is over priced souvenirs and food. Totally not worth $500 or wasting a day on. Several 'attractions' were closed, but you were allowed to walk on them   seriously what is the point of walking on a stationary riverboat or steam train.",1
"I normally go every year! No more! This place is terrible. Lines, crowds, ticket prices...   we have a lot of good memories, this last trip  was ridiculous.   Ski trips will replace Disneyland! They can keep it.. to bad it went so downhill...",1
Used to have passes for Disneyland and as the cost went up so did the frustration with the crowds and lack of service from the park.  We'll be sitting this one out for awhile.,1
This place is a rip off ... Overcrowded and does not reflect Walt Disney vision ... Most of the staff are so inconsistent with info it's deplorable ... Will we return ? NEVER,1
"We have been traveling to Disneyland every couple of years or so for a while, not to mention the times we went as kids, and we've noticed the  cast members  growing evermore disgruntled. The last three times we've been there, we've dealt with rude staff and unhelpful customer service reps. We're done with DL for the moment. I cadon't say we'll never go back, but we wodon't until some retraining happens.",1
"Star Wars Land Construction will forever change Walt Disney's original vision for The Rivers of America and Frontierland. The Disneyland Railroad, The Mark Twain, Pirates Lair at Tom Sawyer's Island, Fantasmic! And other attractions are closed until at least April 2017. 1 3 of The Rivers of America will be removed to make room for  Star Wars Land  Breakfast is permanently discontinued at The River Belle Terrace. The least expensive lunch item at The Blue Bayou is The Monte Cristo Sandwich for $27, Expect high prices and overcrowding indefinitely.",1
"Way too much money for what you get, long lines, fast passes that are for the elite only and the normal people who pay 150.00 a day for a park hopper are call standby riders. Way too many people in the park, seems the happiest place on earth ISdon't.",1
"disney does not limit sales so they pack the park full daily and then you have to compete with thousands of people in line for each attraction...in between you are treated rudely and hollered at by crowd control as they herd you every which way because of the parades that are never ending and that if you dodon't get a seat several hours ahead of time you dodon't see, the herding continues for fantasmic, and again for the fireworks where you are placed in roped off pens as crowded as a tokyo subway car ..if you deviate the crowd control people are downright nasty...none of this occurs at disneyworld in florida... this place has made a quick trip downghill...amazing what corporate greed can do to a good time",1
"We went the 1st week of February when it was supposed to be quiet and then Disney announced  annual passholders  month. It was the busiest I've ever seen and we've been going for years. Parents are so rude, learn how to get into a line instead of pushing you, your husband and your double stroller through in front of everyone else for the security check line. I think everyone would benefit if they would walk on the correct side of the path. So many people walking at you and they act like you're in the way. Cast members are grumpy. None of them were smiling. Sat on a water bottle on Haunted Mansion, handed it to the cast member and she says  oh, thanks, I've always wanted one of these  not sure why they've given up cleaning rides. Not sure if or when we'll go back, prices are so high even though so many things were shut.",1
"I grew up visiting Disneyland in the 80's, once per year, every summer age 4 12. It was magical. You never knew what character you might happen upon! I remember using ticket coupons and then it was open admission. The best chance of catching all the rides was to wait for the electric light parade at night and ride the rides during the parade. I tried to hold onto this with my family this time around but ultimately what we will remember of our visit is the LINES and the CROWDS. Show up an hour before the gate opens? You have a line a 1 4 mile long. They let you through the bag check only to put you in line to get you into the park and then wait in line again. It's a gigantic crowd control experience. They let SO many people into the park   I've heard upwards of 80,000 people per day? It feels like it... lines for everything. Dole whip? Line... Ice cream? Line. Princess or character? Line. Bathroom break? Line. Fast pass... just keeps you running around the park thinking you are entertained. You might be lucky to ride 5 8 rides per day. Break that into hours spent in the park. 12 hours they are open on a weekday, you will ride a ride for 35 40 minutes total out of 12 hours. I love Disneyland of the past. I dodon't think I'll go back, ever. It's too commercial. It's far too crowded. It's a very expensive trip. I can only hope my kids still believe in the magic but for me... I'm sorry, the magic is gone. If you do go.. rent a stroller for kids under 6. Bring your own water snacks. Plan dinner and dodon't miss the best hours of rides between 5 9. Go back to the hotel and swim and rest during the heat of the day.",1
Someday Disneyland will have to admit it cadon't squeeze that many people into one place. I wish they had an app that told you how full they were so you dodon't attempt to take little kids in the heat on a super busy day. It's miserable. ,1
"Magic Mornings are a joke. Disneyland does not open all security checks so lines back up. They cannot move the people in the entrance gates quickly. Long waits to enter sets a bad tone for the day in  February, which has fewer visitors than other months.The happiest place on earth, has cast members yelling at a 2 year old pulling on the rope that he is holding to end the line to visit Buzz. What does one expect from a two year old who is waiting in yet another line.A very nasty cast member in city hall refused to discussed disability access when asked questions based on written material that disney publishes on their website.So much for the happiest place on earth.",1
"We purchased a 1 day park hopper pass at $155.00 EACH. We entered Disney park and waited in line for our first ride for 40 min only to have the ride break down. Then to space mountain, the sign said 50 minute wait time. We waited 55 minutes to only find out we are only halfway to entering the ride building. We waited almost 2 hours for that one ride. A few rides were closed and for what they charge to get in the place I cadon't understand why they cadon't fix these rides. Off to California park, not as crowded as disney that was a plus but wait time were just as long.The cost of the park is not online with the experience you will have. A family of 4 will have spent a thousand dollars consevitivly and only get on a few rides and probably not the ones they want.",1
Steer clear of the new year time period as we had four days of not being able to access rides and fireworks cancelled with no notification. In queues many times for over an hour to have the ride break down and having to start again. Too many people with rides not always functioning. Was a major disappointment.,1
Visited this place with little children.  Very disappointing that most of the rides and attractions were blocked or closed for renovation.  I was not told that when i booked the tickets online.,1
After traveling to many different places in America recently we decided to visit Disneyland and California Park at the end of our trip before returning to Australia. We were very disappointed when we arrived with prepaid tickets to find out that between the two parks there were 12 major rides closed. I cannot understand how they can charge the same price and close so many attractions?We complained but very little understanding or compassion was shown. I will certainly be advising anyone who is planning to visit to phone before buying tickets to find out which rides are not operating.,1
"We are a family of 4 ( 10 yr old boy & 13 yr old boy). We visit theme parks all over & whenever we can. I read reviews prior to our California vacation & all I want to know is who are these people giving this place great reviews! Our family all agreed after a very long terrible experience at Disneyland that this is one of the poorest theme parks we have even attend. Dodon't waste your time and money here and here are a few reasons why.1. Get their early and you will still park up high and even further away,,, which makes no sense. 2. Crowds were terrible! Dodon't believe the Crowd tracker sites!! Doesdon't help most half the kiddie rides were closed,,, and yes Disneyland has only Kiddie rides. Not even some good ones for the big kids to enjoy like at Disney World. 3. Oh and again more than half the rides were closed and not worth the $$$$$. The only reason we were there so long was because of the lines. 4. None of the rides were as good or better than any other theme park we have been too. Our kids had more fun at Santa Monica Pier where they sale all ride bracelets for $30.00. 5. Safety violations everywhere and wodon't even go into that.6. Did not see one character in real life all day!!7. the employee did not exhibit the Happy work attitude you would expect. 8. Food was okay & that is where they make a lot of money.9. Got herded around like cattle because they were making a movie so we the paying customers weredon't important enough to care about at that point. We were herded out like cattle though a 20 ft area, major fire hazard. 10. since so many rides were shut down they gave a fireworks show (which they should not matter what) 11. Star wars hyperspace (old Space mountain) was disappointing. 12. The park was lacking in beautiful landscaping that other parks have. The only great thing here was the dang Ice Cream which was a pain to get too because it was blocked off for taping. I could go on and on but I think that is enough.We left this place so stressed, ripped off and frustrated that after this experience my kids were given the choice to come back the next day to visit adventure land.... none of us wanted to go back to this park or any Disney park. We went to Santa Monica Pier which was awesome !! The only thing MAGIC here are the good reviews, probably by people that dodon't visit many parks through out US and want to believe there is still magic at Disney. Wish we had known the negatives prior to spending money & time at this place!",1
"I grew up going to Disneyland, but things have changed so much. The CROWDS, the lines, the prices are horrific. Now there are over 15 rides closed between Disneyland and California Adventure for  refurbishment  and the STar Wars addition. If they lowered the prices, I would respect them, but no, Disney raised the prices. This is such an abuse of the families who save all year to take their kids to Disney and then find out it's too crowded or many of the main rides are closed. Use your money to travel somewhere else.",1
Been coming here since 1955. Worked here for WED in the late sixties. Doubt that I will ever return of my own choice. (Only if a Grandchild twists my arm). No longer a  Park Feel . Just business everywhere.,1
"Over crowded, nothing magical, worst way to experience Disney in my opinion! Everywhere you could see was just a sea of people. 1 2,5 hrs wait time per ride and the ride only lasts for 5 minutes max (that's really not worth the wait, guys). Entrance fee is super expensive ($95) if you could only go to 4 attractions in a day. I've seen families and kids exhausted and not enjoying the park because of the crowds. Disney has to limit the number of visitors per day if they want the customers to enjoy the Disney experience, but NO! They only care about the money going in. Food is very expensive and of inferior quality. I'm not blaming Disney for monopolizing the food inside the park, but come on guys, the food could have been much much better. The park itself is actually beautiful and well made, but the way it managed the experience of the customers was just way beyond horrible. We have vowed to never come back to Disneyland ever again.",1
"We visited Disneyland two days after Christmas and it was the worst time we have ever had. It began with the traffic around and in the park. It was horrible. We expected huge crowds but when you cadon't even walk around the park because they have the lines for the attractions winding everywhere and even worse pushing a wheel chair (which there was no room to do)   it was not a magical day. Then at the end of the day we tried to catch our ride to the hotel and it turned into a free for all. There was no organization and when the bus pulled, everyone rushed for it pushing senior citizens aside. The next day we went to Downtown Disney and they wanted to charge us if we stayed more then two hours   what!   we have never experienced that in Orlando. Our whole group of five agreed that this trip made us realize that we never want to come back here. We will stick with Disneyworld where even on holidays we never had such a horrible experience. We even overheard cast members discussing how certain cast members should have never been cast as characters in the park because they were terrible at it.",1
Got my tickets ahead of time.I trying asking for refund because I was unable to make to work. I called and Email Disney way before my tickets expired but refused to refund me.Just beware of No Refund Policy when booking online,1
"We were subjected to the worst food service on the planet.Everything we ordered was cold and overpriced and the portions were skimpy!Cold French fries are the norm, as well as cold soup. When you have a captured audience they will maximize the profits and nobody can complain.Dodon't get me wrong, the entertainment is amazing and nobody can do it better,but after a hard day of waiting in line and fighting the crowds, one wants to reward themselves with a nice hot meal.",1
Disney security was really good! Felt like they are on HIGH Terror alert!! Very long lines for security bag check. Long slow lines to enter the park. Once in it became obvious that the park is extremely over crowded! We are packed in like sardines in a can!!! Shoulder to shoulder it's extremely unnerving! People are pissed off and concerned about what will happen should an emergency happen! Fast passes for all rides are completely sold OUT by 10am so zero chance the kids can ride any of the rides we came here for so we're leaving. No longer a fun trip for us!Headed back to hotel and home in the morning.,1
"Where to begin? Bathrooms were filthy, park was overcrowded (Disney should have closed it at some point for security reasons, but did not), food was over priced and mediocre at best. Wait times, even with fast pass, were 6 hours or more. This experience was not magical, it was just an overpriced tourist trap!",1
"Disneyland used to be the most magical place on Earth. Not any more. A message to Disney management  too many people are in the park at one time. What a horrible waste of time for our family of four holiday from Texas. We waited in long lines to get bags checked to get in, coulddon't walk anywhere without massive crowds tripping on each other, you cadon't stand to see parades there is no room for people to even stand to see the parades, we got on only one big ride with fast pass because the time limits (oh you have to wait in lines to get fast pass).I grew up loving Disneyland and now my two teenagers have no idea how great Disneyland really used to be, they begged me to go back to the hotel just hours after arriving. I wished we would have turned around at 9:00 am but we already spent hundreds of dollars on train tickets to get there.Please stop letting in so many people bring back the old Disneyland where a family could have the happiest day together (charge me double the price if you have to). My kids were miserable and have no desire to ever come back to Disneyland. So sad for this So Cal mom. Not a happy way to spend Christmas 2015.",1
"We've been here many times and were on their cruise and Disney World in Orlando. It was my daughter's birthday, so I decided to treat her to Disneyland as she has wished. I diddon't mind the extra wait at the front gate to be searched and to go through the metal detector. After all, we are living in different times. But I knew it was a bad sign when after waiting 60 minutes in line for Hyper Space Mountain, we were told that the ride has broken down. By that time, even the Fast Pass has run out. They simply let way too many people into the park. It was so crowded that we kept bumping into people and being run over by strollers and scooters everywhere we went. The lines for all the rides were 60 minutes long in average, and the more popular ones were 90 to 120 minutes long. To sum it up, we were only able to get on 4 rides the whole day. For $99 per person, that was ridiculous! I dodon't think it was what Walt Disney had envisioned when he opened the park. People were being herded like cattle throughout the day whenever there was a parade. Then it began to rain, we were soaked and sought shelter under the awnings at the Main Street to dry up a little. But the  cast members  kept yelling at us and the others to keep moving. I tried to explain to them that the children were wet and we would like to stay out of the rain for a little while. The cast members were unsympathetic and insisted that we move. I asked for a supervisor and they threatened us with security. So we left the park. To make matters worse, there were lines waiting for the tram to take us back to the parking structure. We waited for at least 30 minutes and had to sit in seats that were filled with puddles of water. I thought the hospitality at anything Disney was first class. They even host classes for corporations to teach them about customer service. But I feel that they had become too greedy and let too many people into the park. They diddon't know how to maintain the level of customer service they are renowned for when the weather changed. It was definitely not the happiest place on earth for me, my daughter and her best friend. For the amount of money we spent, we could have gotten better entertainment and treatment elsewhere. I'm afraid that I will join the many Angelenos and OC residents that I know not to ever set foot on Disneyland again. Leave this place to visitors from foreign countries and out of towers, as they dodon't know better. Disney have lost another local customer.",1
"During our trip (on a Tuesday in early Dec when it is reportedly slower) to the park, we were shocked at just how packed it was. It was so busy we barely got to do anything in terms of major attractions. 1.5 hour wait times for most of the big rides. Dining venues packed with lines out the door for places like Starbucks in the park. I mean.. really? We were so irritated that we wrote a letter to corporate advising them that if they dodon't do something to address their  southern California season pass holder  issue, we are never returning. This park is so crowded with locals that out of towners who only get a chance to go once in a blue moon (since its so EXPENSIVE) get shafted. Shame on you Disneyland! It is no longer the happiest place on earth in my opinion because they allow way too many people in on any given day. ",1
"Dodon't expect to get on many rides! For the price we pay to get into park it's ridiculous how many people they allow to cram into the park, how much a single souvenir costs and the prices they charges for their yukki food! It's amazing how many people have to pretend to be happy In The Happiest Place On Earth when being run down by strollers and breaking the bank just to treat the family on what may possibly be some people's once in a lifetime trip. Expect to be in a rush, wait in lines hours long and spend a minimum of $25 on a souvenir ",1
I bought tickets for a friend and I coulddon't wait but I have never been so disappointed. We picked a week day to avoid kids holidays. We hired a car and set off early. The drive is a good bit out of LA. We arrived at a badly organised ramp into an underground car park and diddon't move for 50 mins. It took us almost 2 hours to park. The shuttle to the park took 40 mins to arrive. Thinking that once we were in it would get better boy were we wrong. Starbucks queue was 40 mins to get a coffee I waited 1 hour to get on a slow mountain ride we tried to get fast passes for some of the bigger rides but the time was 4 hours away. I watched kids stand in line for 90 mins and they were crying in the line. We tried walking around the park just to experience it but the crowds were so big that we coulddon't see anything. Badly organised kids visibly upset queues way too long. Save your money take a picture or pay for exclusive access. This ruined the magic of Disney for me ,1
"Disney LA is no comparison to Disney World Florida. LA is small, over crowded and 3 major now working on same day. No evening Disney parade either. This was our 1st visit to Disney Land LA and our last. It did not have the Disney magical feel of Florida, and was so crowded that it was uncomfortable. We paid for a one pass to both Disney parks which are next door to each other. The queues to get in were ridiculous and the rides were so disappointing. We ended up leaving the park after 2 rides and going back to The Disney hotel and laid by the pool. We returned for the water light display in the evening. Again we were all jammed In like sardines, and could hardly see a thing. Sorry Disney you really havedon't come up to scratch this time. If I return in the future it will be to Florida. ",1
"Went to Disneyland this morning as I was suppose to be part of the Veterans Day Salute Program . It turn s out ( with no notice to the public , all entrance  FREE  on Birthdays &  FREE  Entrance to Veterans and active duty has been cancelled from here on in and prices are going to double on January 1st . I have raved about Disneyland here forever as the most magical; place on earth , but now they will never get my money again. I am a retired and 100 % service connected combat veteran and I feel doing away with the  FREE  entrance is a slap in the face especially when you are going to be a part of a program that has made Disney what it is today . Veterans and disabled and birthday folks have had free entrance for ever and now it is gone .",1
Normally love everything Disney. But went yesterday and it was more crowded than ever experienced. My daughter and I got stuck in a log jam of people near haunted mansion and no one could move for over 15 minutes. Really dangerous. Coulddon't retreat just pinned in. The workers tried to get the crowds moving but we're stuck. I'm grateful no one had a panic attack. It could been a Mecca. It's so crowded that people were exited backstage areas. Walt would've been horrified that any guest would see that. Shame on Disney !!!,1
"I thought long and hard on my title, and as have yet, not written poor review for anything, let alone terrible. I just cadon't believe how little customer service there is, how poor the environment and atmosphere is, and that there appears to be no control over the volume of customers (yes customers Disney!!!) who are allowed into the park. That said, my review is not because today (our second day) a Friday, felt so horrendously claustrophobic and inhibiting for our 4 year old that we left after only 2 hours; 1 hour of which was spent queuing for a ride (auto something) that was an archaic pitiful attempt at entertainment, that goes nowhere, does nothing interesting, and ends with disappointed kids, taunted by the prospect of queuing for 80 minutes to get on the Finding Nemo submarine ride. The crowding is so bad it makes you feel very uncomfortable, unable to move anywhere without being pushed or shoved. If you have children who use a buggy (we have 2 kids one of whom does), then maybe wait until their old enough to not....its just a nightmare...you cadon't go anywhere with the buggy, even the monorail makes you fold it to use. I was quite surprised by the number of adults in the park without kids, but hey, its for everyone, I get that, but there really is quite a dominating feel to the park by groups of 'big kids' (read grown adults behaving like kids) who can make for an unpleasant environment. Major Point 1: Mickeys Halloween party   Saved by the Light Parade and Fireworks which are spectacular, and the only thing that makes the price of entry worthwhile. Dear Disney, great work on the lights, theme music and all that, but holy crap, the place is full of grown ups dressed up, barging around the place with bags full of candy. It was the least child friendly thing we have ever done of Halloween. Major Point 2: Disney is designed to get the most money out of you in the least amount of time possible. Given that they own everything, and you pay an exorbitant amount of money to get in, get some staff that actually want to work there. I would say 50% of the people we met who worked there coulddon't appear more pissed off if they tried. The worst customer service I have seen anywhere in North America. Major Point 3: This is NOT a child  centric   child orientated or friendly place to bring small children. It is certainly more suited to older kids above the age of 8. We have a tall 4 year old, but saw several pre schoolers literally pushed out of the way because they were just too short. At least let them down lightly; maybe a sticker , or badge. There are no chill out areas to go with small one's. Be warned, when its busy it is just hellish. This cadon't be right in a park with this much real estate? It is so geared to getting money out of your pocket that you have to really work hard to look for highlights. Last Major Point: The Characters....ABSENT ABSENT ABSENT   I used the Disney app to try and track down characters that my 4 year old was dreaming of meeting, and that are littered all over the 'Disney Marketing videos'....we hardly saw any characters in either park. The most characters we saw was in the nighttime parade, other than that they are noticeable only by their absence. It is quite shocking given the price, marketing and anticipation for the kids that you cadon't find anyone, and the rare few you do you have to que for 30 minutes for the privilege of a photograph.....you HAVE to que because there are so few of them around. Today, Friday 30th in DisneyLand main park, in the space of 3 hours walking pretty much the entire area, we saw Thor and Captain America at the end of a very long que. That was it. After we gave up and decided to leave, we saw a tap dancing chip munk with about 20 people stood around, and a line of 50 people queuing for a picture with a giant pumpkin...that pretty much summed it up for me....Where was Peter Pan, Buzz, Woody, Monsters Inc, The Neverland Pirates, Mickey, Mini, Pluto, and so on. Disney would say, hey they were there, check the app. Well I have nothing to gain by saying otherwise. If they are there you have to search; hard. Which with a 4 year old is not easy in 31 degrees. Shoulddon't the theme park be full of these characters enriching the experience? Halloween Party.....shoulddon't there be trick or treat everywhere along the stroll, in the shops, on the street, like there is in most places outside on Halloween? Not a few special trick or treat trails with a 40 minute line up of immature dressed up adults? Trick or treat is for the kids, not adults for christ sakes. If they could put the effort and occasion into everything that they put into the the parade and fireworks it might live up to the marketing hype. But they dodon't The rides are old and tired and appear to be breaking down or in need of repair, the tickets are over sold and over priced, and the food is mostly over priced with poor service and lack of care. All in all I would not recommend anyone visit Disneyland with young kids. Maybe its a different experience with older, more worldly wise kids, but with an almost five year old that things Buzz Lightyear is a real Space Hero, and who truly believes that there is a Neverland with Pirates, its pretty rough constantly explaining that they must have gone to save the day or be having a lunch break....and sorry buddy I know we've been queuing an hour, but we're almost there....oh you need the potty....and yes I know its scary with so many people...save yourself a small fortune an use the money for an actual vacation...their about the same price!!!!!",1
"There were so many people you could not even walk. It was so hot and muggy and the lines took 60 minutes or more to get to a ride that lasts 2 minutes. We had little kids and the majority of people on the rides andin the lines ahead of us were ADULTS. I do nto think that is what Walt Disney had in mind when he built his park. People were stepping on people, restaurants had long lines just ot get in and sit down to eat and most of the nice restaurants needed reservations, what a terrible thing to do to kids and adults. There was one decent restaurant that did nto need a reservations, had good food and was air conditioned and that was in the CARS area called FLO's. The day we were there i could notget my eight year old sone on a small kids ride without waiting 35 minutes because of all the adults in the line (WITH NO CHILDREN) ahead of us! OMG, what goes on in California. The cost was painful, almost $200 per person per day!!!So in summary:You get to pay $200 per person to stand in long lines, listen to foul mouthed teenagers, get stepped on by rude adults and kids, get refused service at restaraunts because you need reservations, and teams of little female Disnaeyland employees run around and tell you you cannot sit on the wall at mainstreet to get a better view without standing.Not my idea of fun. Would never go back and would NOT recomend this place to anyone. I recomend you stay home, watch a disney movie and be thankful you did not spend this kind of money for the pain.If you want a realy fun experience, go to Kings Island in Ohio, it has more rides, better rides, less people but nicer people and no lines.",1
I have been to Disneyland a countless number of times. This time was unorganized chaos. They seemed horribly understaffed. We were herded like cattle through tight spaces not roped off for parades. Wait times are expected but over 2 hours for mediocre rides is ridiculous. There was garbage all over which just never happens in Disneyland   Not Ever!  Cast members  did not seem to know what was going on and seemed short and frustrated as well. At one point we were pushed by an employee trying to make her way through the crowd. I was waved to exit the park when I was trying to get to the lockers to get my stored items. We finally just left extremely frustrated and disappointed.,1
"i woulddon't recommend going to Disney unless you have kids under the 48 inch height or if you love queuing up for over a hour and half. Disney doesdon't seem to have a shut of point of how many people they let in! apparently we went on a quiet day when ques where still so long! we had the 3 day park pass and did the california adventure park which was okay not as busy as the disney land park. we just left after being in the park for an hour, as i think queuing up for over an hour is a waste of time! even doing the fast passes didnt get you in any quicker and you only really makes you cut 50% of the line. even the ques for food and drink lines were ridiculously long! i would not recommend going to disneyland and think there are far better parks out there!the rides need updating as there old and obsolete! a lot of the rides are not disney based which you would expect to see in a disney park. this was by far the worst theme park i have ever been to!",1
"I did not think it was possible to fit that many people in an open space. It really was ridiculous.  I thought they had a max capacity and that they respected it. If that is the case, they should review the max capacity. It was...More",1
"As a frequent visitor of Disneyworld in Florida and a Disney shareholder, I was incredibly excited to finally see the other side of the country's rendition on the Disney Magic. I love Disney, almost to the point you would think I could see no wrong in anything about it. Instead, here I am to review the park as terrible, and that's even after Town Hall tried to  make my stay more magical  (which, even that, was said with disdain by the disgruntled woman behind the counter.) It started out with a 40 minute line just to park, which cost something like $20, and requires a 5 minute walk before reaching trams, which were another 30 minute wait. My mother cadon't walk well, so this was a frustrating beginning to the day, but we were able to rest. We finally made it into the park after buying expensive park hoppers   9:15 AM. We went to California adventure first because of the crowd waiting to get into Disneyland. Might have been the best part of the day, because the lines at their longest in California Adventure were only 95 minutes... and then we dared to go to Disneyland's  Magic Kingdom  style park. 205 minutes was a normal wait time, and Space Mountain was broken down    then they shut down Haunted Mansion! The crowd was so terrible we coulddon't move, and NO ONE respected my mother's mobility issues. It was like trying to get on the subway in New York EVERY STEP of the way!Problems with the stay, besides the crowd and the wait:  Disney Dining packages were sold out by 9:00 AM.  NO sense of  Cast Member  Pride. The employees in the stores that could not find the product I desired did not call around to try and find it, they shunted me off to the next store in the line, citing time and overcrowding. The actors running down Main Street had no passion in their performance, and even STOPPED LIP SYNCHING before they were even  backstage ! Mickey Mouse himself while singing  California Here I Come  made exasperated hand motions to mock the fact no one was paying attention to him as they waited to go behind the scenes, holding up his hands and shrugging as his voice over claimed  This crowd is bumping!  I wish I had my camera out, it was flabbergasting to witness!  Worst Cast Member Faux Pas: When we asked the Haunted Mansion  Line Starts Here  Cast Member if the dreadful crowds and sea of frowning faces was really the norm for Disneyland, he acknowledged our question by looking at us, SCOFFED, and WALKED AWAY. I cannot explain to you our shock and dismay   this is unheard of in Disneyworld.  Ride Breakdowns and under staffing: 2 rides with  single rider  lines did not have them open due to  under staffing,  according to the ride Cast Members. The only saving grace is that the  food court  area in California adventure had good food in good quantities for very reasonable prices (though drinks were a bit obscenely priced at nearly $4 each.) Normally I would give another star at least for the fact that, at the end of the day, we did make a complaint and someone did try to 'remedy' the situation. She offered fastpasses on our card for rides that were closed down, however, and the dust caking the entirety of Town Hall   the moldy air vents made an uncomfortable conversation worse. She was begrudgingly helpful and offered as little as she thought she could get away with to us. Disneyworld   whenever we have even the smallest problem   sometimes goes above and beyond to fix something we diddon't even complain about! Here we were having to suggest to her what she do to make us whole... in DISNEY!! If you're familiar at all with Orlando, the service bends over backwards to make your stay valuable and magical. This woman just wanted us out the door! And she took us out, too... after issuing new park hoppers to  try again,  she invalidated our current ones and escorted us out (amicably, granted) and finally offered a SPECIFIC apology for the evening, which she turned somehow into a remark about Disneyworld, as if we were spoiled by it. I am sincerely hoping that was just my take away of it, and not her actual intention, so i'll offer benefit of the doubt there. Honestly, I'm not sure we'll ever use our  try again  park hoppers to visit a place where the Cast Members dodon't even attempt to care about the Disney mission, and I sincerely regret having wasted our money on the parks in the first place. We should have pressed for a refund instead. The UNHAPPIEST birthday celebration for my mother on her 60th birthday ever, and it was during their 60th anniversary celebration. Talk about lost potential for Disney magic! Orlando ... we'll be back soon. So long, California!",1
"Very disappointed in the crowds. I expected to wait in lines but the chaos of just trying to walk in the park was unreal. Disney really needs to figure out a way to control how many people enter the park. When families travel a long distance and pay thousands of dollars for a vacation it is frustrating to have so many local season pass holders making lines excruciatingly long and walking from point A to B difficult. Good solution would be to limit the amount of locals allowed in the park per day so that people who are paying full price plus the cost of travel can have an enjoyable vacation.Next problem was the rides breaking down very frequently. No customer service to make it right for people who were significantly inconvenienced by waiting in lines for 1 2 hours just to be sent away. Way too many rides were broken down for very long durations. I get that things break but 5 years ago when we were at Disneyland this problem diddon't occur.Thirdly there is no magic. Difficult to see the characters and they just leave little kids (and big kids) standing in line, disappointed and sad because they diddon't get to see the character. There needs to be more characters out in the park making guests smile and interacting because that is why people go to Disneyland, for the  magic and happiness . Disneyland is far from being the happiest place on earth.Fourth it is annoying when people pay thousands to get there and stay in a hotel have to pay full price for everything and locals who already have less expense get discounts. Why not lower the prices for everyone? A pen that should cost at most $0.50 is $10.00.Fifth you pay for a full day pass but the park closes early and there is no compensation for it. Pathetic. Lastly, the staff in general was neither friendly or rude with the exception of a few. They diddon't seem to care whether guests were happy but they just did the minimal amount to complete their jobs so they woulddon't get fired. Overall, be prepared for uncomfortably long waits for 30 seconds of most likely mediocre experience, extremely high prices for everything, dirty crowded bathrooms, packed walkways, long food lines, poor seating, rides and shows that break down frequently, and staff that mostly doesdon't care that you spent a lot of money to go to the  happiest place on earth .",1
What a terrible experience. The park was oversold. It was solid people. Only got to 5 rides in 12 hours; what a joke. Old Walt would be so disappointed. Spent $100 a ticket for this and $150 for food and water once in the park. Plus hotel. Plus travel. Worst choice of vacation I have ever made in my life. Terrible value. I want to visit an amusement and theme park to enjoy and escape from the stress of everyday life. Instead I was stressed the entire time. It was worse than an LA traffic jam. Everything was dirty too. I will NEVER visit a Disney Park again. Greedy Disney execs have ruined what was a great brand.,1
"Love Disneyland but hate the line ups Constantly when you get bags checked, entrance, rides OMG the early morning are a joke more lineups only Disney open They are catering to locals ( I dodon't have problem with locals but take care of lineups)And the scooters now crazy When people visit from farther way they dont have 7 or 10 passes We pay for flight and motel It's crazy they running at 89% capacity I am very disappointedWe try and go every 5 years as a big group of 20 but I wodon't go back nowI will encourage my kids to go somewhere else and I love Disney",1
"Well Disneyland is wonderful and amazing. It's so much fun for people of all ages and the food is fantastic! The best corn dogs, to sit down restaurants it just has everything you could want and more. And of course the rides. Something for everyone and every age. It's terrible because of the cost. Now the annual passes have become cost prohibitive and I dodon't think we will be going anymore. It's a shame.",1
"We just has the WORST experience ever at Disneyland. We went on a Tuesday it was so jam packed my daughter got injured by someone ramming into her shoulder. There is NO good time to go to Disney anymore. It is only going to get worse when they build the new Star Wars land. I can hardly call it a great time at Disney when your daughter is walking through the rides in tears because her shoulder hurts so bad. You may think this isdon't Disney's fault, but it most certainly is. A park is over sold if you cadon't even move without getting an injury. We will never go back until they fix this. Maybe they need to turn people away.",1
"Let me preface this review with the following information: I have always loved Disneyland with a passion I am a trained medical provider with over 30 years experience I have great sympathy for people who are truly disabled and have volunteered with a local agency that provides guide dogs to the visually impaired. I have raised guide dogs and been a breeder keeper.  I have attended the Disney Institute training required by my employerWe planned this trip to celebrate our anniversary. Decided to go all out and stay on the property for the convenience of being within walking distance of the parks. Also wanted to see the Halloween d  cor and the kids in their costumes as we were there during the trick or treat events (we did not attend, it was an additional fee on top of the passes we purchased, and the park closed at 6pm these nights). As we arrived after the park had opened, stood in line for 45 minutes to enter the park. This was just the beginning of our many  waits  in line. Sure we know about the fast passes but since you can only have one at a time diddon't really help with the lines. I wasdon't impressed with the decorations, expected much more. Due to the drought (I think?) there weredon't the normal beautiful flower displays which add a lot of color and character to the park. For the first time ever, the park appeared worn and outright dirty in some places. The water around the castle was green and there was a lot of garbage, including a dead duck floating in it. Bathrooms weredon't all clean. The areas leading to the rides were sticky and some smelled badly. Not the DL I remember. I was immediately struck by the number of people on scooters and the number of double and triple wide strollers. As safety is the number one concern for all Disney experiences, it became quite clear it was very unsafe due to the number of these devices parked all over and trying to maneuver through the park. If there were to be any kind of emergency many people will be trampled or hit. The park was not designed for this type of traffic, along with the thousands of people, especially in the narrower areas especially in Fantasyland. Had stopped behind a scooter that stopped in the middle of the flow of traffic and was struck from behind by a stroller. Had contusions and a great deal of swelling on my leg that was hit. The  dad  stopped and asked if I was okay, I was nearly knocked to the ground and too shocked to speak, he just shrugged his shoulders and took off. I limped over to sit down and struck up a conversation with an employee who said, I quote  You can go over to first aid and get an ice pack. I'm really sorry but wow, you should see the scooter injuries when they run over someone!  Confirmed what I had thought many of the people on the scooters were dangerous drivers! The second point in regards to the scooters. I'm not talking about the veteran who had lost both his legs and had his own scooter, nor the man who had part of his foot removed and was in a real cast, nor the 93 year old who coulddon't walk. You see if you claim you are disabled you, and your party of however many you want, get to go in the exit and go to the front of line. Furthermore if you truly need a scooter by Disneyland's protocol's posted at the front of the rides, you would not be healthy enough to ride many of the attractions again not talking about small world! This was every time we got on and off a ride we had to wait for people who came in through the exit. In fact outside of pirates there was again, a safety concern, as there were so many scooters lined up to come in the exit that we could not exit the ride. My fav was the lady impersonating a visually impaired person when she was obviously not. Nor did the dog have the appropriate harness or identification. We were having lunch in Frontierland outside. She let the dog off leash (never allowed in public, unsafe for the dog, all guide dogs are trained to leash relieve for this purpose) and let it go into a display under the fence and poop. Right next to where we were eating. Just so wrong on so many levels. I understand DL has areas for therapy dogs to relieve themselves and this was not one of them!The food was good but overpriced by 50 75% with small portions. The service was hit and miss, saw many employees on their cell phones (not their work phones), yawning, not all super friendly as in the past. Also over heard many complaining about their managers or their hours. Coulddon't blame them for complaining about the rude customers because I agreed with them. The magic hour, while a good idea, diddon't work out so well in DL because they had several of the areas closed so everyone who came in early was packed into 2 of the areas instead of the whole park. The 60th anniversary fireworks were spectacular, the other nights not so much. So what has changed? Society? Disney? Perhaps a combination of both. Overall witnessed so many rude people, pushing and shoving, grown men and women running nearing knocking over little kids. The scooter group just really out of control. Too many examples to list after a few days at the park. Coulddon't help but feel ripped off after what we spent for the package we purchased after dealing with the massive crowds and lines. Lastly, will end as most days at DL should with the light parade. We noticed people staking out their spots 2 hours ahead of time so we decided for one night we would do the same. We sat on the ground for 1.5 hours with specific instructions from DL staff that when they told us to stand, we must stand and remain standing until the parade was over behind the white rope and in front of the rope in the back. Where we were standing there was enough room for one person. For safety reasons, no one could sit on the curb in front of us due to the size of the floats. People became frantic and tried to push us from the back, them from the front to take our spots. The couple next to us, an adult and her elderly mom in leg braces and on crutches, literally had to hold onto the light poll as people were trying to push in. Thankfully a security guard was placed behind us to protect us. The parade was about to start and a lady came running over pushing a small toddler in a stroller who she then dumped out as ran onto the curb. Her husband came up behind with a double stroller, the DL employee tells her she cadon't stay there, her toddler in the ground crying, and she proceeds to stand and yell at those of us (who have been there for 2 hours) about her  right  to see the parade and who we were preventing her children from seeing the parade. She then turned and yelled at her husband. Really? So we saw the parade, lasted about 12 minutes, so not worth the hassle and all the people who yelled at us for taking  their space.  We wodon't return until many years later when we have grand kids perhaps by then DL will have figured out how to manage the crowds better. I fear though by then we wodon't be able to afford to go, seriously do not understand how the family's that were there could afford it! Tips: Dodon't plan too much in one day. Best not to have a schedule or be on time limits, that is what worked best for us due to the crowds and wait times. Bring your own food. We dodon't have small children but would consider bringing a small umbrella stroller to store food and water but more importantly to maneuver through the crowds more safely. Go as early as you can. Talked to locals who reported the locals come after school and work thus the park gets busier as the day goes on. Downtown Disney is a nice place to get away from the crowds, but then requires standing in line to re enter.",1
Not convenient at all! My etickets never came through on my email but Disneyland sure charged my visa! They refused to resend the tickets and after encouraging me to do etickets tickets (as not to pay for international shipping to Canada) they said not to worry I could go stand in line with everyone else to get my etickets upon my arrival. Ridiculous.,1
"We have always been huge Disney Fans. It was a joyous part of my childhood, and I was excited to have Disney be a happy part of my son's childhood. People joke about being Disney  crazy with us, having lots of disney toys, all the movies, clothes, paintings, decorations, snack foods, & even Disney stocks. We always have looked forward to our Disney vacations, even though it is 16 hours to get there. However, for the last few years things at the Parks have been going down hill. It has become more of a local hang out, & not the magical place that you feel the excited butterflies weeks before the trip. We were actually very glad when our vacation week was up this last trip. Not that we wanted to go back home to school and work, but we definitely did not want to endure the let down of Disneyland any longer. I never thought we would say that! We have been visiting several times a year starting in 2009. We loved it so much that we started to bring other families with us. But none of our friends & family can stand the over crowding anymore, & dodon't want to waste their money & vacations. No one wants to get excited to see a beautiful parade or go on fun ride only to spend the bulk of your time packed among thousands of unhappy people, & not able to see or do much of anything! Also, with that much over crowding, the cleanliness is not at all what it used to be. Many of the bathrooms last week looked & felt like I was in a road side gas station with the plugged up toilets & trash on the floor. I now see why people associated sickness & desease with going to Disneyland. I am sorry to say that I am cancelling our next vacation reservations, and will have to look elsewhere for family vacations.",1
"I write this as I sit in my Disneyland hotel with my daughter trying to cool down after three days at the park. Each day the high was over 95 degrees reaching 100 with 45% humidity. What I saw in the park were many situations where people's health was endangered by heat and poor park design. I have also been to Disneyworld in the heat and felt comfortable because they were prepared for crowds in hot sunshine.What I experienced was long winding lines difficult to exit in full sunlight for over 45 minutes. Unlike Florida there are no misters (the only one I saw was in Soaring CA). There are also few canvas covers like you see in Florida.. The only transportation option from Disneyland hotel to the parks is the monorail for about half the ten block walk. Today it was closed from at least 3p to 8:30p BECAUSE IT WAS TOO HOT! Instead guests had to walk in the heat, is that safer? There are no trams. The trolleys that used to run down Main Street are gone. When I asked for transportation options in the heat I was told to rent a wheelchair.Most of the walkways are in full sun. Very few places to sit in shade. I saw many infants and toddlers with no hats being exposed to the sun. Several looked pale and lethargic. It was scary. A person I met said they saw an older woman get heat stroke and start convulsions. They tried to help her until a doctor arrived.I know monorails can be designed to run in the heat. I know Disney uses trams in the parking areas. I know Disneyland used to run trolleys on main roads. My only explanation for these lapses is that it forces the crowds to walk past all the stores encouraging people to come in from the heat and spend more money.I will never come to Disneyland in any month that may have a heat wave. This is September and it is still hot. I would hope anyone reading this would not bring their children and expose them to this situation. It just isdon't safe.",1
I used to love Disneyland. I hate to say it but it sucks horribly now. They let it get so crowded you can barely move. They hardly ever change anything so there is never much new to see. What they did change is now you need a fast pass to even see Fantasmic at all or pay ridiculous amounts of extra money for actual seats. They hardly changed anything in Fantasmic anyway. Same old story. Same water effects. You can see much better in Las Vegas. Maybe I am too old for amusement parks but standing in line in the heat all day for two minute rides is not something I find enjoyable. ,1
"I avoid Disneyland during summer because of the heat, no shade, no misters but decided to take my Mom & grandson big mistake we spent most of our time trying to find a place to cool off..no luck there is no shade. We wasted so much time trying to cool off so grandma woulddon't have a Sun stroke! Disneyland you make so much $$$$ off of us put in more shade & misters for us like knotts & universal studios!",1
"Best avoided during any sort of school holiday time. If fighting the crowds wasdon't bad enough, pushing a wheelchair in near 100 degree heat from one broken ride to another broken ride, paying a fortune for cold drinks and ice cream, never again springs to mind. In one day to have space mountain and thunder mountain break down is unacceptable given the entrance cost. Dodon't even mention $17 to park! ",1
"We drove especially for about 2 hours to visit the park. Prices are high but you expect this from amusement parks in the USA . Parking was 17 usd and in the full sun. and there was an convenient shuttle to the park which was already fun. Getting an entry ticket was slow. After waiting for some time in the full sun someone approached us with the message to go to another booth on the other side of the square. This was very unclear though. Finally we managed to get to pay 200USd for 2 tickets    Entering the park it looked very busy. Well this was an understatement. The park was old and small. Everything was very close to each other and there were just to many people inside the park. Busy is not an issue you expect that. However this was just plain madness. To the point of just dangerous full.Waiting time was minimum of 1,5 hours. You could hardly walk so many people were inside the park. We were so disappointed that we decided to leave after 1 hour . we issued an complaint and I must say they gave us back most of the fees we paid to get in. If you want to go to Disney go to Florida. Skip California",1
"Really disappointed with the attitude of cast members at this park. I paid $17 to park in one of the car parks, we were directed to Simba at the end of Downtown Disney near the Disneyland Hotel. This is a very long walk to the main entrance to the park in very hot weather. You can access Tomorrowland from the Monorail Station located in Downtown Disney. It was at this point that I noticed a sign saying  No Selfie Sticks  I approached the security bag search area and was informed that I needed to return this to the car or check it in at lost and found property at the Main Gate. The stick is for my Sony Action Camcorder rather than a mobile device. I asked the cast member why they had put up signs at the entrance to the car park and also along the footpath as you exit the car park. At this point another rather rude cast member said havedon't you seen it on TV, my reply was obvious no otherwise I woulddon't have brought it. I was then faced with another long walk to the main entrance to the park, where I was met with another cast member who struggled to get me to fill out a label and then attach it to my property. Lots of people were bringing in selfie sticks. Whilst I accept the reason why they are banned from the park, I do take issue with allowing people to walk around the park in queues for rides with umbrellas when it is a really hot day. This is far more dangerous in a very crowded park. In 12 hours we only saw one character, Goofy just before the parade. When I visited the park back in 2009 we saw loads and my boy obtained lots of autographs. Having visited DisneyWorld Florida back in 2013 this was a far better experience.Not sure what is going on California but this park needs some attention.I only met two cast members who were extremely helpful during the visit.Very disappointed! ",1
"Pros: hotel rooms were wonderful, hotel staff was wonderful, steakhouse 55 was wonderfulCONS: as many of my readers know I am one of the most positive people and leave very good to excellent reviews. Imagine my disappointment going to the happiest place on earth and having the most horrific and expensive vacation ever. Outrageously expensive from tickets to hotels to price fixed menu's to five dollars a bottle for water inside the park. They also wodon't let you take any food in the park so they've got the racket pretty much set up.Miss information abounds in this enormous mass of parks. Whether it's the Information stand or a friendly cast member on the street; no one gives you the same directions for the same information no matter who you ask. The restrictions on times and the length of wait time on rides, even when you have fast pass, front of the line or upgraded tickets is ridiculous.  the absolute kicker was how truly unhappy and mean some of the park staff were. Including the security gate checkpoint Nazis and many of the staff and in service workers from hostesses to waiters. I found this to be the worst vacation I've ever gone on and would never set foot in another Disney park. Even after bringing it to the attention of supervisors, guest relations, three emails to their offices still no response whatsoever. I would stay away from there and go to any of the other equally as wonderful parks.",1
"Wasted 1 hour driving to remote parking in morning that was counter to all online directions.  Poor planning, poor communications to public, waste of customer money and time.  We travel to Disneyworld annually and this is experience does not meet the standards of Disney.  Boooo",1
"Our visit to Disneyland was a major disappointed. This park was a huge circle of confusion. With thousands of people everywhere pushing and shoving to get to no where. The.ridws were subpar after waiting starting at 45 minutes to over an hour to ride if you dodon't have the additional $60 fast pass. Never saw Mickey, Minnie, or any of the main characters. Every thing was overpriced. The girls were so tired of standing and walking they wanted to leave early. It was just not worth what they charged to be a part of the entire production to park, ride, eat, see shows, and even use the rest room. NEVER going back. ",1
"Long lines, pushy people, short and dated rides, one giant hot mosh pit of humanity....time wasted that you will never get back....the Disney image has melted.How most of the reviewers on here can give this dump a 4 or 5 star rating is unexplainable. You do NOT get much of a bang for your buck, unless you somehow enjoy dangerously high density, rude, cattle crushing crowds, crying sweaty kids, very substandard food, annoying jingles, lack of shade or seating, short rides requiring life wasting long waits.I suppose if you must go, try to go during the extreme off season. Do NOT waste your money, even if you are wealthy, going there during Summer and Spring. Even if you intend to just stroll the grounds or shops, be ready for a sea of humanity with people pretending to have fun. This place is a dump with a cosmetic veneer. Go to a national or state park, or, at the very least, go to an alternate theme park...Universal studios generally has a much better experience...perhaps not as many rides, but they do have themed areas and the studio tours are great.I dodon't drink or do drugs, but in the case of Dizzyland, I'd have to be on something to ENDURE such unneeded torture. I (and others in my small group) realize we made a giant mistake paying for such a losing experience, and will NEVER patronize this nonsensical place again....which wodon't be a problem for corporate Disney...because there are millions willing to take up the vacancies.This is NOT the  happiest place on Earth ....what a crock of crap to any aware, thinking person.",1
We were so disappointed with Disney.  Just one big line (queue) designed to force everyone to spend as much time (and therefore money) in the park.  Walt would feel let down.,1
"It has been said that Disney makes enough in revenue to be able to entirely rebuild the park every 3 days, yet nothing has been added in decades (apart from more overcrowding). It is wall to wall packed right from the start of the day, this only becomes entirely ridiculous once staff begin roping off 2 3's of the walk ways to cater to the numerous parades (why not buy some more land & dedicate a stadium to host parades as most people end up lining up for hours before these parades even begin then end up not being able to even see them as the crowds are so thick). The lines for most rides were over an hour for what ends up being 2 minutes or less of an outdated toddlers ride, i do not know how small children can wait for so long all day in the sun. Prams run you down at every turn & even the queue for lunch took over 40 minutes. No more characters in the park either, you have to queue to meet them (we had a 5yr old so had to meet Elsa & Anna which was an hours wait for a quick hello & a photo). If you add up how much you end up paying per ride it is well over $25 a ride (as the crowds prevent anyone being able to do more than 4 5 short rides the entire day), Just awful, we ended up walking around all day trying to find a queue that was less than a 40 minutes wait before giving up & leaving, never want to go back there again. Universal is far & beyond better in every respect.",1
It is with great disappointment that I need to share the truth about Disneyland. The 'mind blowing' overcrowding takes away from all possibilities of true enjoyment of this park. Walt Disney would be so sad to see the stress that this overcrowding creates for EVERYONE. Impossible to truly experience the original vision for Disneyland anymore. It is gone   thanks to corporate greed . I personally would rather save longer to pay more for the promise of bringing the crowd numbers way down at the park. In present conditions I will not go back. So sad that no one is really paying attention to what is happening .,1
Was there with my two kids and we left after 4 hours. It was simply so overcrowded and impossible to get around. Waiting times for attractions was between 60 and 90 minutes. Shame on Disney for selling so many tickets that their guests get an experience like this. This was supposed to be the best experience of our 4 weeks vacation in the US and ended being the worst.,1
"If you have been to Disney World, you will be terribly disappointed. This park is the original and is frozen in time. There is really only 1 thrill ride   space mountain. Everything else, I would consider a kiddie ride. In my opinion, not worth the money or time. ",1
While Disneyland is a favorite destination for me and my family I find the pricing on nights that they have the Halloween party are not very well thought through. We plan on going in October and on one of the two nights we will be there is the Halloween party for around $77.00 yet I will have to pay a full price regular ticket of $225.00 for a 2 day park hopper when in fact I get kicked out of the park at 6PM for Halloween ticket holders on one night. So if I attended this party that particular day would cost me approx. $189.50 instead of $112.50 for the day night. I refuse.,1
"THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH DOdon't MAKE ME SO HAPPY ANYMORE!I have been coming to Disneyland every year for nearly 40 years now and never seen it this bad before!The family and I was at Disneyland June 24th threw the 29th the parade was going on, and we was riding the train to Main Street at around 9pm, the train let us off, and sense the Main Street Train Station dodon't have a wheelchair accessible ramp and the wife and I had to wait to set the stroller up at the bottom of the stairs.When we got to the bottom of the stairs we had to set up the stroller and was told we coulddon't stand there in the walkway that we would have to keep moving. We told the employee, aka cast member, that we just got off the train and was setting up the stroller quickly and then we would be moving, and was told stroller or not, we would still have to move because the parade was going on and we was in the no parade watching walkway. We then told the cast member we wasdon't watching the parade we was quickly setting up the stroller. She said sorry but you still have to move! We wasdon't even blocking others people from walking by.Disneyland needs to train there employees, aka cast members, how to treat there guests. In the matter of 10 seconds it took to set up our stroller we had 3 cast members tell us there was no standing there. Unecceptable!!!We went to city hall to make a complaint about the parade usher cast members, we told them if they dodon't want people getting off the train during the parade that they should just shut the train station, and trains down during the parade. And that this was unecceptable!!! The cast member at City Hall said she agrees with us and what we are saying, but that there was nothing she could do about the parade ushering cast members. A complaint will be filed with Disneyland corporate office HR Department! ",1
"What an absolutely miserable day we had at Disneyland.We arrived at around 12pm. The park was already extremely crowded, but it was nothing compared to what was to come.I would say that of the next 12 hours we spent at the park, about 10 minutes of it would have been on rides, and we were mostly there for the rides.The park clearly needs a limit on how many people can come at a time. The amount of people that were in the park was beyond a joke. It was to the point where in some places you were unable to move. There are people with prams everywhere, even at 10pm , and in a crowd of thousands of people, it simply doesdon't work. It's a place that is obviously completely about the money and not about the experience.The lines for the rides were beyond ridiculous. At least an hour per ride, and multiple times in line the rides experienced 'technical difficulties', which added an extra 15 minutes   at a time.Though Disneyland is obviously a children's theme park, it is certainly not up to date with it's rides.They shut massive sections and pathways off in the park in preparation for the parades, quite far in advance. How they justify this I have no idea as when thousands of people are at a stand still while there is a massive empty path right next to them, it seems quite crazy.When we went to leave the park, the tram service that shuttles you back to carpark also experienced 'technical difficulties'. Instead of informing us of this, the staff just left us standing there. We would have waited the best part of an hour before deciding to just walk back to the carpark, which was not a short distance. There were thousands of people left having to do this with no communication from the staff. On the walk to the car, we had staff on the trams condescendingly and rudely waving at us and laughing. They were genuinely the rudest people I have come across this far in the States.It would seem that Disneyland is so full of procedure (I can only assume from being Sued) that the staff are essentially unable to make any decisions for themselves. How many Disneyland staff would it take to screw in a lightbulb? I dread to think.I have wanted to go to Disneyland my whole life, and I can say in all honestly that not only was it BY FAR the worst theme park experience of my life, but that it was one of the least enjoyable days of my life. It sure as hell is not the happiest place in the World.Between the 6 of us we probably spent $1000 USD for the day out, which is incredibly depressing considering how miserable of an experience it was. If someone offered me $1000 to go back and do the day again, I would definitely decline.As a theme park, it barely functions, the service is horrendous, and the over all experience is horrible. I could probably go on all day about how much of a let down it was, but I'm sure Disneyland dodon't care, as they already have our money.We would never go back, I suggest you dodon't go either.",1
"We looked for a place to stand or sit 2 full hours before the start of the evening parade. People were already staking out every available spot  looking extremely tired and bored. We crammed into a spot by a trash can. After two hours of intense misery, the parade diddon't begin on time. People streaming in endlessly like sardines. Finally we left, totally disgusted with what a completely miserable 2 hours we had spent. Dodon't go!",1
"Where to start... How about with the apparent overcrowding at the park. The corporation needs to start thinking about the quality of the experience they are offering. There were no lines that were under a half hour, some fast track lines being 30 40 mins long still. There is very little shade to escape the heat. Dodon't bother with the 'cinema'   it's 6 screens in one room showing 6 different movies and no seating  unless you sit on the wood floor. Food lines were ridiculous! Over half an hour in line for prepared chicken nuggets and chips (food quality was good however). The deceptive lines were the annoying part   lined up for the jungle cruise that looked like it was reasonable to find it was a 2 level maze of lines that went on forever... Upon returning to California we will not spend another cent at this park, next time will be Universal or like. ",1
"I purchased 2 tickets for my daughter and my niece online hoping to avoid lines in the morning. I purchased the tickets online. I received a confirmation number in an email saying I would receive my tickets via email within one day. And do I have my e tickets as of 10:39pm PST? That would be a big fat NO. I tried accessing their online chat. That service was not available. I sent an email. I received an automatic reply indicating that someone would reply within 5 business days. How is it I dodon't have my e tickets? Now I actually have to go to the park, wait in line to talk with someone before I can get replacement tickets. Very poor experience. ",1
"I have been to Disneyland many times over the past 50 years but on May 22, 2015 the Diamond Jubilee (60 years) the experience was one of the worst of my life. No fault to the cast members, all the fault lies squarely with management. It was my granddaughter's 21st birthday and she wished to spend it there with family rather than go drinking with her friends. We got our tickets and then the day before we checked with the information booth about the activities the next day and whether we would encounter any problems. We were advised that they would stop admitting guests probably around noon, but that those who had already entered would be okay to move back and forth between the parks, exit to Disney Walk, return to hotels, etc. and still be able to come back into the park. The expectation that the park would reach capacity around noon (Disneyland capacity was 92,000 and California Adventures was unknown by the Information Booth) but they would stop admitting guests so that those who had already entered could enjoy the parks. We left the parks for a brief rest at about 4:00 p.m. and found that there were people waiting to enter (my guess about 10 thousand). When I returned at about 7:00 I had to struggle through a larger crowd (my guess again about 15,000) to the front where I was told that no one was being admitted. At this point all seven in my family were devastated because my granddaughter now would not have her birthday evening in Disneyland, we would not see all the special lights that were prepared for the occasion, and we would not see the special fireworks and other productions. To say the least this was a very unhappy place for my family. I cadon't imagine what all those others were feeling.",1
"It's Disneyland, right? Who doesdon't like Disneyland? I've been there hundreds of times. They over sell tickets. They charge way tooooo much for admission AND parking. Random rides are always closed or break down while you've been in line for an hour. During parades and shows, they heard you like cattle through the street and paths. You cadon't walk where you want to walk, there are ropes everywhere and people with light sticks herding you down paths you dodon't want to walk, and in one way directions. You cadon't stand anywhere. This is as a result of overselling tickets of course. With all of Disneyland's money, is it really necessary to sell so many tickets that there is no enough room in the park for everyone? For the rides, the fast passes are great; you just have to be organized. Not all the rides have them available. Who ever thought I'd be reviewing Disneyland? We and our kids had a great first half. Once the  herding  and  gridlock  started, it was horrible! Not a nice way to end the night! They need to work on this! Wheelchairs and strollers, good luck after 12pm!",1
"Perhaps we've been a little spoiled. But after visiting both Disneyworld and Disneyland, there is no comparison. It seems as if Disneyland tries to cram everything into one park. Utter chaos. Especially when they are getting ready for the parades. So much is roped off, impossible to get from one area to another without so much backtracking & crowds. Did not like it at all. And certainly dodon't plan on ever returning. Give me Disneyworld any day!",1
"Went to Disneyland over Spring Break 2015 with three grandchildren (ages 8 and twins age 2). $500 for 3 rides and lunch! Never, never again! The wait times were ridiculous! In the 70's and 80's, we went with our children to Disney World in Florida    we got  tickets  (the old system) and the days were always enjoyable for them! Crowds are okay    the wait times are not! Disney needs to come up with a better system! What a waste of time and money!",1
"We were really mad when we find out that we spend 93 dollars in the entrance of Disneyland and every game we wish to go like for example  New Orleans Enchanted Mansion  was closed, and another 4 games we like too. In the entrance nobody told you is under construction. I went last year to Disney World in Orlando and is a 10!! Everything is done in the hours before people arrived, nothing is closed unless is something new. Because it was less games to tons of people the lines were more than 1:45 hours to Space mountain, is depressing spend like 6 hours to go to 4 games. In Disney World the lines have the board that tells you exactly how many minutues you will spend making lines. Wifi diddon't work, so you cadon't upload pictures or check out the app that tell you the minutes for the line in the games (Like every park in Orlando). I wodon't recommend it at all.",1
"Went to the Anaheim parks for the 24 hour kick off of the Diamond celebration and it was an absolutely miserable experience. Have been to Disney parks many times in the past so I knew to expect crowds but.... This was utterly ridiculous. Wait times 150 minutes. You coulddon't move much of the day. They had twice as many people as should have been allowed. The poor employees were completely overwhelmed. Chaos set in about 1 am when people just wanted to leave and were not allowed to get to their cars. I was told if I wanted to leave I would have to walk completely around the parks (couple miles), take a cab or just wait in line an indefinite period of time. Each employee you asked had a different wrong answer or no answer at all. For this I got to pay $172... Never again!",1
"Today is the 24 hour 60th celebration. We expected a large crowd, but never expected that when I had to go back to our lodging I coulddon't get back into the park; meanwhile my family was in the park and telling me they were still selling tickets. My family is in the park while I, with a ticket for today, am stuck in my room watching the Disneyland fireworks from my window as I am writing this review. They told my son they were prepared for the crowds; it looks like they were prepared to make money by selling tickets they had no intention of honoring for the whole day.",1
"This was our second annual birthday trip to Disneyland for my daughter, and unfortunately, I cannot write a positive review this time. Not only were the cast members in the Disneyland park incredibly rude and seemingly unhappy in their jobs, which we could have overlooked, we were duped into purchasing an over priced meal that advertized receipt of a Fastpass for Fantasmic, to which we were mislead and believed were for special seating The meal at Aladdin's Oasis was $19.99 per person and consisted of microwaved lasagna, a tiny salad, dinner roll and some cheesecake. The meal, with the exception of the dinner roll, was awful!! And in no way was worth half of what we paid!!! However, we thought it worth it to get a good view of the show at the end of our tired day (mind you, this was the end of our FIFTH day at Disney parks)! Prior to purchasing this barely digestible  food,  we ASKED two separate cast members about the details....not to mention, on the Disneyland schedule that promotes the purchase of food in exchange for a Fastpass, it implies that the viewing spot would be better than if we did not have them. We arrived at the Blue section 45 minutes before the show started (we were told that we only needed to be there fifteen minutes early because we had the passes). When we arrived, we were directed way over to the other side and in the standing only section. W T F?! I spent $60 on crap food to have to stand AND for my daughter to not even be able to see over people's heads?! I dodon't think so!! I spoke with a cast member, Amber, who was as helpful as she could possibly be....however, the other viewing spots she suggested were all standing only. We opted out. Not only was my daughter's view obstructed, her little legs just coulddon't handle it; and quite frankly, neither could mine. I was told that other people who went to the more expensive restaurants were entitled to SEATED viewing  but I wasdon't....because they spent more than me. But the real kicker  the Blue section that we got with our $60 lunch  was the EXACT SAME SECTION FOR THOSE THAT GOT REGULAR FASTPASSES....FOR FREE!!!!!! It's possible that I dropped the  F  bomb at that point. This trip cost us thousands of dollars  and we spent over a thousand dollars during the week we were there....yet Disney is apparently hard up.Guest Relations was a JOKE!!!! The gentleman that  helped  us never once smiled and even admitted himself that the food at Aladdin's Oasis is disgusting. He offered absolutely NO resolve other than telling me to write a complaint to guest relations on Disneyland's website. Given our horrible experience with rude cast members (Amber at Fantasmic was the ONLY exception), the park being WAY over crowded and getting suckered into purchasing a crap meal for crap fastpasses  I'm not thinking we'll be spending my daughter's birthday at Disney next year. It's Southern California....and there are PLENTY of other options!!!!!",1
"Rides were broken down and closed. We waited in line for 45 minutes or more for most rides. One broke down while we were in line, had to wait an hour to get on and it broke down once again while we were on it. No apologies, just got us off, no offer of fast passes in compensation. Way too overcrowded to be enjoyable. No magic left in Disneyland. Coulddon't pay me to go back.",1
"This place is simply way too over rated. Avoid it like plague on a weekend or on a holiday. Long ques for rides , food and even for clicking a pic. Food is overpriced and not worth it.",1
"Waited in line to park, get the tram, buy tickets, get into park and every ride. Spent the entire time once we saw the Disney sign in one line or another. Staff moved like turtles & spent more time talking to each other . $300 for 3 of us. Complete waste of $$$$ as EVERY ride was over an hour wait. Disney should limit the amount of people admitted to the park. 2 rides took hours 36 minutes.",1
"Besides dealing with the line jumpers or cutters, just walking through the park is difficult without getting hit. People will just ram into you like you aredon't even there. This park like many others like it, bring out the absolute worst in people. We were waiting in line for Pirates for about 45 min and when we started to turn the corner a family of five lead by the father cut in front of me and my family, I reported this to a worker but she just said sorry. Its not worth fighting over but it sure got my blood pressure to rise. We will never go back to Disneyland, it is far from the happiest place on earth. The walkways are to narrow for the amount of people. This was not much of a vacation it felt like we were going into battle everyday.",1
"Flew here from NC for Spring Break. Bee to Disney World several times and loved it. Daughter diagnosed I with Type 1 Diabetes last year. Been to Dollywood and Carowinds, both gave us a sheet to take around to attractions where we would be given a time to return to keep her from standing in long lines. Thought it would be same at The Magical Place on Earth. Stood in line at first services to be told no, Disbetes is not a disability they recognize at Disney. Was asked how we typically manage blood sugar, explained process of counting carbs and injecting insulin. Was told too just give more insulin. Was told standing in line would be good for her. Spoke to supervisor and given same bad info. I also called Disney dining ahead of time and made reservations. I was told the chefs could help us with carb counts. Our chef looked at me like I was speaking a different language. Thet turned it I to a challenging vacation where my daughter was exhausted by 2 each day so we left the park.",1
"I'm not pleased to have to report this but if you are planning a trip to Disneyland any time soon I would reconsider. Within one day of arriving home (March 2015) me and my 3 year old granddaughter became VERY SICK! Now the 14 month old is starting with fevers. I dodon't remember ever being this sick for this long and I'm not showing signs of turning a corner yet. As much as I love Disneyland it is definitely not worth going until they clean this place up. I had no idea they have been having problems for months with flu and measles. At the very least they should post a big warning at the front gate so visitors can take extra precautions if they choose to go in. Believe me, I have been so sick it is not worth it!! Usually I would give a rating of 5 but right now I would give them a 0. My rating of 1 is only because that is as low as trip advisor will let you rate. I cannot find any reports from Disneyland itself about this huge problem. They need to inform the public of what's happening within those happy walls and of how they are combatting it. Take my advise. I cadon't stress it enough, you dodon't want whatever it is I have and I'm positive I got it in either Disneyland or California Adventure!!!",1
"We re entered the park around 9pm for the fireworks. Afterward they had the entire street and one side walk roped off for people leaving the park. People entering only had the right sidewalk (Lincoln Memorial Side) and it just wasdon't enough room. Once we got to the middle section near the castle all hell broke loose. We had our 6 month old in the stoller and our two year old riding but standing on an attachment board. My wife and I were walking. People were walking in all directions and were acting very rude. Nobody said excuse me, etc. Many people cut infront of my stroller, etc. When we finally cut across to Adventureland near the tiki room and were headed to New Orleans square things just stopped all together. I guess people were lining up for the Fantasmic Show, but I just wanted to take my boy to the Pirates of the Carribean and the Haunted House. This was nearly impossible and I began to loose my patience. Later after we disembarked from the Pirates of the Carribean, they had my stroller roped off for the Fantasmic and told me I would have to wait 45 minutes to have access to my stoller? REALLY? This is when I decided to just act like all of the other nutballs and I just went over the bridge and around next to the restaurant and grabbed my stroller. We bought some popcorn and avoid the crazy crowds by cutting though the park by the train near the haunted house. We then went on the trainride and the haunted house. After the fantasmic crowd left we had Disneyland to ourselves. We lost at least an hour do to the poor crowd control employed by Disneyland. Please send us some more tickets!",1
"Went to D land on a Wednesday in March hoping it woulddon't be crowded. Haddon't seen the park in over 15 years. It was almost standing room only on Main Street. Calfornina Adventure's BEST ride, Soaring Over California was closed for refurbishing. The Mattorhorn in Disneyland was closed for refurbishing. My wonderful memory of the Carousel of Progress is now a hike up a two story ramp into multiple rooms of corporate sponsored advertising. Overall, total bust for me. I dodon't think this is what Walt Disney had in mind.",1
"I used to love Disneyland however this place has gone downhill. I must know because we go here every year for the past 5 years and this was the worse of them all. Garbage not picked up which is so not like Disneyland. The food and service at their vendors have all gone downhill. Even the people frequenting this place are questionable. Not worth the time, money and agravation. Manh rides are always closed for mmaintenance so you do not get your money's worth.No more Disneyland for us!!!",1
"We recently visited Disneyland for the day and it was the worst decision of my life. So many attractions were closed, the wait times all 45 , so crowded and I just dodon't think it had the Disney vibe. No characters were out for the kids to take pictures with (only in the parade) which was a huge thing for me. It's just a waste of money and I would prefer to spend my money and time on better experiences. ",1
"We did not visit the adventure park so i would not know about that, but  disnayland California  was the most disapointing experience of our LA vacation. Everyhing seemed so worn out and the park itself is quite small. Apart from Pirates of the Caribian and Mystery Mansion (which was ok) the main attraction is a Starwars simulator, which dont compare at all to what you will find at Universal Studios 3d simulators. The park does not compare to Eurodisnay (which is great) our own (Denmark's) Tivoli or EuropaPark. The latter is the greatest park i have ever attended. Save your money and stay away from this disapointing last Century theme park.",1
"There were 9 attractions closed while I was there.  Thus, all the other attractions were really lined up.  Plus the park closed at 8 pm, making less time, less attractions for the same amount of money.  The bathrooms were dirty.",1
"Sad. . . . Really Disney??? I read and updated myself before coming to Disneyland on disability services. My last visit was 10 years ago. This was to be my first visit using a scooter. (I cadon't walk long distances or stand for long periods) and, to Celebrate my granddaughters second birthday. I did what was advised, went to city hall and was met with,  What is your PROBLEM today?  From there, it just got worse. These are just the highlights of what I encountered throughout my one day visit. I am saddened that I was met with cast members who spoke to me like I was a child! I had a party of two adults (me  53yrs old, my daughter 22yrs old and one 2 year old) I have a positive attitude, am courteous, educated, speak well and pride myself on my communication skills. My  simple  question was met with  scolding  tones. I asked the Indiana Jones Ride attendant for procedures and was told,  If YOU are going to ride then . . . I was confused by his tone. Yes, I was the rider. I had help (my daughter) to transfer, but, we also had a two year old who coulddon't ride, so tell me what we need to do . . . It became such a production, I left and diddon't ride. I was invisible to the store clerks in Frontierland who was more involved with their profit sharing conversation and displeasure with the disney company to notice I needed help. I was walked along the whole perimeter of the Blue Bayou restaurant, when I could have easily been taken a shorter way. (I was told it was  company policy ) I found it insulting the host diddon't even wait for me to arrive at the table. They show more care at IHOP. Andy, the manager (who was very apologetic and sweet) gave me a fast pass for Peter Pan to turn my bad experience around, but I really should have left. Blue Bayou was my kids  Treat  meal, I wanted to continue the tradition with my granddaughter, but for a restaurant that boasts excellent food and service that first encounter taught me, you cadon't relive your past. Disney, the icing on the cake was Fantasmic. I did everything I was supposed to. Got my fastpass early. Yellow section to boot. I checked at 5p with the yellow jacket personnel on where to line up and was told,  You line up here at 630p, not at 615p, not at 625p, but 630pm  Really? So i guess the 50  people who were there at 615p wasdon't as fortunate as me to get her memo. BUT that most demeaning, degrading and icing on my cake of disappointment was the attendant who directed me back to the  Handicapped  section, and seated me directly in front of the lamp post. When I tired to explain that my view was being blocked, he cut me off and pretty much told me, he had more people to concern himself with. I spoke with manager after that. Disney, you broke me. Disappointed me. Made me feel like I was a bad child and punished me for being in a scooter. I held my tongue and disappointment for my daughter and granddaughter's sake, but I did the research! I followed the rules!!! We came during  off peak  season, as not to battle the crowds. we paid the same admission price for shorter park hours, but that was the trade off. My sacrifices were for nothing. I will be back, but the next time I will be better prepared, grow a tougher skin, fend for myself and tell everyone I know, my beloved Disney sees you through different eyes when you are on wheels. Even my letter of  concern  was met with a FORM letter of apology and a sincerely worded phone call apology, and then I'm sure was promptly filed in the trash can. Did it get to tghose who could make a difference? Highly doubt it. Even Sadder.",1
"Like California Adventure, Disneyland Park had far too many top attractions closed. This included The Matterhorn, The Haunted House, Winnie the Pooh, Splash Mountain and others. Very disappointing to pay full price for tickets only to find so many rides closed. Pick up your game Disney. You disappointed us big time!",1
"It was my first time and I was extremely excited! We hired a car and in arrival was told we had to go to the Disneyland California park until 3 as the main disney park was full , this was for free and you paid the normal price for entry. We went in and there were queues immediately , for everything , rides , shops , toilets , cafes, even the hot dog stand which for something so small cost nearly $10 ! We went on 3 rides in the California park then gave up as it was 1hr 30   for everything , walking down the streets were so stressful as there were people everywhere , still we were feeling optimistic as we were now going over to the main disney park for (3.30pm) We haddon't seen many characters in the first park and thought this may be because they were in the main park , we went over and there were 3 characters at the entrance , I managed to get a photo with Snow White and then we were mobbed , over 50 people around us in minutes!! It was very claustrophobic and we left quickly , we went to space mountain ride as this looked the best , we queued for 2hrs 45mins in the dark and cold to be told it had broke 3 times and wasdon't working , so we went to the ride next to it and were there for an hour , it was near to 7pm and we decided to leave , there were thousands of people in the park and it diddon't feel safe at all. Before leaving we decided to complain at the main hall just before the exit , the man said the fire marshals control entry to the park , we insisted it was overcrowded and spoiled the park and he said that it was safe and they aredon't letting any more in. We said we had hardly seen any characters and got in no rides in the main Disney park after aimlessly fighting queues for hours. We asked for a partial refund of our $96 dollars to be told there were no refunds allowed to anyone and that he could give us fast pass tickets to 3 rides each , we took him up on the offer, we still waited nearly 45 mins for each ride and 30 mins to get out as the streets were so packed we coulddon't exit till it was safe , the staff were controlling where people go with ropes , (we felt like cattle) , we got on the 3 rides and left, getting back for 11.30pm. I can honestly say it was the biggest disappointment , there was no magic, only stress and money money money, they need to let less people in and make it magical rather than take as much money and cram as many people in as possible. I agree with another statement made on here , if Mr Wald Disney were to see this he would turn in his grave , shame on you Disney managers , shame on you!",1
"I am a pass holder who attends Disneyland often. It was always, a fun amusement park with a lot of magic. Since the recent ADA changes to the park the only magic that I experience is if I can get my electric scooter back to the car. Disney is under the incorrect impression that both parks are completely ADA compliant. Someone collecting a paycheck from Disney as an  ADA Professional  would best serve the Disney guests if he or she would return the unearned paychecks back to Disney. The parks are neither compliant nor easy to navigate either in a wheelchair, scooter or with a cane. The new ADA line system will never provide equal or fair access to any disabled guest. The new line system is discriminative and there is no proper procedure in place. Let me explain, there is no longer a guest assistance pass for the disabled. A disabled person is required to visit the customer care bldg at the front of the park to register verbally what the disability issue is. The cast member types into the computer the disability and places it within the guests ticket for that day or on the pass. The disabled person then is required to visit one of 4 booths within the Disneyland park to seek a 45 minute return pass for each and every ride. Think about this fact: you are disabled, probably not feeling as well as guests who do not suffer with a disability, you have to drive or push your wheelchair to a booth somewhere, get a return time and wait for 45 minutes, while feeling ill, to get on one ride. I was able to go on 3 rides in one day and in doing so my electric scooter died before I could return back to the parking structure to get to my car. Disney does not provide any electric wheelchair charging areas to facilitate the new line system that does not work! What did I do? I had my wife push me back to the parking structure.We waited for 30 minutes to even get a tram into the park because women took their baby strollers up onto the wheelchair ramp to get into the tram.The wheelchair ramp has an ISA for the disabled. Why does Disney staff allow strollers to take up wheelchair space?? A stroller must be empty and folded to even enter the tram. Why would the staff allow a stroller where it does not belong? POOR ADA TRAINING of the staff. Disney needs to get a real ADA trained Professional and make the two parks compliant and have proper policies, practices and procedures in place so the parks can be a safe and equal amusement park for all Disney guests and not just for the healthy.",1
"So, who dare to criticise the magic? Well, if you want to see a princess or Mickey Mouse, you gota make a liiinneeee; like for everything else including the toilettes. I naively assumed that there would be several Cinderella s ( kids would not notice; same as with many Santas in every mall) wandering around the park; NO! Actually the only princess I sow in 3 days was in a parade; where again I stood a line ... We did maximum 8 rides per day even with the Fast pass; since the rides had been braking in front of us; twice literally. I gently complained to staff   really gently since you can not be mad on people who make less then 9$ hour. I was told to complain at California chamber of Commerce. I understand that this overcrowded, overrated attraction can not be perfect, but some discount should apply. Frankly, they should not sell more tickets once the park is crowded; it is only a many machine not a magical place; you can hardly walk, so many people are there at once. oh, do not buy souvenirs there; get them at Wallmart for half the price or less. My 6 years old kids like it; so is done and we move to another   less crowd   adventure; )",1
"We visited on Monday 5th January 2015 with myself my husband ,our 5 children between ages of 4 & 14 two of which have special needs. It cost us $684 dollars to gain entry for the day. We were told before we the day of visit that due to us having children with special needs we would be able to get a pass to be able to book a time on a ride to go back at a later time, what they dodon't tell you is that you have to wait for that ride & ride it then book on another which left us unable to do anything for over an hour after every ride. It was a particularly hot day reaching over 80f & the park was way to overcrowded. The most distressing part was definitely after the fantasmic show not only do they sell everyone out to make you buy extra tickets to be able to see it but as we were trying to get out of that area with a wheelchair a special needs stroller & 3 other children it took us 45 mins to get back to Main Street . I am absolutely disgusted that this place has turned into a money printing factory instead of the happiest place on earth we had the worst time on earth Disneyland you should be ashamed & sir Walt will most definitely be turning in his grave ",1
"We have been going to Disneyland for over 50 years. We have passes and have gone at least 10 times over the year. I dodon't care when you go, what day, what time, it's going to be crowded! I havedon't tried the rainy days, but dodon't plan to either. Yesterday, a Tuesday, it was, once again, unbearable. A 45 minutes wait for Jungle Cruise! That same wait, or longer, for Small World. Parking raised (Again!) to $17. My observation over the past few decades is that too many passes have been issued; too many rides are broken down; Plain food has a gourmet price tagged to it; and an average family can barely afford to go at all! It's plain and simple; Disneyland is geared to profit making on virtually every single event or product it offers.. Everything is tied completely to a profit magin of huge proportions and entertainment is only a sidebar. Disneyland had a great history and a true legend with it's creator Walt Disney. Slowly but surely they are fading away Walt's name and trying to create just  Disney . Most movie releases have only Disney in the logo; no more Walt. It's the sure sign that the genius and human touch of Walt is being replaced by a huge corporation that is riding on the history of Walt Disney, while at the same time dismissing the man and his honor and integrity. We wodon't be renewing our annual pass this time. Why pay hundreds of dollars to be hearded around a cement pasture like cattle?",1
"We have passes and have visited and rated the park earlier, and have tried to be nice about it. The last 2 times we were there the park was so OVER CROWDED that we felt UNSAFE. When you cannot move to leave, or to walk, it's unsafe. People were everywhere, and just to get out of the park took us over 45 minutes and we only had to walk from the castle to the exit.  We wanted to see the Christmas decorations too, but it was impossible.  We chose to walk to the parking area, because the wait for the trams were almost an hour, and it was no where near closing time.  The first thing you smell as you walk thru the tunnel into the park, is the sewer. Actually, through most of the park, that is the smell.  Even tho we have passes, we wodon't be visiting again for a long time. It's just not worth the stress and the time.",1
4 hours wait and they said that this is the happy place ??? No for me and my kids.Btw when I found one place to sit ( floor) they removed me because   safety   What about my legs after standing 4 hours ???? Will never come back again.,1
"Our expectations were not that high, but we were sorely disappointed. At almost $100 person for tickets, three grandparents, two aunts, two parents and a 3.5 year old arrived at the parking lot at 10am to enjoy a memorable day, as we are rarely all together. It was December 29th, so we expected crowds and were patient and jovial until the Disney staff managing the line for tickets tells us that we wodon't get into the park until late afternoon; he cadon't (is not allowed) to tell us when. Waiting an hour to find out how many hours we would wait to get into Disneyland was frustrating enough, but his attitude was belligerent and unhelpful. He did tell us we would be given entrance to a back up park co located and Disney owned next door for the same price as the Disneyland ticket. We finally got into Disneyland when it was dark and cold at 5:30pm when we should have been heading home. Meanwhile (adult) friends bought tickets on their phones hours after we did and were admitted immediately. This is just unfair, and not what the 'happiest place on earth' should practice. We tried talking patiently to three supervisors, but they were teflon automatons who spoke a few pat lines about 'it was our choice' to come to the park. As a family with one under 5 and 3 over 65, we dropped $1000 on the B park we never wanted to go to, with a few hours in the dark at D land. Of course we could have planned months ahead and bought tix online too, but we never thought that a place like this would discriminate against paying customers on the ground over prospective ones online or en route. Greedy. Nasty. The movies are preferable to the place. Never again.",1
"My son wanted to go to disneyland for his birthdsay (Christmas time). Bought three day hoppers for my kids and I. Went in the first day I bought tickets, place was swarmed like never before. We decide to use the fast track passes and one ticket was not working. Asked 4 different workers and they kept sending me to someone else. Went and stood in line for an hour at guest services on a windy day only to be told I had to go to the front entrance and get my ticket scanned. I went to 4 more different entrance booths and they kept sending me to the next one until I got clearly upset then someone scanned it...it was never scanned at park entrance.Now that we wasted a couple of hours walking from the end of the park to the front and stood in line for an hour only for the buck to be passed around, my son started having trouble with his asthma so we left to the hotel.Unfortunately it was super windy and my son's asthma got worse I called Disneyland several times to explain my son's health issue and to see how or what I needed to do to get the other two days refunded since I coulddon't take my son outdoors. All four different times I called every single representative was extremely rude and could care less about my situation. They kept telling me my tickets are not refundable. That is $507.00 extra in two days that we cannot use. They diddon't care. They pointed out that it was stated on the tickets they are not refundable. No one has the opportunity to read your policy on your tickets until they are purchased which is then too late. They pointed out that I had 13 days to use them. we extended out hotel stay a couple more days to see if my son's breathing problems would get better costing me more in lodging, mind you it's Christmas time (not cheap season). I was told  well you can come back withing the 13 days  I told them I lived in San Francisco not exactly around the corner. They stuck to their cold monotone rude voice and kept saying  well they are not refundable  I wasted $795.00 on two hours at Disneyland. We usually go to Disneyland twice a year, they lost my business for good for their greed and lack of empathy.Worst customer service experience I've encountered in a long while. Disneyland is not what it used to be. Its all commercialized. Plus nothing special for Christmas which was the reason why my kids wanted to visit during x mas time.",1
"Disneyland has a disgusting policy of misdirection concerning it's rules on their disability assistance pass. Instead of verifying each visitors individual situation or even handing out a pamphlet on their ruled, they use passive aggressive psycops on the disabled such as: Each customer service rep giving a different interpretation of the policy which intentionally serves to confuse people into giving up. Also in each section the method for acquiring disability passes changes inexplicably. The younger employees usually give in but the older ones are trained con artists using dime store psychology on vulnerable people. SHAME ON DISNEY",1
"My family has been big fans of Disney for a long time. We have vacationed at Walt Disney World in Orlando many times. However I feel that I cannot truly express my deep disappointment in Disneyland strongly enough. I wish I could give them zero stars. I believe this park is a detriment to the Disney Brand. We visited on December 29, 2014. The experience began with horrendous traffic and an infrastructure that was not built to handle the crowd heading to the park. Inside the park it was dangerously overcrowded. I truly feel that there is a safety issue for families with small children. We were seperated from each other more than a couple of times, as it was impossible to stay together in the extremely overcrowded conditions. Fortunately we did not have small children to keep track of. The lines were also unacceptably long, not only for the rides but to use the restroom as well. The wait times for some rides were over two hours. I am glad I was not there with a young child who would have been looking forward to visiting Disney. The disappointment would have been crushing. It made me very sad to see young families trying to make the best of their visit and trying to console crying children. Until this visit I had always believed Disney was all about giving everyone a truly wonderful experience. I guess I was just drinking the Kool Aid. My opinion of this company is very damaged. To anyone thinking of visiting Disneyland I would most strongly recommend that you look into Walt Disney World in Orlando. They still have the magic. However I would avoid Disneyland in California. There is no magic there, only disappointment.",1
"You have to wonder when profit comes before service. We spent two days at the two parks. Yesterday you could barely move in Disneyland. Some queues were 150 min wait and fast passes for most rides were finished by midday. Our family of 5 only went on a few rides and then left in disgust. This morning we got there at opening (8am) in order to make the most of it. Whilst the crowds were a little better, we still diddon't get to do all the rides and left at 5pm. Pretty disappointing when you consider our kids are young teenagers so only a few rides appeal to them. Trying to get the ART back to our hotel was a nightmare. This was the worst of the three theme parks we visited this holiday. We will never return here during holiday time (if at all).",1
"Having just been married and honeymooned in Hawaii, I could think of no better place than Disneyland to take my new bride on our trip back home. Boy was I wrong.... 1. Attractions  severely outdated. Where is the investment?2. Long queues morning, afternoon, and evening? Typically between 1 and 4 or at least after 6 the crowds die down. Not anymore. 3. Hour wait for restaurants at off peak times? 4. Poor poor crowd control. I mean EVERYWHERE IN THE PARK! 5. Fire escapes with massive queues? Forget about it.... 6. Food options  severely poor. Want to eat healthy? Leave the park 7. Massive queues for toilets. Both male and female!Planning woulddon't have helped you! You can plan around crowds regardless of getting fast passes. Crowds everywhere who walk like zombies and you cadon't move. NO SPACE TO WALK OR SIT AND HAVE LUNCH! Really Disney you shoulddon't have let soooooooo many people into a crammed and packed environment. My Wife and I had the worst experience and vowed to never return. This was her first and last. Save your cash and head to Universal Studios instead. They know crowd control. Get a VIP pass while you're at it and save yourself the headaches. DISNEY is oversold and overrated. ",1
"Relentless noise, unending crowds, hours of waiting in line, incessant omnipresent Disney theme music. There are few places on planet earth where $96 a head can be better wasted in such spectacular fashion. If you're a sucker for mickey mouse and can manage to scrape together their ransom, Disney wants you.",1
"We will be visiting Disneyland in December January for my husbands Big Birthday so I wanted to make it special by ordering him a cake to be sent to a restaurant. I called the (non 1 800 number on their website (714) 781 DINE) to order the cake. I spoke to a young guy and right from the get go he seemed dazed and confused about what should have been a simple transaction. It was about a 30 minute conversation to try to order a very simple cake. I had already waited on hold (long distance) for 45 mins to get through only to have more issues with order. He took all of my information including hotel, name, confirmation   AND my credit card information. He said he would then send me a confirmation email. Well I never did receive an email. I waited two weeks and called back. Same problem again, waited on hold for 30 minutes when finally someone picked up. I went through my whole issue with her and she seemed just as confused. She put me on hold about 6 times for minimum 5 6 minutes while she consulted with someone else. Finally she says there is no record of my order but she will follow through and speak to the hotel and bakery etc and call me back that same day. Surprise, NO call back. Who hires these people??? Why do they all seem to be brand new with no training?? Soooooo frustrating. So third time is the charm, NOT. I call back again today to try to track this order. I spoke to Anita today and the first thing she said was that they dodon't place orders for hotel delivery that I have to go through the hotel directly...What?? why diddon't the first two reps tell me this?? Needless to say I have cancelled the order (that diddon't seem to exist) and I will not be doing business with Disney dining anytime soon. I have booked a restaurant from their website but it woulddon't let me make changes to it, I had to call back again (no 1 800 ) to make a simple time change.You would think a company this big would have the best customer service in the world. They dodon't even have a  feedback  link on their website to email. They really need to go in and clean up their website and make it more user friendly (very confusing in some areas). Another simple solution to placing cake orders is to have an online link to do this yourself. Take out the agent all together then there is NO ROOM for error. COME ON DISNEYLAND, catch up with the times and get a website designer to fix these issues. And get a 1 800 number for your customers.",1
"This is a repeat visit to Disney land after many years (years required years of alcohol abuse one year since the previous pain of queuing for hours seared my synapses). LOL10 am Nov 25 2014the first queue: to catch a trolley from the parking lot to the parkthe 2nd queue: to get to the security check pointthe 3rd queue: to buy tickets (no discount for the elderly, only for kids 9 & less)the 4th queue: to enter the turnstilesthe 5th queue: to catch the trainthe 6th queue: to buy lunchthe 7th queue: to take a popular ride (1 hour on a Monday) not counting ride maintenance downtime of 30 minutes for Matterhorn   this was a 2 minute thrill.the 8th queue: to take a second popuar ride also about 30 45 minutes for a 5 minute thrillthe 9th queue: to catch the trainthe 10th queue: to catch the monorailthe 11th queue: to catch the monorail back to the park (there was a parade we missed because the first monorail train was full)the 12th queue: to catch the train at sunsetthe 13th queue: to catch the trolley to the parking lot.That's poor use of people's time, the rides are too short duration for the queue time duration put in, the cost seems rather high, since there were no famous characters visible walking in some sectors of the park at all! The only toons we saw were in the Fantasy Theater show which we jumped a train ride to visit when we heard it would start in 5 minutes, it had vacant seats and NO QUEUE but no close photo opps!!",1
This was my family first trip to Disney Land and it was bad and disappointing to my us. The rides are old and not suitable for teenage kids. Also because there are so few rides are activities for older kids the lines are long. Long lines during the month of November! We arrived at 10:45am and was gone by 12:00pm. It was a wast of money and time.,1
"My Disabled daughter wanted to go to Disney on her 9th birthday, which was yesterday. and so we stood in line to get her Disneyland disability access service pass, I opened my purse to get her pass out and Sarah saw an old pass in my purse from last year which I kept because it had my Daughters Photo on it.after giving sarah the new pass she said (I saw the other pass in your purse and you cadon't keep that!) she said it very harsh and mean, and the affect it had on my daughter's face, really hurt my feeling's.Angela, was dressed like a disney princess, and it was her 9th birthday and she could even sleep the night before for excitement of going to Disney for her birthday, and the first stop we make after arriving in the park was to the chamber of commerce, and a blonde named sarah, hurt's my daughter's feeling's by taking her old photo and throwing it in the trash in front of her.this makes me feel sick to my stomach when I think about it, she then said it was her rules, but I told her that I was upset and diddon't like the way she made my daughter feel about it, she should have cut the photo out for me, but instead she said after throwing my daughter's photo away that it (made her feel better!) she was (happy to ruin my daughter's birthday)this hurt our heart and made the both of us cry.",1
"A while ago I posted that Disneyland discriminates against the physically handicapped by inviting them to pay to rent a wheelchair but will give out disability access passes to the cognitively challenged. NO FAIR. While discussing this with a friend who's child is cognitively challenged, I found out just how egregious this practice truly is. My friend was required to provide the child's medical records in order to receive the pass. That breaks HIPPA laws regarding the right to privacy!",1
"Disneyland has outlived its usefulness. We went there this morning and ended up turning around and going back home. It was 10:00 am Sunday morning. We currently have Premium level annual passports and definitely will not renew them. The hassle of getting there through the thousands of cars, getting shuffled out to park in the boondocks, waiting to get on a shuttle, standing in line once you get to the park to get in, and then standing in line all day for the attractions. Then there is the aggravation and overpricing for the mediocre food. I've had it!",1
"Disneyland is way too crowded. They need to revoke all the millions of annual passes. I went in September and it looked more like a ghetto playground where parents drop their kids off to be babysat. I was so disappointed and have told everyone not to waste their money and go (I live in Oregon). You need to be a GD rocket scientist to manage crowds, wait times, and shows in the evenings. You'd think it was free after spending the day there. It's totally pathetic now. It had been about 10 years since I had last come and I recommend taking your kids to Hawaii for a family vacation. Check out some of the apps and see for yourself how big the crown index is. 100 thousand people in both parks by the afternoon. It's ridiculous!!!",1
"I grew up in Orange County, and Disneyland was a childhood icon of cleanliness, customer service and most of all Magic. I came with my grown kids and grandchildren and my grown daughter and I were shocked and saddened by so many things. The park is dirty and disorganized. The workers worn and wrinkled uniforms represented their tired and sour mood. And the attractions....so very sad. Small World has holes and tears in the ceiling with the insulation coming through!. The displays are dirty and warped in places. Many of the top rides were down, this is not a disappointing as when you finally do get on to one it is dilapidated! It was a sea of people being herded like cattle so you know the income is still there, so the question is what are they doing with the money? They are not using it for upkeep or employee training. I have to say also, I remember a Disneyland that had unique areas to experience different  magic  from around the world, this Disneyland was awash of airport style kiosks selling their tired overpriced wares. My grandchildren saw nothing of  Disneyland  this was a tawdry commercialized mimic or what we knew.",1
Our family has been to Disneyland many times since 1995. We havedon't been for seven years or so and what a disappointment it has become. We coulddon't even enjoy the theme of the park because there were so many people you coulddon't move. It was next to impossible to cross the street. Tower of Terror had only ONE elevator running. Indiana Jones malfunctioned and we sat in the dark for part of it. Disney's emphasis on multiple day tickets has ruined the enjoyment of the park. Is there no safety limit on how many people can be in the park at once? On our way out we heard a woman telling a Disney  castmember  it was  extremely unenjoyable  and he pointed for her to go complain at a certain place. Over $100 a day to ride less than ten rides. Pathetic.,1
"While the long lines at the park are famous, apparently horrible and rude service is a standard at the hotel too.",1
"Disneyland is a nightmare. It's old, outdated and crowded. We lined up 3 times for splash mountain, totalling 3 hours in total. It broke down as we got to the front of the line every single time. Perhaps it's time to retire the ride if not the theme park???I complained, and had to line up to do that. A JOKE. Hated the place, Will never ever go again.",1
"I'm telling you what. This was a major disappointment. Enormous crowds. So thick you cadon't walk anywhere. Kids are hungry by the time you make it from one spot to the next. I never saw Mickey Mouse. My stoller got taken. What you think Disneyland is, and what it really is, are way Differant. It's not for kids. It's a freak show for adults. No kid will like bring hauled around in a crowd all day from one long wait plus 2 minutes of ride to the next. It was cute and Disney has done a fabulous job with entertainment but, the crowds are outrageous. And we came at a  slow  time. Also, just FYI it is  gays days  on Oct 4th at Disney. The crowd consisted of every gay man and women from allll over. It wasdon't anything I'd go to if you paid me and I feel taken that I actually paid to get in this place. Not magical at all. Ps, we did love cars land.",1
"This was an overpriced, run down, horror of a trip. It was the first theme park trip for my twins ever and it was a joke. First off, NEVER go to Disneyland on the day of the Halloween party night. They bussed full price patrons to off park secondary lots to park. It took us 45 minutes to get to the park. They made me break down a stroller with two two year olds in it. Strangers had to help me because the bus driver did nothing. We stood in line three times with out kids for photos with characters and each time, just before we got to them, they walked off and wranglers told us we were out of luck. The rides were boring, our kids could care less. The lockers were closed, the parking was blocked and the place was junky. If you have the choice, go to DisneyWORLD. This park is a shadow of it's former self, overpriced, run down and stuck up.",1
The crowds were ridiculous. Plenty of attractions were closed for maintenance. My wife and I coulddon't wait to get out of there. The food is averaged and typically overpriced.,1
"My husband and I took our son and his two children to Disneyland in April 2014. We are both seniors. Disney offers no senior discount. They charge full price for children 10 years and older. For five of us, 3 adults and 2 children, ages 6 and 11 , the entrance fee for 1 day was almost 500 dollars! This is not the worst of it. The lines for rides were so long that in 8 hours we only rode 3 rides! an average of $33.00 per ride! A few major rides were closed for  renovations.  Closed? Really? During Spring break!? One of the busiest times of the year? Not only were a few of the main attractions closed, but there was not notice of this until you walked a good distance to get to these  closed  rides. Then you discovered they were closed. We also stood in a 45 minute line for the safari boat ride only to be told they had to close the ride temporarily and please come back later! Really Disney, is this any way to run a theme park and maintain your reputation? The saying, I'm going to Disneyland  definitely has a new meaning for me and my family. Our trip to CA from Pennsylvania and Colorado with a visit to Disneyland as a main attraction was a total disappointment. Maybe instead of selling tickets to a countless number of people per day, Disney should limit the number of tickets sold so people could really enjoy the rides and what the park has to offer. Also, give reduced rates if rides are going to be closed for renovations. To spend 45  60 minutes in a line for a ride that takes 3 minutes is a total rip off, particularly when this ratio of time in line to time on ride is the rule, not the exception. Really Disney? Walt would be ashamed!",1
"Too much money, too many people at all times of the year. Having a day where you can get on the rides quickly is like spotting a unicorn; never happens. I get that they do what Disney does better than anybody else, and yes, your kids should experience it at least once ( over a two day period, because you will NEVER get on everything in one day, due to the long lines). My gripe is the every increasing entrance fee, exorbitant prices for mediocre food and the fact that I cadon't get to my car if I want to. Not easily, not on my own. I have to wait for a tram to take me to the hinterlands, whether it's in the structure or an outlying lot. My Disney days are done, my kids are over it too, they prefer Knotts and their next step will be Magic Mountain. ",1
"The cast members in some instances were not friendly, nor was the service on rides, kiosks, or stores what we have become accustomed to at a Disney resort. If Walt Disney were alive and waking around his park, I think he would be alarmingly surprised. The parade and fireworks were wonderful as always. Toontown is in the sun almost all day and the wee ones coulddon't ride anything because of the 100 degree heat. It was a waste of time to even walk over there. The train station on Main Street diddon't have a ramp for strollers to get to the station requiring two people to carry the stroller upstairs. We coulddon't find a handicapped ramp or elevator to get up there. Park hours have been reduced and ticketing prices have gone up, up, and away. Of course, this maximizes their profit and bottom line. We stayed at one of their hotels and the extra hour does no good because only a limited number of rides are open that extra hour. It is almost like they dodon't want you there anymore.",1
"I think I hate everything about this park now. It hasn   t happen all at once, but over many years. It is trite, played, and really nothing of value to see and do anymore. Overpriced kiddie rides. Formulated and sterile, there are no surprises or WOW factor. Food is marginal anywhere in the park. You   d think after 50 years they   d reinvent at least the food and have something good and upscale. Lines, lines, lines, lines and it   s hot, sticky, and unsanitary. For us there   s no Disney magic and I think a time for Disney to turn the page and throw in the towel. Maybe focus on virtual park? People ride in a virtual world online together as a simulator. Just need to add the Smell O Rama device to any PC for urine, greasy cheeseburger and burning oil from the go kart rides. Disney will not get another cent from me and my family.",1
"I visited on August 23, 2014. Half the rides where broken or  temporarily out of service due to mechanical malfunctions . The worst part if you are waiting in line and the ride happens to malfunction you are asked to leave or wait 45 minutes for them to fix the ride. Note the wait time to board the ride is 45 minutes so if it malfunctions you will have to wait another 45 minutes or come back and wait again. The submarine was closed down till fall of 2014. Wait time was approx. 45   60 minutes for a 2 minute ride. I was called sir by an employee who diddon't even bother to correct himself or apologize. Worst experience would rather spend $192 I wasted at another park.",1
"OK, taking on the Mt Everest of theme parks.. we just got back after an August 18, 2014 Monday visit..we drove down from the SF Bay area..Buy a multi day ticket.. BEWARE they now INSIST on taking your picture and demanding that you sign your ticket.. what the heck..??? I said no, the Nazi Disney ticket taker told me if I dont like it go back to the ticket booth and return my ticket.. he then called a manager who was much nicer and tried to tell me that it was for my benefit if I lost my ticket.. right.. So with parking, 2 adults and 4 year old child $300... check.. Pirates of the Caribbean  No warning that Pirates is now pretty scary for 4 year olds..  Dead men tell no tales .a recurring them... (I have been on that ride at least 6 times over the years and dont recall it being as scary..)No Fastpass for Pirates of the Caribbean.. wait 45 minutes ON A MONDAY.. OK it was around 1 PM... check..Fastpass for the Raiders Ride was xlnt.Stand in the early afternoon sun in 90 degree heat with zero shade or misting system for Small World..on a positive the wait was only 30 minutes or people would start dropping.. you mean after all these years no one has figured out that it gets pretty hot in the summer in Anaheim? No shade offered???Wait for the Disneyland train and watch bozos cut in front of you.. not just one.. but at least it had seats and was in the shade..Incredibly crowded.. people all over your butt.. bumping into you.. how crowded??, the parking lots were filled or closed by noon and we were directed to park in an adjoining mall bowling alley parking structure.. there was a shuttle..BEWARE  2.. if you drive they are doing major construction on Interstate 5 within a few miles of the park and you will pay for that in time wasted sitting in heavy traffic.I have enjoyed the park in other years.. but my advice AVOID this place in the summer and wait until they finish that freeway renovation.. Oh even my kid told me he doesnt want to go back again  ever Dad .",1
"on my sons make a wish trip ,we were treated worse at Disney then any other place we visited. we were suppose 2 get vip treatment,instead we were treated very poorly. we arrived early and were told our room was not ready yet,,but would be put on a priority 2 get it ready so we could check in early,and they would call us as soon as it was ready.normal check in time was 3pm ,nobody ever called us .so we went back 2 check in at 4. we wee told our room was ready. at 5 they finally called 2 say our room was ready,that we were already in.When we went 2 the park one of the rides broke down and we were stuck on it 4 over a hour in 90 degree heat,my son started getting sick, so I got him off the ride myself. after getting off we were told 2 get back on till they fixed the ride,I refused 4 my sons safety ,his body does not regulate heat properly, they were mad. I went 2 guest relations 2 complain,they offered us vip seats 2 a play,my son was sick and did not want 2 go 2 it. I asked if they they could do anything else instead like a free meal or a gift card 2 spend in the park, they refused and said there was nothing else they could do.I dodon't belive a multi billon dollar business could not do anything else they just did not care! I will never buy anything Disney related agin.",1
I have been going to Disney for 40 years. This was the worst visit ever. I have never ever seen so many people packed in. I realize it was summertime but I seriously wonder if they were beyond a safe capacity. It was impossible to move. The lines were ridiculously long for everything   even with fast pass. I will never go there again   EVER! I felt the situation was not safe and I am not exaggerating!,1
We went Disney July 23.24th. Prices keep going up food was the worst ever my kids wanted burgers so we went place called Diner. burger cold cheese not melted. i asked if they could melt cheese they said no hahah i had to laugh this is sopposed to be a happy place everybody was grumpy put me bad mood.waited over 2 hrs to go on cars it was broken..went back later broke again.Not worth $ 2.000 trip that what we spend tickets food hotel 2 days.,1
"We had a major concern with ride safety at Disneyland in California which they refused to address. Upon boarding California screaming rollercoaster, the safety restraint system was pushed down and caught my camera bag. The strap on my bag pulled accross my throat and started choking me at which time I started yelling to the ride operators to stop the ride. They clearly heard me but chose not to stop the ride. It was only because people in line started screaming that the ride operator came over and released the restraint system. While I appreciate that things can happen on the rides given the number of people that visit disney, I am disappointed at the response I received when I complained. No one seemed interested in addressing my concern. Disney would not take my name or phone number to follow up on my concern. They will not even provide a phone number to speak with someone regarding any concerns that you may have with the park. While I have enjoyed disney parks in the past we will not be returning based on the way they handled my concern. ",1
"It was the first time that I visited Disneyland as a disabled person. The staff did their best to accomodate my needs. However, there is not enough disabled seating for either Fantasmic or the Fireworks show. I cadon't stand comfortably for more than 10 15 minutes. However The disabled pass worked great for me and my family.",1
"Just visited universal then to Disneyland  what a disappointment. Have boys age 13&14 and it was so lame for them. Disney world is so much better. Not enough f& b outlets  long lines! Rides are old, hokey  no fans or misters on 95F day. Hope California adventure is better tomorrow as I'mOut $450 bucks in tickets already. ",1
I was so exited to go on this trip. I arrived to the park with my 9 year old daughter and this was her birthday gift. She could not wait to get inside. When we got into the park Main Street was all she enjoyed. Every ride we tried to get on broke down. We waited on ALL of the main rides and they all had technical problems. 12 hours at this park and all I did was stand in lines for nothing and watched the parade fireworks. Awefull. Buyers beware. ,1
this was way too expensive and crowded each line was about 3 hours. I don not recommend this whatsoever...,1
"We have just visited Disneyland park in Anaheim (June'24, 2014). The first time we had visited this park was in 2002. So, more than 12 years passed. Nothing changed, only the price skyrocketed. The high price however did not change the park to a better one. No matter what time we go to this park I have the same sad experience of visiting the UNHAPPIEST place in the world. Each time, I give myself a promise to never come back. But, guests come and we have to go there and visit this so called California trademark. The place has so many parking places but not enough space for people. You can easily park your car, however it is impossible to park yourself within the park. People walk around the park as zombies from place to place hoping to get into a ride. However, the wait time to any ride is 90 minutes on average. There is no a single empty place to seat. There is no place to even stand in the shade. You just have to walk in circles with the feeling that you are like a crazy animal in a zoo. Only, it is a zoo for humans for which you pay to be in. I strongly advise all of you reading this comment not to visit this park. Their so called  future world  actually lies somewhere 15 30 years in the past.",1
"We took our 6 year old son to Disneyland (his first time) expecting it to be a magical experience for us all; unfortunately it was anything but magical. We planned and paid for our June trip in January, unaware that June 17 19 was the worst possible time to go. Upon our arrival the first day, we noticed an inordinate number of people...the lines to the rides were 45 minutes to over an hour, although the posted  wait time  was often only 5, 15, or 20 minutes. After the first 2 rides, we asked a Disney  cast member  about the long wait times and seriously large crowd, and she explained to us that this was due to the  day pass  holders trying to get in their last visit(s) before the passes expired...and she added that it would be better for us to come back but not on the 19th because that was  senior day  when all the 2014 grads would be there and it would be even worse. But, we were from out of town and had hotel rooms only through the 19th, so we were stuck. Since we had  fast passes,  we were naively optimistic in thinking that wait times for the 6 rides for which  fast passes  were available would not be an issue since the  fast pass  allows riders to return at an appointed time  with LITTLE or NO wait.  To me, NO waiting means that the riders would pass through the entrance to the ride and walk directly up to the loading area and LITTLE waiting would mean riders would enter and walk up toward the loading area, getting close enough to see people loading and would wait for only a few minutes before being placed on the loading platform or in a seat. Apparently this is not what  fast passes  do. Riders with fast passes approach the entrance to the ride where they may or may not enter immediately...once fast pass riders enter they may walk only a few feet or a few yards, stop and wait... then they eventually make it to the point where they give the fast pass to a Disney  cast member  who will often make them wait before continuing. After this, riders continue toward the loading area where they will again wait before finally loading. Granted, the entire  fast pass  process was faster than what the regular riders endured; however, it was not  LITTLE or NO wait.  We did get lucky on one of our fast passes for Star Tours and waited 14 minutes while the posted wait time was 20 minutes (but it was really close to twice that), but we still waited 70% of the posted time, which I do not consider a  LITTLE  wait. The remainder of our 3 day trip was spent waiting in long lines while watching people cut to join friends and family who had been saving them spots, dodging inconsiderate or inattentive park guests and their stroller wheels as we made our way from ride to ride like salmon swimming upstream, witnessing people enter through exits and then hop the rope railing, and watching rides depart with anywhere from 1 to 4 empty seats time and time again. The one and only time we rode the Matterhorn during our 3 days, we counted enough empty seats in 5 consecutive rides, that an entire ride was wasted. That kind of inefficiency only infuriates people who are trying to wait patiently and enjoy a long awaited vacation in the  magical kingdom . As far as  senior day  goes, it WAS worse. Huge hoards of seniors travelled en masse throughout the park, oftentimes stopping abruptly for no apparent reason and blocking the thoroughfare. They were bay far the worst for line cutting and exit entering. (But we also saw plenty of adults  with their children doing the same.) When we told them not to cut because it wasdon't fair to all of us who had been waiting following the rules, they would either glare, ignore, or roll their eyes at us, call us jerks, or try to intimidate us into backing down by puffing up their chest, planting their feet, and staring. When we brought it to the attention of the Disney  cast members  that all this was going on, we were told that they (Disneyland) were doing all they could do to ensure an enjoyable experience for everyone, but that it was hard to catch offenders in the act because there just wasdon't enough security to monitor every ride, adding they too did not approve of  senior day  because of the unruly graduates and that the only way to change the situation was to make a formal complaint at Disney's City Hall. So that's what we did. While our complaint was acknowledged and filed, we were politely informed that senior day happens every year and the date is posted on the website, but not as far in advance as January when we made our vacation plans. We, as older parents, have visited Disneyland countless times (as children, teens, and adults,) yet we have never once experienced anything as disappointing as we did on this last trip. Luckily our son diddon't know any better since this was his first experience at Disneyland; however he did remark that during our 6 days at Lagoon in Salt Lake City the wait time for rides was basically nonexistent in comparison. We will return to Disneyland, but we will make sure it is well before day passes expire, California schools are out for the summer, and seniors get their  special day  at the park.",1
"I brought my (3) kids (8,6,4) to Disneyland over spring break in late March 2014. I hated it. The kids hated it. The lines were 75  minutes per each ride (we rode 4 rides in 2 days). It was TOO crowded. Disney needs to limit the amount of people they let in each day. Kids and parents will not wait in lines that long. I am a well traveled mom and I did not see (1) happy parent and I saw a lot of people. It was not fun. Also if you have (3) kids under 14 here is the rule:(2) kids under the age of 14 cannot ride together on ANY RIDE.So 1 rode the rides with my 4 year old son. My 2 daughters could not ride together, so I had to ask strangers in line (who were older then 14) to ride with my daughters. It was awful!!! I will NEVER go to Disneyland again and my kids never want to go back.",1
"We planned our magical disney vacation with our 3 grandchildren 8,6, and 3 years 9 months ago. We chose to go the beginning of May as spring break was over, school still in session and we wanted less crowds. We were giddy with excitement when that time came but alas, it was not to be. Upon entering the park a small sign informed us that 7 of the attractions would not be working during the three days we were there, 5 of them were major! They had to get them in ship shape condition for the summer crowds...really, 7 rides at once? We paid just as much as someone visiting in the summer but received far less. Probably the worst thing was the  Magic Morning . We anticipated no lines for one hour before the park opened to the general public. Well, everyone else had magic morning passes too it seemed and to our horror, all early morning customers were funneled into Fantasy Land as the rest of the park was closed. The crowds were crushing! We stood in line 40 minutes for Peter Pan, but when it was almost our turn they suddenly shut the ride down due to technical difficulties! Our  magic morning  turned into a  miserable morning . We then went to adventure land and waited for 15 minutes for them to open the gates so we could be first in line to ride Big Thunder Mountain, then we dashed over only to find it was closed due to technical difficulties! This went on and on all day long and we only rode 5 rides and we were there from 8:30 am till 8:00 at night! The whole day was a joke, so disappointing. We expected the joy and magic we felt as children, and when we took our own young children. I cadon't believe Disney treated us as they did, we felt scammed and ripped off and next time we want to bond and enjoy our grandchildren in a magical place we will rent a beach house. We never want to go back!",1
"Visited 21 5 2014. This park is a joke, three main rides were closed in one park and one in the other and two broken which means the huge crowds made for 2 hour wait times. At $150 for a one day hopper this turned out to be an expensive crowded walk. Google Disneyland to see what a shameful joke this place is, oh...$17 to park a car. I have been to Disney Florida for 29 years so I am not naive about wait times, this park is a disgrace.",1
"I have no doubt that Disneyland was going off, circa 1982. But it has not kept pace with the times and it is just sad, dingy, shabby and rundown. And a total waste of money.I had a few laughs, but at one point the big rides (the ones for adults) ALL shut down except for space mountain with no indication when they'd reopen, plus a bunch like pirates of the Caribbean and finding nemo were closed all day. It was quite bizarre.What they need is wifi access, more signage in general, electronic signage letting you know what is open, ride wait times etc   all the things that people these days expect.But more importantly it was just the overall dinginess that was the biggest disappointment  happiest place on earth and magical is just a marketing ploy   an excellent one they do brilliantly. The reality is just old, dated rides that looked shabby and 80s. Even the staff in their awful uniforms looked like someone from the 80s trying to look 50s.Unless you have young kids, and I mean age ten tops, dodon't bother. It is just sad and overrated. Totally shocked at the good reviews this place gets. I think it just is one of those childhood fantasy places we all build up in our minds, and the reality is just awful.Save your money and go elsewhere!",1
"My husband and I, and our 24 year old daughter, spent a fortune for the two day park hopper. Yes, it had been 16 years since we had last visited,  the happiest place on earth,  but we did not expect how awful our experience would be. First, when I bought the tickets as part of staying at the Disneyland Hotel, the person on the phone should have told me that Friday, May 16th, was Grad Night. Thousands and thousands of unescorted 17 and 18 years olds filling every possible space on the entire property   misbehaving as only 17 and 17 year olds know how to misbehave. IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY THAT WE WORKED VERY HARD TO MAKE. Second, the park was filthy and the rides have not been cleaned in a long time. For example, the bar you would automatically hold during the ride on the Matahorn was so disgustingly dirty, we had no interest in holding the bard. Not surprisingly, we heard various people complaining as we exited the ride. Also, the bruises I got because I was not able to hold on were certainly not worth the experience. Third, it is so clear that Disney only cares about making money. Several of the rides were closed and others had a 90 MINUTE WAIT. Nonetheless, they have no limit to the number of people they allow into the park so at times, you can barely breath because of the number of people around you. Fourth, many of the so called  cast members  are clearly unhappy with their jobs. I dodon't blame them, actually, when there are thousands and thousands of people running from ride to ride desperate to get a least a little bang for their buck. I could go on and on, but I wodon't. I highly encourage each and every one reading this that they spend their money elsewhere. I also suggest that Disney management spend the day at the park with someone like me. It wodon't be me because I do not have the resources to waste another $550. Walt Disney would be rolling over in his grave if he knew how poorly treated the  guests  are at the park. And for what? To make a buck. Shame on you Disney. Shame on you.",1
"If you are going to Disneyland stay away from grad night . The park was at capacity and the grads were very rude of guests who paid full admission for the day into the park as well. Line jumping , yelling , drinking in line . It was out of control. Would not recommend this park in the week of may that has the grad night . We wasted 100.00 each for this day into the park .",1
"Any other business that lost half of its product would of closed, but not Disneyland! They shut down finding Nemo, Indiana jones, its a small world, Alice in wonder land, pirates of the Caribbean, grizzly run and the little mermaid rides and charged full price. Fastpass was a wait of 4 hours after you got a ticket on the few open rides and all the lame rides had long lines because half the park was closed! It was horrible, and more rides broke threw out the day! They would post 30 minute wait times and then let field trips and any overweight person on a raskel scooter cut to the front of the line making wait times 2x as long as posted! They closed half the rides and had every school in California schedule a field trip to make up for off season money losses! Mickey mouse is a thief..",1
"My husband and I just recently took our kids to Disneyland. We've been there in the past but my youngest boy haddon't. We'd planned this entire trip just to take him because he brought it to our attention that he'd never gone and he is 11. We have gone many times before and been very pleased but definitely NOT this time!! What a WASTE OF MONEY!! I'd read on recent reviews that the park had gone down hill but coulddon't believe it because after all, this is  Disneyland! . I wish I would have listened. EVERY single one of the big rides were broken down except magic mountain and several rides broke while we were in line and had waited a long time. They claimed they are all under  safety maintenance  but ALL AT THE SAME TIME??? It was extremely disappointing and an expensive trip to get there and not be able to show our son how fun Disneyland can be. It appears it's under new ownership and they aredon't putting money back into the park. They've also bumped up things you can purchase which made us feel like all they really care about now is how much money they can make in a day off you. I'm sorry but they dodon't have water mist things in the park like Magic mountain or many shade areas but our main complaint is that everything fun such as  Indiana Jones, BigThunder mountain train, It's a small world, Pirates of the Carribean, Matterhorn, you name it  OUT OF ORDER  and I heard it had been this way for a MONTH!! Yet they are still charging people the full amount and not telling us when we book our tickets online. WE FEEL VERY RIPPED OFF both money wise AND our son's first and probably LAST Disney trip.",1
"I have not been to Disneyland Resort for about 3 years. It was AWFUL. Several of the adult rides were not open during the early morning hour. They closed rides regularly, and they did not have them staffed to run both sides (only half the ride would be open) so the crowds were as bad as the summer months. I am a die hard disney fan and was so disappointed. I will not return to Disneyland Resort.",1
"Our experience began on a day that the park should have been empty.With so many rides down (piriats of the Caribbean, its a small world, finding nemo, Indiana Jones just to name a few), crowds every where, long waits, and the smell of dirty diapers, we will never go agian. At $368 $16 for parking for the family, I should have a guided tour by mickey himself. We payed $208 for 6 flags, and $178 for Knotts, a lot better deal as we got most of our rides, without crowds.",1
"Lots of rides were shut down due to renovations and the rides that were open kept closing due to technical problems. For example, I went to ride Splash Mountain and was in line 4 times before it was working long enough to get on finally. Way to many people for so many things to be going wrong. :( ",1
"We spent $1200 on tickets and paid for plane tickets from Washington and Oregon to get to So. California, then paid $400 to rent a van for the week. What a disappointment and money wasted! The park was so crowded we could hardly move. We were there 5 1 2 hours and only got on four rides! There was a two hour wait for FastPass tickets! Five of the most popular rides were closed or broken down, and there was no one working on them. Why would they do maintenance on all of these rides at the same time during Spring Break anyway? We will never go to Disneyland again!",1
Magic mornings dodon't mean anything anymore. You get in a hour early to find out that you only get half the park and out of those rides they didnt have the big rides open like space mountain. Most of the rides are out dated unlike universal. I brought 4 kids ages from 5 to 10 that all liked universal studios better than Disneyland . Will never come here again.,1
"Where to start... ok.. we arrived to where the Disneyland at 9 on the dot. The park opens at 9. and the parking lot for the park was closed.. not full.. just closed, so it took us 40 minutes to move up 1 block to turn around. Only to be forced to park at Downtown Disney then have to walk all the way to the park  no shuttle.. nothing. Then we had to wait in line to have a tiny purse that can only hold a camera checked for what seemed like half a day. Eventually made it in the park a bit past 11am. We go inside the park.. only to find out a bunch of the rides are closed! When we asked for directions or where the restroom was.. EVERY employee in the park had an attitude. I asked where I could find a map for the park and was told  outside . The bathrooms are so so so so old and dirty. There was zero control over the lines as well. People kept cutting the lines for EVERY ride!! It was crazy! I've been to many amusement parks and several times to Disneyworld and have NEVER had this issue! Also, there were no park photographers anywhere. At Disneyworld, they're everywhere! In Disneyland, we found 1. Ride operators.. super rude as well. The whole experience was pretty much ruined from the start. Not magical at all. I will 100% NEVER be going back again. I love Disneyworld Orlando and will be sticking to that in the future. OH.. and the food WAS. SO. NASTY. SO SO SO NASTY!!",1
"The way they run this is a joke! I took my kids here to get pictures with the princess so we stood in line for our turn. As we where waiting patiently for our turn about 20 little girls dressed like there favorite princess cut in the front of the line. I asked the employee, AKA Cast Member why was they aloud to cut in the line like that, and he said girls dressed like princesses get to go threw the line to have there pictures with the princesses first. How is that fare??? Is this what Disneyland has came to, is letting people cut in line and it's ok, they promote that! Wow!!! So They dress like the theme of the attraction and it's ok to take cuts, so I guess if I want to cut in line for the Haunted Mansion all I have to do is dress like a ghost, or Space Mountain dress like an Astronaut, or a cowboy for Big Thunder Mountain ect., and that's totally ok??? We will never stand in the line for Princess Fantasy Faire again!!!",1
"It was crowded. The only reason we went in was to see the Frozen Queen and Princess. It happened to be the most popular attraction. In the morning, they said they had 4 hour wait times   we went in the afternoon and the lady at the line acted like she was doing us a favor telling us it was just over 2 hours. I diddon't mind waiting the 2 hours while my husband and toddler played, but some of the guest service folks were irritable and terse. In defense of Disney, we are not Disney fanatics. It's just not our dream vacation. We could have taken our entire family to hike the rainforest in Costa Rica for less money and woulddon't have to wait in line. We gave it a try and it was about as expected. We enjoyed the Character Breakfasts much more. ",1
"Hi everyone my family and I went to disneyland california for Christmas...this was my children's Christmas present this year.....The happiest place on earth right?...Not for us......we went on Christmas weekend.....my daughter is 10 and my son is 7...this is all they wanted from Santa this year is to go there... so we planned our trip...we planned our trip through Disneyland and stayed at a neighbor resort   .... or trip was miserable.              For it to take all of our savings and extra financing just to go there..... and to drive 23 hours      ...it was horrible my kids were very sad...     .it was so busy we could not ride any rides...people were running in to us knocking my daughter over.....we could not see any of the shows or parades people were crowded everywhere... workers were very rude about standing were you could try to see...i guess it was a reserved spot, ....go figure........ just a heads up dont go durring a holiday they ruined our Christmas. .... I will never go again durring a holiday!!!!!! I also notified the   customer relations desk   of the   problems we were having they said next time dont plan durring a holiday .....well I kind of figured that much...they were no help at all....I rate this theme park very low... wish my family could have had fun for christmas...like all the commercials...it is supposed to be the happiest place on earth.. well not for us my kids they were very sad.....lines were like 3 to 4 hours long....we even paid extra for the park hopper tickets both parks were the same.....I guess that a theme park that large wont care about losing business for a family of 4 when they have so much business already..... I think thats wrong.. I have also notified the resort and no response. ..so I thought I would give everyone a heads up and tell our experience with the parks....",1
"This experience was terrible. The park is in disrepair, rides breaking down continuously.There are an unacceptable number of rides that are closed fro repairs also. There is no reason for this to happen when you are paying close to 100 per day just to enter the park.Restaurants are awful, prices are disgusting, customer service is non existent.You really get a chance to see all of the people who have 5 kids they cadon't afford when you attend this park, very low end clientelle. Would never return.",1
"This 1 hour of Magic if you are staying in the Disneyland Hotel should be called 1 hour of disapointment. You only get half the park...not the entire park ! Only some of the rides in the open section were operating. Once the entire park opened...it was packed...people EVERY WHERE...LINES for every thing ! This is no longer my kind of relaxing destination. If you are tired of being over charged...tired of crowds, and in need of a vacation...dodon't come here. ",1
"Absolutely Terrible! Dodon't waste your money, they need to have some cap on the number of visitors allowed in on any particular day. The day we went there were so many people you could not move.We had to stand in queues to get on rides for over an hour for a 10 min ride. After standing for 4 hours for a couple of rides we had had enough and left in disgust.The food was expensive and terrible and you also had to wait first to get served and the wait for a table to sit at.DOdon't BOTHER!!",1
"This is the third time in 6 months and I was not impressed. This time there were a lot of rides out of order. The monorail was always down when we tried to take it back to the Disneyland hotel. The Finding Nemo ride was down until Spring. It's a Small World was also not working during our week there. Alice and Wonderland went down and Splash Mountain went down while in line. For $250  a ticket these rides should be working. Now for the worst part it was my sons birthday and all he wanted was to see his friends, the characters. Daisy one of his favorites refused to sign his autograph book. She pointed to her wrist as if to say no time. We waited in line for 20  minutes to get a picture and an autograph and she had the nerve to turn down a two year old. I believe Mr. Disney would be upset by what a money hungry company this has turned into. What about the Happiest Place on Earth? Please do yourselves a favor and rethink using your money on Disneyland.",1
"Although we had a great time celebrating my baby granddaughter's 1st birthday on Sunday, January 26, most of us developed the Norovirus this week and were very sick. The baby was the first two days later to start the vomiting, fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Next, her mom and grandmother got it two more days later. We had lunch at Caf   Orleans and the baby had the apples and carrot sticks (something else with that menu item, maybe pasta). Anyway, we would like to see the resort do a better job of food safety. I had to go to Urgent Care yesterday to rehydrate with an IV. This is the virus that has affected several cruise ship passengers recently. When I called Disneyland to inform them of the incident, the operator put me through to Guest Experience and no one picked up the call. I will be calling the Health Department also.",1
"It was so over crowded that the dream did turn into a nightmare! one could not stand stil    keep mooving!  any staff member would shout! no kindness, no magic whatsoever! I would never ever go back on new years eve again. It was disrespectfull to people that pay a lot of money for the tickets, travel great distances and find themselves treated like cattle... or worse.",1
"What a terrible day! We were there from 10am to 8pm and managed to get on 3 rides! The queues were ridiculously long   the wait time for the Indiana Jones ride at 10.30am was 2 hours! The free pass system is a joke. We used it to bypass the queue for Indiana Jones and were given a time between 1pm and 2pm to return to ride. We coulddon't then use the free pass again until half of that time had elapsed, so we coulddon't prebook other rides until 11.30am! We eventually gave up in Adventureland, and went to the Star Wars ride which was top of my list. The actual wait time was 3.5 hours. When we tried the free pass, we were given a return time of 11pm that night! How utterly ridiculous! We eventually decided we would not allow Disney's greed to ruin our day   we would enjoy ourselves but without getting into anything which is what we did. We believe it is sheer greed to allow so many people in on one day. The queses were so long that they impeded access into other areas of the park. Queues for toilets, for food, even to buy a bottle of water at a vastly overpriced $3.00! We were chatting to a local who sympathized with us, saying that if she had paid full price for a ticket, paid flights and accommodation and then had to spend the day with a park full of grumpy, frustrated people, she'd also be highly peeved. NO ONE was having a great day out, that's for sure. I understand that the parks are busier during school holidays, but there is no excuse for what we experienced on 2 January. Very very disappointed. Thank heavens we diddon't have small children with us.",1
"Have been going to Florida for thirty years for Disney World. I was raised on the best customer service, the friendliest people, the cleanest parks, the open spaces....then we decided to mix it up and come to California for the first time. I know it's the left coast, gang infested, a billion in debt, but I'm going to see Disneyland! What could go wrong? Man... The good? Well the Matterhorn macaroons were amazing! Fried green tomato sandwich was great.The bad? HORRIBLE customer service. They were at best, indifferent to guests. Very few people were friendly. I could go on and on, but just know this....if you have been to Disney World, skip Disneyland. I wish someone had warned me. YOU, HAVE BEEN WARNED! Haha... ",1
"We arrive 12 31   1 3 in the park. At one point on New Year's Eve, the crowds were so great one literally could not move. The employees were moving people like cattle, roping off areas, yelling at guests. I needed to stop on a side line to catch my breath while figuring out how to simply leave the park to go back to the hotel (I coulddon't handle the crowds anymore) and was screamed at by a Disney employee that I coulddon't stop walking and was literally ordered to walk a direction opposite the main gate exit. I asked him to please escort me out to which he told me I continue in the opposite direction of the gate. In a word: pandemonium. Will I go back? Likely, yes but like in March or some off the wall month like that. Take my advice dodon't go at all during the Christmas or New Years holidays. Dodon't do it. You'll thank me! Learn from our mistake. ",1
We have been Disney supporters for many years. But each year they go up an incredible amount of money for their annual passes and Dailey ones too. Then you get there and every line is at least a 30 min wait and most are 45 or more. If you ride a really popular ride 11 2 to 2 hours. For the amount they charge to get in its really not worth it to only be able to ride 8 10 rides in a 12 hour period. I would suggest to lower the number of people let into the park to make it more bearable but Disney is far too greedy and might miss out on a few hundred thousand coke sales,1
"Being born and raised in Southern California, I have been going to Disneyland my whole life. I am only writing this review and giving it one star because they need to get their act together and start selling only a certain number of tickets per day. The price of the ticket keeps going up every year and so do the crowds. So in the long run they are charging MORE for less because there is no way you are going to get a true Disneyland experience when you can barely move around the park! It turns it into a stressful, Hellish experience and the complete opposite of what Disney's reputation is supposed to uphold. This is also unfair for families who travel really far, from other countries, who spend thousands just to take their kids to Disneyland and then cadon't even enjoy what they paid for. It's unfortunate because DIsneyland is so popular, crowds will continue to pay the full price no matter what. And Disney knows this. It is so irritating. It is not as big of a deal for me who lives in Southern CA because the park is so close and we get Southern CA resident deals, but I would recommend people who are visiting from far away to avoid Major Holidays and try to visit on the off season to get a full Disneyland experience. I love Disneyland but have little desire to go back because overcrowding ruins it.",1
"My wife and I visited Disneyland on December 30th. The visit was more than a disappointment: it was traumatic. The reason is that Disneyland management does not regulate the number of visitors in the park. During our visit the park was so over crowded that the atmosphere was frightening. We entered around 11AM and by 1 the major rides had wait times exceeding 100 minutes. The problem isdon't that Disneyland is poorly managed: it is the opposite. We encountered employees knocking themselves out to be helpful, the major rides were all working and the food was good. Of course, when we ordered a meal in one of the park's sit down restaurants we coulddon't find a table. We actually put our tray on top of a trash can and ate on a bench in the sun. The women's restrooms had 10 15 minute lines and just getting from one ride to another was a frightening experience. There were so many pinched and unhappy faces in the crowd and many sobbing children. Our kids were actually ready to leave early: they were so disappointed. In the end we paid over $350 (plus parking and food) to ride two theme rides and the Tom Sawyer canoes. All of this could have been prevented by the Disney corporation thinking hard about park over crowding. Reading across the internet after coming home, there are websites and apps that provide info about crowds: the Disney corporation should tell you about wait times for rides and or projected attendance before you fork over your hard earned money. Disneyland has in the past been closed by order of the Fire Marshall. Management should have closed it yesterday. I have grown up in Southern California and have been going to Disneyland since 1962. Yesterday was the last time for me. Walt Disney founded the park to give families a magic experience and that magic is destroyed when the park is over crowded. The current management needs to take on over crowding or watch the reputation that took generations to build wither. What a loss and what a shame: it doesdon't have to be this way at the formerly magic kingdom.",1
"Disneyland should be better than it is   very disappointed with our visit, which for us was a once in a lifetime event. Its not everyday you travel from Australia to go to Disneyland! The crowds were unbelievable   people, people everywhere, huge queues at every ride. I have never seen such a huge concentration of prams and wheelchairs in one place before. The parades performances were great, what we could see   people take up pole position 1 2 hrs before the event. Staff were average, looked bored and apathetic, its definitely not a magical place. My suggestion is that numbers entering the park should be capped to ensure that people have an enjoyable time . Of course this woulddon't happen because I get the feeling that it is all about money at the expense of people's enjoyment.",1
If you enjoy spending $92.00 a day to wait in very long lines you will have a great time.  the passholders have over run the parks and filled them to capacity daily.,1
"If it was possible to rate them a zero I would have. While I realise that Disneyland and Disney   s California Adventure are two separate parks they much of what I have to say applies to both parks. There is not enough information out their about either park for first time visitors. They cram to many people into to smaller space and charge way to much for it. It seems that the only way that Disneyland is value for money is if you live in California, pay monthly for an annual pass and spend most of your free time there. For staff that are responsible for moving a lot of people all the time, their crowd control is terrible. It seems to me that they have given responsibility to people who are to young and inexperienced, resulting in people who are on a power trip telling people what to do and where to go that is not conducive to getting anyone anywhere in a timely and efficient manner. The scheduling of things within the parks also seems to be an issue. For instance there is no way you can see both Fantasmic! and Fireworks at the Disneyland Resort, and have good views for both, due to the times they are scheduled for. Yes I accept you can see the fireworks from just about anywhere near the parks, if you want to see the Fantasmic! by the water then see the fireworks in front of the castle it is pretty much impossible. And forget trying to catch something in the other park. And for those of you saying go to parks on different days or get multiple day passes, what about those who can not afford the extra days or who do not have the time to spend in Anaheim as it is stop over on their trip somewhere else. Two big issues Firstly, lazy people on motor scooters that they hired at the park. I am by no means tiny. My BMI would put me into obese at the very least and I was repulsed by the number of lazy people driving round on these. Who seemed to be spry and agile to get into the lines and onto the rides but could not walk between them. I was in the park from 9:00 am until midnight I was by the end of it, I could have kept standing if I had to. The longest time I stopped and rested was the half an hour I spent sitting on the sidewalk along with thousands of others watching the parade at Disneyland. If you can   t walk the whole time don   t go. I have no problem with those who brought their own scooter because they needed it, but scooters should not be an option for laziness. Secondly, parents with children far to big and old in a stroller. Once a child is a certain age it should work (baring any medical conditions that require assistance). One women had an eight year old in a stroller. That is far too old!! And again these strollers are hired at the park. Fair enough have stroller hire for those who have travelled some distance to get their and weren   t able to bring the stroller for their little one but should they really be readily available to all and sundry who can squeeze their 8, 9 or 10 year old into one. Then they have massive areas filled up with stroller parking. One of which was prime viewing location for Fantasmic!The only thing I absolutely wanted to get at Disneyland was a picture with Mickey. I found a Mickey out and about, got in the line and then was told the line was closed come back later as Mickey has other things to do. Would that have been their response if I was child!Fast Pass, line time estimates, the phone app and line cutting.All very very annoying and all mean we line up for even longer. The day I was there the glamour rides all had three hour wait times and many had no fast pass. The estimated line times were not even close to being correct. For example on the board in California adventure it said 30 minutes, at the ride it said 45 minutes, the wait was over an hour. The phone app may be useful for those who live in California (shocking) and are therefore not paying roaming charges and who can check the waits before even leaving home. There was no way I could have used this app I would have spent a fortune on data charges to find out I had to line up forever. And then there are the people who put one person in the line, who texts everyone else when they get close to the front, who then push their way through the line, essentially cutting in. And you get people who wait for the shows hours before the start again saving space for lots of other people. Shame if there are only two of you and you only have limited time in the parks so one person can   t sit in a prime viewing spot all day saving space. High points (I did manage to have a couple):I did have one lucky break at Disneyland and it was purely by accident. I happened to be walking passed the entrance to Splash mountain just as they were reopening it. The possibly only helpful staff member we struck all day said to go now as know one was in the line. Walk straight onto the ride, which was fun and got soaked. Don   t think I would have been quiet so impressed if I had to wait three hours to ride though.I would say to anyone who does go, don   t rule out the non glamour rides. I loved the mad hatters tea cups and could have rode them all day. Lets just say if I ever go back to Disneyland it will be way way too soon!",1
Workers were rude. Coulddon't really do anything without buying fast passes. Disabled people (usually fat people which is not a disability) are allowed to cut the lines. Will never go to the Disneyland resort again.,1
"4 major attractions were closed. We were stuck in a roped off line when they closed the 4th attraction the Haunted Mansion after a line not moving for 30 minutes. Finally patrons got upset and just took the ropes down themselves. Due to the 4 major rides closed, crowds got nasty. So bad workers started yelling at the crowd instructions but it was just chaos. Then all kinds of jumping lines by teens. The crowds were so bad that many times handicapped and strollers coulddon't get through. If anything had happened it would have been a disaster. Worse how they handled the closed rides of Frontierland train, It's a small world and the Haunted Mansion was awful. They should advise you when you arrive on closures. When traveling we checked the internet but only the Frontierland Train was closed on the site. No refund. No fun. Orlando is so many times better, safer and well run. This park should have started moving to a new location 30 years ago. We will never go back. It just wasdon't worth waiting in line or having 3 fast passes for the day and no ability to go on anything worthwhile for adults between then. 92 dollars for this and expensive food. Really? I'll fast pass out of here.",1
"Way too crowded, way too expensive, way overpriced.  I dodon't get it... you stand shoulder to shoulder lining up for a few short, old, cheesy rides.  After three hours we left.",1
"Well, it's what is it is. It's expensive, incredibly crowded, so very tiring. You spend most of your day in lines and your legs and back will hurt. The kids are cranky, the parents are annoyed....FUN! The food is awful. The only positive thing I would say is that everyone working there was very nice and accommodating.",1
"terrible terrible do not waste your money,,long line ups very long you will be exhausted and tired and not even worth ,,additional to that its not made for kids to have fun its made for parents to spend money ,,,between every game you will fine 3 shops at least to spend your money its made for business just marketing to make you spend you money ..went to other fun places but never seen in my life a place for marketing like this...my big advice save your money,,, in every 5 kid you might see one kid happy the rest either want to buy stuff which their parents do not want to spoil them or kids tired and want to go home,,its a torture for parents......",1
"I dodon't understand all this great reactions. I come from Belgium and I thought that visiting Disneyland during our trip through California would be a good idea. So I bought 3 tickets (276 dollar) online and went there the 19th august 2013. The crowd was huge but this we expected. What bothered me the most, was that two of the major attractions were off that week (they should mention this on their website or at least give a discount if they would be honest). We took a fastpass for the splash mountain but it wasdon't working when we arrived. We returned after an hour and finally got on it. But while being in the attraction, it broke down and they had to evacuate us. Consolation price : a fast pass for another attraction...Because of this, the fast pass lines elsewhere became long as well (min. 30 min of waiting). So for me, it was a big waste of money and I dodon't understand the people who enjoyed this particular park.",1
"I visit california to stay with family every 18 months and usually visit with around a dozen of our US family for a day out. We spent christmas 2010 there and were very disappointed that some of the rides were out of action, the fireworks were cancelled and that the crowds were so big I had trouble getting into some of the other rides. My father in law is in a wheelchair and on some of the rides we were allowed to the front so he could get on the ride, only to be sworn at by some people standing in line, this in front of the disney staff who did nothing. Also we were shouted at by Disney staff when trying to get through a crowd with the wheelchair for going the wrong way. I e mailed on my return to uk and was offered free entry for my family when i visited again. I tried to speak to Disney this year during my visit and they did not want to honour their previous offer. Thanks Disney. Poor old Walt must be sinning in his grave at the way the company has gone. High prices, $92 for a day pass, old tired rides and attractions, No discount for California residents ( who keep the park going) rude unhelpful staff, extortionate food prices. Save yourself the money and trouble and give it a miss.",1
"Arrived at Disneyland very excited because my children finally reached the age where they can remember the Disney parks and it was very disappointing. First thing we saw on Main St was Minnie for autographing, so we approached the line and people with no manners were cutting in front us, mainly the parents for their children, so I had to remember not all people have manners, including adults. When we got to the front Minnie just grabbed the autograph book from my daughters without even acknowledging them, diddon't really have time for a picture and I looked at my daughters and said  I know not what you expected , unfortunately now they are at the age where they will remember this experience when they see the Disney characters. It was 1030 am and the first thing I thought was isdon't it too early for Minnie to be rude already? Either she is being overworked or they aredon't paying her enough to act like this. Disney staff need to ensure they have  Happy employees  because they have people like me who forked at least $3000 for a wonderful experience at the park, I dodon't think Disney is broke yet to underpay their employees or settle for less. Saw another incident where Goofy pushed some children to get out of the way like you are done, I understand children dodon't comprehend their time is up, but cadon't they get someone hire staff to move people in a nice manner. Diddon't remember anything like this at Disney World parks, they were all very nice courteous staff but unfortunately my children were 3 and 4 and dodon't really remember. So my word of advice is save your money for Disney World, I will never pay for Disneyland again!",1
"I took my family to Disneyland Resorts in California and sadly it was lacking in most categories. Specifically, the majority of the employees, mostly on the California Adventure side, were terrible. They lacked any semblance of manners and were condescending when asked for information, especially if you had any sort of a disability. However, there were a few employees who seemed to enjoy their jobs and went beyond what a normal person would expect to assist you or just to ask how things were going. On one particular incident, my daughter was busy vomiting up, in public, her clam chowder bread bowl she had just finished eating from the bakery in California Adventure Land. The employees and the  Lead  cook of the bakery were totally uncaring and condescending when out of nowhere one of the busboys stopped and assisted us. He seemed genuinely concerned about her welfare, kept repeatedly asking if we wanted him to get someone other then the employees of the eatery to help us, asked if he could get her some water, medical assistance, etc ... go figure, the lowest of the lowest paid is going out of his way to accomplish the goals and vision of Walt Disney, where the supervisors and the managers were failing miserably.On the bright side, most of the rides were in working order and they were clean. The employees working on the rides on the Disney side were very helpful and cheerful, however on the California Adventure side it was totally opposite. 90% of the ride operators were either rude or uncaring and virtually all were unfriendly. However, again, there were a few employees who stood out with their friendliness, mostly because they took the time to approach us and ask us if we needed help or just to start a conversation with us.Overall, I would would recommend the Disney side to others. However, the California Adventure side failed miserably. I would not recommend it to anyone, especially if you have any sort of disability.",1
"The buildings from cartoons I liked. The terrible waiting time to get on a ride. My kids waited 1 hour in line to get on a 90 seconds ride. The broken rides you expected to ride and they were broken, that I diddon't like. Crowds were terrible there ought to be a limit how many people are allowed in.",1
"We have just got back from our holiday in the US. We have been to Disney many times across the global network. This holiday was in California so we were at the Anaheim location. The crowds and resulting queues and waiting time made this visit unbearable for me. It was only that my child would have been disappointed otherwise I would have packed up and left. Not only are the waiting times unreasonable the number of breakdowns (or in the language of the staff there  maintenance work ) was unprecedented, we stood in line in some cases for 80 minutes to be told that the ride was out for maintenance. There was no offer of a FastPass or other acknowledgement of the time waisted in a line to nowhere. Unfortunately I think Disney are living on an historical legacy but if they are not carful, they will start to loose what is a special brand. I will not be back anytime soon.",1
"Visited Disneyland July 14 16th 2013. Cost of two day park hopper for just my wife and I $420.00. With this was our hotel accommodations, expensive Disney food, we total out at $800.00. Even if everything went perfect this still is way too expensive. But we experience Disney during a two day period that included five attraction breakdowns and heard from others of two more. We approached an attraction that posted a 30 minute stand by time, an hour and 15 minutes later we were told that the ride was experiencing technical difficulties and that we could leave and come back later. Huh, fat chance! This was typical for our other experiencesNot only is Disneyland food expensive it borderline edible. We have decided to forgo anymore Disney corp. vacations and seek other  more bang for the buck' options. Our advice when you are considering a Disney vacation, Dodon't!",1
"My first and last trip to Disneyland. My family and I are Walt Disney World travelers 10 years plus staying there at their best locations (Contemporary, Grand Floridian, Wilderness Lodge and the Polynesian) over the past 10 years. We never experienced anything negative at Walt Disney World. We expected the same for Disneyland. We found the parks to be dirty, cast members to be rude, crowds in the park, not really family oriented and scary looking, tons of tattoos and piercing everywhere. We asked Disneyland's help when we encountered a drug deal going on at our Disneyland approved property and was hung up on and told off. This was just not one person. We ran into about 7 cast members who were rude not just on the phone but also in the parks. Not really the happiest place on Earth. They are very unhelpful, and if you are handicap, their new attractions were made handicap accessible for people only with mobility problems only. If you have a handicap person who is unable to wait on long lines, due to other medical issues, too bad! your handicap medical pass gets you no where! Their only solution is for your parties to separate and call you when they are ready to go in. In addition, we were threatened on one of their Disney approved properties and they upgraded to a dump   took pictures to prove it. Just all around rude people and not worth traveling west for. My advice is go to Walt Disney World if you are able. The workers are nicer, family friendly, cleaner and the resorts are top rated. ",1
"I have always been a Die hard Disney Fan for many years, and I do think it is good value family entertainment due to the expensive cost for entryBut Sadly there is something about their park prices over 9s Adult You must be joking rip off 5 of my family and no change from 500 dollars ??? Add food and trinkets 800 dollars during recession Is way over the top for a very old park ,The best example is space mountain so old about to fall apart that is why it is taking so long for them to get the ride up and runningI am not saying this to scare anyone but big ticket price is going on keeping this old lady going,There is just no great men like Walt Disney left the dreams are ending its time to build better rides Universal is now better value and updating rides with new ,",1
"I planned a trip to southern california around disney and it happened to be the place we liked the least. I had the most miserable, tiring, hot day of my life. I went on a weekday to try and avoid the crowds somewhat. But 1.5  hour waits for the big rides. 45 minute waits for the kiddie rides. Lines to eat. Lines to go to the bathroom. I expected lines. But we barely did anything all day. We used the fastpasses as much we could. But standing in line all day in full sun when it is 100  degrees drove me nuts. Disney, please can you please get some more benches in the park. But what topped it all off was when i stood in line for about 1 hour we were the next group to ride, they told us they had to shut the ride down for the parade. So we waited in line for nothing. Also, when my fastpass time for star trek ride came, the ride was stopped for maitanence because it had problems. Terrible terrible park. I am sure i just had bad luck and the hot did not help. But it was insane and i will necer want to come back.",1
Was there for my grandson's 5th birthday and there is no way I will ever go back. $15 parking was the first price gouging and from then it was downhill. $ 90 for a young child; 30 minute or more for one of the lesser rides; overpriced junk food. The kids seemed to have a good time so we stuck it out to the bitter end. I dodon't see how a family of six could spend much less than $1000 for the day. I can think of many better ways to entertain young children.,1
"We have always lived in Arizona but.....have been annual passport holders since 1992. Sadly, we will not be renewing them this year.....Disneyland is not what it used to be and hasdon't been for quite some time.I used to worship their management philosophy, even attending the Disney Institute in Orlando, but that was the first thing to go. You can now listen to, quite frequently, cast members gossiping about each other, cursing, being rude to and completely ignoring guests. They have resorted to selling nothing but complete junk in their stores, the food now resembles nursing home food...it goes on and on and is really sad!Granted, the park is breathtaking at Christmas, it's not enough anymore.Example: you've waited in line for 90 minutes for a ride...you've just sat down on the ride, the ride breaks down. Old school: you'd get a 1 time pass for you and everyone in your party, to any ride in the park without waiting in line, at all. Now, they just instruct you to exit to the right.I could go on and on but I wodon't, it's too sad.",1
"We went to the park when school was still on to try and avoid crowds... we were unsuccessful. There were so many people you had to walk at the speed of the rest of the crowd. Some rides had over a 2 hour line, including many of the food outlets. We queued twice for the Indiana Jones ride, got almost to the front of the queue and then were sent away due to technical difficulties. I woulddon't recommend this to anyone but die hard disney fans that would really appreciate the shows.",1
"Not sure if it was because we went on a Friday, but the park was so busy it was difficult to walk through some parts. All of the rides had ridiculous queues, and even with the fast passes needed to come back 3 4 hours later. We queued up twice for the Indiana jones ride, and both times got to the front and the ride broke down. Wasted 3.5 hours of our day for nothing. No sympathy or reimbursement from the staff either. Rides were all quite average, would highly recommend next door (California adventure park) for much faster, more efficient queues and more modern rides!",1
"Is it just me. or am I pointing out what a lot of families are seeing? It seems like Disney management is pricing Disneyland admission out of reach for most families. Family discount tickets are almost impossible to find and even then are greatly overpriced. I dodon't think Walt would approve (or brother Roy either). Their pricing policy seems to be based on sheer greed. What is the most money we can suck out out of the budget of a family of four for a three day admission? (Presently about $950). When did the Happiest Place on Earth become the Greediest Place on Earth? Well, I just recently noticed that their share price is hitting record highs so somebody must be happy.",1
"I went to Disneyland about 30 and 25 years ago and thought it the most wonderful place. For the first 3 days of May i took my wife and 10 year old daughter and hoped to re live the time I had previously and show them what it was like. While disneyland itself has not changed and California Adventure is also great the number of people allowed to enter make it impossible to enjoy. What was a wonderful place is now just a profit center and i am sorry but allowing that many people in and having long lines has ruined this place for me. The management need to only sell tickets for the number of people that the areas can accomadate and keep lines to a maximum of 10 minutes. My memories will be of children crying and people fainting standing in queues that are rediculus, and this was in an off season period.",1
"I visited Disneyland 15 years ago and had the best time however, when I visited again in Nov 2012 it was somewhat overcrowded. Throughout the whole park we got to go on only 3 rides. We stood in line for over an hour to get into the haunted house, got to go on the teacups and on the Merry go round!!!! That was it, the lines were just ridiculous! There were that many people there they had Pram parking and I can tell you now I have never seen so many prams in my life!!! We paid around $380 for me and my husband to go to Disneyland for one day and California Land for the next day including parking.....I can tell you now for that amount of money I would never do it again! It was a total rip off. We saw Disneyland but that was about it! Not worth the money.",1
"There are very few places on earth that I intentionally avoid.  The waits are endless.  Everything is over priced.  Half of the kids are overwhelmed, cranky and acting like brats.  Who needs that?",1
"Was very over crowded, in fact, it seemed to be more crowded than Christmas. It was not as enjoyable as it once was. The line ups for rides was as mush as 3 hours.",1
"My son and daughter in law treated me to a day at Disneyland and Calif. Adventure for my birthday.I haddon't been then for over 20 years. I felt like someone from the past transported to the future.It was so different than the Disneyland.I could not believe how crowded and over booked the parks were.We were only able to go on a few rides and two of the major rides had technical problems and they diddon't know when or if (it was near closing time) they could start back up.They never offered any sort of compensation or discounts for having spent over an hour waiting.Walt Disney designed the park according to very strict guidelines.I did my senior thesis at UCLA about Disneyland and I know Walt Disney would be horrified to know that because all they want to do is make money, they no longer care if you get on the rides or not.They have so many shops and food now that is all you can do because you cadon't get on the rides.I really enjoyed being with my family because all we did was have time together while waiting in lines.My husband e mailed Disneyland and of course they diddon't care or offer any compensation.The California Adventure is nicely designed.",1
"so crowded, people were rude and crossing in front, no manners way to crowded, coulddon't move without being ran over or running someone over.",1
"That's basically what we did: we paid to stand in line. We paid to be among crowds of people. We paid (too much) to eat carnival type food.This is more of a warning than a criticism of the park as many people love Disneyland and are undeterred, apparently.If you dodon't mind long lines, throngs of people and mediocre food, then this is the place for you.I diddon't see any of the Disney Magic. I tried. I tried to be patient and have a positive attitude. But it just diddon't make sense to me to pay that much to wait, to be in crowds, and eat bad food.",1
"I have annual membership of this park for past 12 years now. We go there coz my daughter and wife love it. My best moment in this park is when we in car and start to drive back home. Here is why...1. 80% time is spend in waiting for rides or walking past the crowd.2. They have terrible terrible food quality. Although in past many years they have added many new restaurant types, but the food is just atrocious in taste. It it unhealthy and tasteless.3. Everything is overpriced.4. They are probably best in mass people movement to keep crowd in control, but it is ridiculous that it takes 60 minutes from the moment you part car to get inside the park entrance.Kids love it... but it does not mean they deserve 5stars.",1
Sure the rides are fine and the people on duty are ok. My complaint is with the Disney Standards in this park??? Since when is it ok for an ice cream vendor on Main Street to hold up one finger and shoosh me while she finishes her conversation on her CELL PHONE??? WHAT??? Since when is it acceptable for employees to walk across the park in costume carrying backpacks while looking down while texting while they are walking THROUGH THE PARK? Since when is it ok to have multiple piercings and designer sunglasses while on duty in the park?Man I have to tell you that there is a MAJOR difference between the appearance of the employees in California and the ones in Orlando. WOW! CALIFORNIA isnt Disney Headquarters just a few miles to the North?? GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!,1
"Why cadon't you put lower than one star? We picked a Mon Ties Wed in August to try avoid crowds. How wrong we were. well the crowds were not bad, the manners of the crowds were bad. Awaiting the Maaterhorn we waited for hours while people in front of us let freinds and family into the line. we questioned a  cast memeber' and was told  what do you want us to do?  after over a 2 hour wait, we passed the sign that said 90 minute wait, We exited. The same thing happened on many rides. WE purchased a special picnic to asure us a good place to watch Worl of Color. Temp over 100 degress with no where to sit. 5 minutes before show they let in 100s of people in our special area. We had a good place to watch until 100s got in front of us. Same thing happened at fireworks sitting on hot pavement and then cast memebers tell us we could sit on ground. So we stood for 50 minutes. We had made a reservation for Carthey Circle Resturant, we arrived 10 minuts early and were told there would be a hour and 1 2 wait. Why take reservations? WE got fast passes for Cars at 8am, the fast pass was for 4pm. We got in line and still had to wait hours as we were told they wanted to clear up single line. When I arrived home I wrote a letter to Guest Relations, they wrote back, to say it was a corprate form letter would be a understatment. Asking why we didnt go to guest realtions in Town Sqaure, get out of line to complain about the long line and people allowing friends to enter Asked why we didnt talk to cast meember, I told them in letter I spoke to many cast members and NONE were very helpful. THen they had the nerve ( i think they were being funny) to give up front of line passes for rides, but they were not good on Matterhorn or Cars, the 2 rides I complained about. I guess they thougth they were being funny. They gave me the regualr BS about no refund, i reminded them that because something said no refund there are expections. If a non refubdable ticket on a plane is canceled they give you your money back, if you have opera tickets and it is cancaled you get your money back. I dodon't believe that they even read my letter, just did the old  send him excuse  5 letter . They should be ashamed of them selfs calling it Guest Relations. I will never go back and tell everyone how bad we wer treated by Disneyland. It is so clear Disneyland wants one thing  Your Money  once they have it they have no interest in helping anyone, WE spent over 700 dollars for 3 day passes. The Happest Place on Earth, they shoud be sued for false advirtising!",1
"Our family of 4, including one free child, paid $250 to get in to do what? we got to see 5 features rides since we spent all the time in line ups and this is February!! To the see Tinkerbell was over an hour wait, waited 45 minutesbut never got to see Mickey as we were told we had to wait at least another 45 minutes to see it. For a place so busy, it was hard to find food, we had to walk over 20 minutes to find something, as compared to San Diego Zoo or Seaworld. $250 is a lot of money to spend to be in line ups all day and obviously Disney does not have to give a damn as the place was crowded and we were told even more crowded in the summer months. So bottom line is if people are willing to thro wgood money at bad, then Disnet will continue to rape you!",1
"We were VERY disappointed with our trip to Disneyland this time: the new multi day ticket picture taking process that was just launched this winter is leading to unbelievable lines just to get in, tired and rude staff and patrons and a significant reduction of our time in the park (20 40 mins a day   more when we park hopped   lost to lines just to get into the parks). While we appreciate the need to stop people from selling sharing their multi day tickets, the staff at the gates need to find a better, more friendly way to manage the lines and to get people through the process and into the park. We lost a lot of time each day to the confusion and poor people management at the gates. For example, on Saturday, two monorail trains left in the morning empty as the staff at the Downtown Disney Monorail gates were unable to process tickets, take photos and answer the multitude of questions raised. The line just stopped moving. I have never experienced anything like it at a Disney Park and we go multiple times each year.We hope that they fix this quickly.",1
"Although Disneyland is favored by people from all over the world, however I'm pretty upset, and I'm sure I'm not the only one, on the admission prices just to get into the park itself, 75 , that just does not seem reasonable for those who have more than two children...I still love  It's a small world  and the many attractions they have to offer, but the prices of this  Magical  place leads me to believe that the average  Joe  and his family are not welcomed, and it's only for those who can afford such an exspence...If this is suppose to be an American past time then why cadon't everyone enjoy it without having to sell children, tv's, and valuable items just for the price of a ticket?",1
"corn dogs are 6.19, souvenire cups are 12.99. The people working at Disneyland seem to be very unhappy people that dodon't like children.  Their short with you and the food is more like carnival food",1
"lines were long, crowded walkways, and some rides diddon't work. I actually kicked a baby stroller and made the baby cry because the couple were hurrying to their destination. It was an accident but I really felt bad, my daughter got run over by a old lady in a electric cart, and my other daughter had her foot ran over with No apology by the old man. ",1
"Extremely overcrowded. The wait for most rides was between 90 to 120 minutes! Main Street was cordoned off for parades and other events, so everyone had to use the sidewalks only. It was shoulder to shoulder crowded and everyone was being directed on where to walk by the cast members, who were all wonderful under the circumstances. We were even directed to walk behind the Main Street buildings (this was a first for us). I paid for my Park Hopper tickets ($125 each) in advance online. It's very disappointing that management would allow so many people into the park, creating such overcrowding that my daughter and I had a terrible time. At 3:00 p.m., we got our first Fast Pass tickets, for Star Tours, which gave us a return time of 12:50 a.m.! We coulddon't get Fast Pass tickets for another two hours! Even going through the Fast Pass line for the Haunted Mansion, we stood in line for 35 minutes. For the Star Tours Fast Pass, at 1:00 a.m., we stood in line outside in 45 degree weather, for 40 minutes. Patio heaters would have been helpful.The lines for food were very long. After purchasing our food, we could not find seating inside, so had to try to find a table outside. It was cold that day, so by the time a table was available, our hot food was now cold. And, of course, the food was expensive! No patio heaters outdoors, either.The lines were just as long at the California Adventures Park. We've been to Disneyland quite a few times before, but this was the worst time we ever had there. This was not a happy time and my daughter and I have no desire to return. I left with the feeling that Disney was only interested in money, not providing a fun and happy time.",1
We paid $261 for our family of 3 to get in & it was so crowded we road 2 rides. We were there from 10am 10pm. Over 2 hr wait for every ride. I will never go again,1
Disney was max out. No room to move what so ever.Only got in a few rides in over 12 hours. Lineups were 1.5 to 2 hours for rides. Not worth my $$$ I spent to get in.Xmas holidays and over selling tickets are to blame. Shame on Disney for thinking of the money first. Not the happiest place on earth anymore.,1
"For Christmas I surprised my 12 year old nephew with a trip to Disneyland. We drove from Las Vegas on Dec 26, planned to go to the park on the 27th and leave on the 28th. When we arrived in Anaheim on the 27th (about 11:30am) the place was CHAOS. We got routed and re routed several times to find parking. After about 2 hours we finally were lead to a garage behind the convention center. We paid our $15 and entered the garage. Up and up we went ever looking for a space. We got to the top, did a complete circle only to find there were NO SPACES! It took over 45 minutes to get out of the garage as they were still letting people in. We finally were directed to a supplemental lot near the boom lifts. From there we walked back to the shuttle location only to be told (by a disney employee) that the wait was about 30 minutes or that we could take the 10 minute walk to Disneyland. We opted to walk. While frustrated, we were determined not to be angry so we made a pact to have a positive outlook and started our walking journey. What they said would take 10 minutes was really about 25 minutes and quite a far distance.When we arrived at the entrance it was more CHAOS. We chose a queue line and started to wait for tickets. We noticed that the line to our right was shorter so we moved. An employee at the side of the queue line told us  oh by the way, Disneyland is closed as it is at Max capacity. But you can go to CA Adventures . When I explained we werent really interested in the other park she turned away and ignored us   guess she figured she didnt need to speak with us any further. We left the line and spoke with another disney employee who told us that maybe at 5pm they would re open the park after the parade. We then overheard two other employees talking about the issues and uncertainty of the opening plus the fact that Friday would be even worse than today. i can not express how frustrated and angry I was but was trying to remain positive as i wanted the nephew to have a great day!I requested to speak with a Lead. When I explained our crappy day to him, he could have cared less. He gave me a long winded speech on safety and the fire marshall. His suggestion was for me to buy FULL PRICE tickets and wait til they opened the park at 5pm or so. No accomodation or suggestions on how he could make our experience better. WHAT THE H**L HAPPENED TO THE FAMED DISNEY GUEST SERVICE???? Disney used to be the standard for guest service that others wanted to emulate. NOT ANY MORE. Guess they had so many guests that they didnt need my money or my business. Their wish is granted.I asked my nephew what he wanted to do   his answer was to leave and never return. I agreed.Next day we went to Knotts Berry Farm and had a GREAT time. Things Disney should have done1. warned or informed guests of peak days on their website2. had the employees at the parking garage tell us that Disneyland was at capacity and only the secondary CA Adventures was open (Had we known this we would have left sooner and not been as unhappy)3. Taught their staff guest service4. Offered us some type of discount or accomodation to make up for the problems5. Anything other than a lecture on safety At this point I dont ever want to return to Disneyland. My disappointment with them and their lack of service is immense. I can truthfully say that there was nothing happy about our visit to their facility.",1
"I'm in a wheelchair and the place was so busy it made it impossible to move around to get to the attractions. After the first half hour , I wanted to leave. The majority of rides were inaccessible. The park was an unfortunate waste of money. What a disappointment for this disneyland experience. We left early allowing our grandchildren to enjoy their day as we had been slowing them down drastically.",1
"Just an overcowded amusement park for kids. If you are going there as an adult, then find somewhere else to visit. It's not worth going there.",1
fastpass is a con. You can only check in yup one ride at a time. We checked in after lunch.... Told to come back st 1130pm. No kidding.  All around mistake to be avoided.... St least today.,1
"We spent 5 hours here and got on two rides in carsland. Too busy! Also we bought ice lollys from a stall and they got stuck to our tounges lips!!! They were stored in dry ice. I have huge ulcers on my lips now. Thankfully my 3 year old was not hurt like me. I complained and all they did was give me a gift card with the value of the lollys, so i had to spend it back in the park. Such a con. I wouldnt buy tickets to queue for 2 and a half hrs for one ride which they also said the queue time was 90 mins, an hour less than it actually was. Knottsberry farm is a much better day out. You are paying for the brand at disney, your child would get more joy watching a cars dvd!!!",1
"Hi everyone,I come here from Australia just to go to Disneyland this year.It was really terrible, 70 mins  per ride waiting time. Food is expensive, no chairs to sit on to watch fireworks, but supply chairs in smoking areas. $250 for the two of us to enter Disney land, way too expensive to stand in a line.Got told the fireworks start at 8pm so I got a good standing up spot, but then the worker told me it was at 9:30 . So, instead of waiting around for 1 1 2 hrs, I got on the train. But half way round, they announced they are stopping at the last platform and will not be returning back to the fireworks stop until after the fireworks. What a joke. I tried to walk all the way back to where I was originally standing but the workers were directing traffic in one way. I was so upset I just gave up and returned back to the car and left. I will not recommend this park to anyone, I will be ringing to complain.Last year, I went to Knottsberry farm, I loved it, much much better rides, shorter lines, much more cheaper to enter. Disneyland is way over rated.On top of everything else at Disney land, I only saw a few dressed up characters, what happened to Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Goofy etc.I dodon't believe the amount I paid, matched what I got.Very disappointed.Shan Australia.",1
"Indiana Jones, It's a Small World, and others were closed   I was really upset   I wanted to show my kids It's a Small World... The Carousel had spider webs all over it and had not been cleaned or painted it's Horrible!!!Mr. Toad's Wild Ride Broke   problem solved 45 minutes later!Also Pirates of the Caribean broke   while we were on it. For over an hour and we were not allowed to get off  NO REFUND   WHAT A RIP OFF   Total lack of respect for the customers and the dollars we bring. I am NEVER going to DISNEY AGAIN.Almost half our day was waiting to get off the rides. Totally fed up. WORST AMUSEMENT PARK in the WORLD!!! With the Billions of Dollars Disney makes, you think someone could pay for maintenance and fixing rides while the park is closed   NOT DURING THE DAY with passengers on the ride   AVOID at all costs and go elsewhere!!!",1
"We have a kid who is 40  tall. He had to be measured THREE times EVERY SINGLE time we wanted to go on a ride. He had to be measured before getting into line, in the midddle of the wait and then again before being allowed on the ride. He's 2.5 and did not want to cooperate being measured over and over and over again!!! And, we waited over an hour for a ride, he passed the initial two measures, and the last guy threw us off AFTER WAITING FOR AN HOUR saying he wasdon't tall enough???? He had gone on over a dozen rides already with the same height requirement!! The lines are waaaaaay too long and the employees dodon't want to be there. The fast past thing means that you wait while everyone is ALLOWED to cut in front of you. BAD idea!! Never, ever returning!!!",1
"We never saw them, but the chaos is complete at this place. To queue for 80 min to drive Cars for 7 min is completely unacceptable! The amount of people in this park eating around the hole day is too much! We came here at 9 am, did both parks but queued most of the day before we got fed up and left at 5! Never again!",1
"We stayed at the Disneyland hotel which was great with a beautiful remodel and bought tickets to the Halloween party on Oct 3rd. Pros: Nice hotel with a wonderful staff.Excellent food.Nice poolsCons:Very long lines for most popular rides (even in October)Too many broken rides, worst of all being the Grizzly River Run where my 9 year old daughter had to be evacuated off the mountain. It took over an hour and we missed our shuttle and almost missed our plane! I spoke to workers who said,  Yeah, that ride breaks all the time, by October the rides have had alot of abuse and break alot?  WHAT??????? This was close to a $5000 vacation for a family of 3!They handed my daughter a pass to ride again that was only good for the same day. WHAT??????Guest services was no help at all and said the ride was only broken for 20 minutes! What a lie!Diddon't expect this from Walt Disney Corp.!Halloween party:Oversold! It was dark, no one knew where to go, what to do, you coulddon't see the so called map. There were so many people that you coulddon't walk around or get candy or go on rides or anything! $54 dollars a person and I think my daughter got on one ride and got a handfull of candy. We tried to see the parade and the fireworks, but unless you sat in front of the castle for the entire event to save a place, you weredon't going to get a seat. We diddon't even see the fireworks. It was that crowded!!!!!Shame on you, Disney Marketing!My daughter was frightened by the ride experience and really disappointed. She got on the plane ride home crying. I dodon't think we will be going back and we have been big Disney supporters for years. Sorry, but that's what happened.",1
"I moved out west 5 years ago, from the east coast. Having been to disneyworld 15 timewithout ever having a problem I decided to book a stay at disneyland. I was suprisedby the big differences between parks.The bath rooms were very dirty,the fast pass mashineswere being stocked by 8 am and running out by 9 am, the grounds were dirty, I would neverrecommened disneyland to anyone, save a little more go to disneyworld, its larger,cleanerand more attentive. our trip was off peak, Id hate to see what peak time is like",1
"Over crowded, over priced, over hyped. Never again! Hours long wait for rides. Expensive, ordinary food.",1
"I purchased two annual passes online. All info was correct. Order diddon't process. Tried again. Then tried next day. It kept saying transaction could not be processed. Talked online to chat representative named Amy. She looked up the order but it 'diddon't process'. She said just to show up. So my time online both days was wasted cutting into vacation time. Then i found out my debit card was charged for all my attempts   8 times $174! I called and spoke to customer service who neither offered free passes when asked or a complimentary upgrade on the season passes. instead he said to drive an hour and a half to the box office who  might  be able to give free passes. I have no money left on card to purchase anything, and now am down $3192 and they say I have to wait 2 3 days for the charges to drop off. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, the guy transferred me to a 'survey hotline' which then hung up on me.So I could not buy passes, the debit card was charged, the disneyland website was not working correctly despite all info being exact (checked and double checked) and then customer service diddon't do ANYTHING to help alleviate the stress, or to offer compensation for two wasted days of vacation and no possibility of visiting the park.Complete disappointment.",1
"We visited Disneyland on August 18th and 19th, 2012. I was shocked by how rude so many of the Disney  Cast  were during our visit. We got in line for the new  Cars  ride and waited for 45 minutes before the ride was shut down temporarily and were told to leave the line (along with everyone else).We then went over to Toy Story and waited in that line at least 35 minutes before it shut down. They announced that everyone should leave the line. I was hot, tired and had just wasted more time waiting for a ride with my family so I approached the Disney person standing at the front of the ride shouting that people need to leave the line. I asked about being given a fast pass since we had been waiting. She very rudely told me that only people that had reached a certain point in line would get a fast pass and then ignored me. I asked an employee standing in front of the Tiki House what time the next show started. He replied  8:30pm . When I asked him if he knew what the current time was he said no and walked off.Lots of Disney employees shouting at people to  Move out of the way!  etc. No  Please , no  Thank You . If we approached an employee about directions to a ride or about anything else we were treated as though we were bothering the employee.It was like Disney had been taken over by Walmart employees that hate their jobs. It was COMPLETELY different then our experience at Walt Disney World where every employee we came into contact with played their role as a  Happy Disney Cast Member  to perfection.The people checking tickets at the main gate are pretty rude as well. It was very weird but perhaps that's typical for Disney in California?",1
over crowded half the rides didnt work or broke down while in que over priced i never go to this park again!!!!,1
"This theme park was over crowded,then you have to wait for a ride like about an hour then they came with the excuse that the ride broke down , and it wasdon't only one ride it happens to five rides they came with the same excuse,the food was so expensive all over the area including the harbor street,the T shirts forget it too expensive too,then the FAST PASS they make you wait for about three hours for the next ride and still you have to wait in line.this was my third time and my last I go there.then we went to Universal Studios,and sea world,that was great,no problem waiting too long in line,the ride were working alright.That i love it the BEST AND THE BEST. About Disneyland I GIVE THEM A BIG ZERO!!!!!!! ( 0 ).bye",1
"I took my 2 grandkids to Disneyland on a Saturday. Spent 125 a piece to get a 1 day park hopper ticket. It was so crowded that we only got on maybe 6 rides all day. I would say the average wait was 60 to 90 minutes per ride, and even for the small kid rides, they were at least 40 minutes. We waited in one line for 20 minutes and did not move 1 inch. The food was exorbitant as well, spending 9.99 for a hamburger and fries. Next time I will go during the week or around Christmas when it is not too crowded. It was so crowded we did not have any fun at all. We wanted to rent an electriic cart for my handicapped husband and it was 70 dollars. We spent 35 dollars at other amusement Parks. I think Walt would be turning overi in his grave if he knew!",1
After going to Disneyland for so many years it has all come down to GREED. Walt would never have stood for the prices they are now charging to get in the park or the cost of food or pins or t shirts. The Quality of the food vs Cost is just plain GREED. I have been in the park about 45 times in the last 57 years. I have 23 grand children and we will not be coming again. It is a shame that GREED took over the park. The cost of everything has just took the magic out of DISNEYLAND for this large family. We will look to other attractions where we can get a better value. Sorry you have done so much damage to a great place. $$$$$$$$$ GREED GREED GREED$$$$$$$$$$.,1
"We went with my two young daughters and stood in line for 2 hours to meet the  princesss . We finally get in, only to have the princesses  on break  for the show so we got the fairy godmothers instead. My daughters were SO disappointed. When Cinderella came back to her little cove, right behind us, and my daughter turned back to get a picture with her, she got chewed out by the line employee because she had to keep moving forward. We ignored her so she went to whisper in Cinderella's ear, who then turned and walked away from my daughter! My kiddo was in tears. I am still boiling over at the thought of it! Rude, disrepectful. It ruined our whole day. This is supposed to be  the happiest place , well all they did was make my 5 year old cry. Shame on them!",1
"Way too expensive to get in. The park, which used to be kept up, was dirty. Papers and things all over the place. Tried to find a hot dog vender. No more. They want you to go inside one of their expensive places to eat. Security was not to be found. Walt is turning over in his grave.",1
"The kids love this place, but is it possible to have almost all rides fail (after people have stood in line for hours...) on the same day? In the middle of high, high season? And no compensation??",1
"I give it 1 star for being clean and having nice employees, but thats where it stops. There has to be a limit on how many people they let in a day. The lines were soooo long, yes the fast pass works, but you have wait around until you can use and by the time you get back in 2 3 hours you can miss it. If there are parades or shows going on the roads will be blocked off. After 2 months of planning and even more of saving $$ to go and the kids were very disappointed. There are only so many times you can get stepped on, coughed on, run over by strollers,cut off, elbowed, sneezed on, bumped into, kicked and so on. We wish we would have just spent the week on the beach. It was a nice idea, but it really sucked.",1
"I just returned from my visit to Disneyland, I took my grandsons to the park they were visiting from Europe. I am disabled therefore I was able to get a pass in Disneyland to go to a shorter ride, in their new park, California Adventure they were  wheelchair  friendly therefore we waited and waited and waited to get to our rides. I was given a paper with a stamp on it and dated which I was questioned by the Disneyland side 4 times and told that the paper was useless. We had an early pass for one hour early in either park according to Disney employees but we found out it wasdon't for Cal. Adventure, which we got up @ 5:am to go. They did let us in early (45min) to Disneyland but the 2 rides we wanted to ride were not yet opened.The reason I am writing this is for people who are going in the middle of the summer who dodon't have unlimited cash or credit to put them behind for years Disneyland has turned into a class park. Those with little money get very little rides or enjoyment, those with more money get more rides and those with alot of money get more etc. until the very rich see all with little trouble.I feel Walt Disney wanted all to have their dreams come true, at least in Disneyland and that is just not possible in the busy times at Disney. If I ever return it certainly wodon't be at the peak times or maybe I will win the lottery and can spend the big bucks.",1
"I bought four one day one park tickets, paid over $87 each for them, received a receipt but no e tickets.I have emailed them several times, but they do not respond. Clearly this is fraudulent. Now I will have to ask my credit card company to follow up and refund my money.My advice is to go through Expedia or buy them at the gate.Badly burnt and not happy",1
"Do NOT go to Disneyland Wed Sat nights from mid May to Mid June. It is a nightmare of unruly, unsupervised HIgh School students that completely take over the park! It will make you experience NOT a good one. There are mobs of them everywhere. Disney changed their policy, and now allow them unchaperoned to come in during regualar hours for a MONTH! It's such a shame the Dinsey decided to budget cut once again on this!",1
"Disneyland is so overpriced, I cannot believe how many families fork over almost $100 per person for admission. My first trip to Disneyland was in December, 1962. The price of admission was $3.25. You got a book of tickets labeled A, B, C, D, E. Most people in today's world dodon't know what an  E  ticket ride is. Really too bad. There has to be better places to spend your money.",1
"I really dodon't want to be writing a review like this about Disney but I feel like I should share our excperience just in case there is someone out there that is on the fence about which Disney to go to. I'm not going to say dodon't go because everyone should do Disney at least once! Yes everything is over priced and yes you'll run into rude tourist and yes your kids will have at least one melt down over the days it takes to do all there is to do but everyone should experience it once! We have gone to DisneyWorld and loved it! Everything about it seemed magical and even as adults it was easy to get caught up in the magic that is Disney! To bad Disneyland is missing the magic! The first castmember we even saw was extremly rude and that was in the parking lot! No smiles, no how can I help you's just grumpy! Ok so that was just the parking lot and I'm thinking I'm sure once we were in the magic that is Disney would take over...no such luck! Inside the park is dirty and filled to the brim with rude cast members and tourist! Everyone, including the workers were rushing people through. The rides seem tired and in need of updating. My girls ages 7 and 2 were so ready to go before the day was even over. The fantasmic show scared them and since the fireworks start as soon as the first show is over we missed the majority of them. We bought a 3 day park hopper pass and my kids diddon't even want to go back and we spent the rest of the time at California Adventure! I wished we had just went to Florida. We just thought it would be fun to switch it up...turned out we spent more money going to California and missed the fun!",1
"Disneyland used to be  the happiest place on Earth,  but after having been a resident in Southern California my entire life and owning an annual passport to Disneyland for several years, I have seen first hand the decline of this once wonderful place to visit. There has always been a distinct difference between Disneyland and other theme parks in the area such as Six Flags Magic Mountain and Knott's Berry Farm. Disneyland has always been, to me, family friendly, a nice crowd of people, clean, homey, etc. In recent years though, the park has become less than satisfactory. The park's popularity and obvious growth of the population over the past 20 years in So Cal has greatly affected the quality of this once wonderful vacation spot. Despite the cost of tickets and annual passes, which have increased immensely, the crowd does not seem to dissipate. The crowd has truly increased with the prices making a visit to Disneyland unbearable, especially on the weekend. Until the park manages the amount of people allowed into the park on a given day, I will not be renewing my Premium Annual passport (now approximately $500 annually) and neither will the rest of my family. I will be writing a letter to Disneyland to suggest that they manage the amount of people allowed into the park at a time. There should be a system in place, perhaps some type of reservation system that allows visitors to call in advance and book their trip. If someone decides to go to Disneyland last minute, they can still call in and book a trip if there are available spots. This system could also mimic the fast pass system currently in place in the theme park. Not only is a trip to Disneyland these days unpleasant, but for a park catering to parents and their children, a family park, the amount of people make the park extremely dangerous. I could only imagine if there were some type of natural disaster in the park, children, elderly and handicapped would all be trampled with the amount of people around. I will be using my pass up until it expires and will probably not be visiting until something changes with this once magical place. I wish everyone could have experienced it the way I did as a child.P.S. The food at Disneyland and in Downtown Disney is awful and definitely not worth the price. The only place that is decent is Catal and Club 33!",1
"I have been a loyal premium Disneyland annual pass holder for most of my life. In that past couple of years my family, and I have noticed a notable increase in the amount of people attending Disneyland. This past Sunday marked the end of our pass holder status. I went with several members of my family, including my two toddler boys. The park was so crowded it took us four hours to walk to Toon Town, go on Buzz Lightyear, and leave. Aside from our extreme level of frustration, my bigger concern is my sons' safety. Had there been any sort of problem my boys would have been in jeopardy. To give you an example of the crowd, I was at Disneyland on the 50th anniversary, arguably one of the most crowded days in the park's history, and this random Sunday was worse. I find it hard to believe that the park had not far exceeded maximum capacity, but I guess when I get on an elevator, and look at the elevator's maximum capacity of people it too seems ridiculous. Disneyland is no longer a fun and safe place for me to bring my kids. Between the drive, parking, getting through the crowds, its stressful and dangerous. There are so many other wonderful places to take them in the area, and I'll spend that $2000 year I was spending on annual passes, there.",1
Just a far cry from Disney World Fla.  Not as clean   a cheap version of Disney World.,1
the lines were long and the rides kept breaking and they closed rides without posting any information elsewhere in the park.    Loved Sea World the next day!,1
"We went in March, on a Wed, and the local school districts should not have had Spring Break, so we figured it would be crowded but not so much that it coulddon't be enjoyed. We were wrong. Luckily we were at the gates at 8:00am, and for about 2 hours, were able to enjoy the place. We hit a few big rides like Finding Nemo and Pirates of the Caribbean. They were nice I guess, but not great, something you'd wait 10 minutes to see, but not much more. Then by maybe 11am the place began to swell with people. And I mean SWELL, from comfortable walking around to jammed packed, stroller to stroller, bumping into people constantly because the aisles simply could not accommodate the ratio of people to walking space.We began thiinking  what the heck? How could this many people be paying the $300 we paid to get into this place, here on this day in March?  And my husband quickly figured it out. The park wasdon't filled to the brim with people who had paid a fortune to travel to CA, book a hotel and rental car, and pay the huge entry fee. Nope. The majority of them just hopped in their car, grabbed the ANNUAL PASS, and headed over with all the kids. And just how little do these folks pay per visit? Well looks like most of them paid $80 and a pittance of a monthly fee ($9.92 or some such figure) for a whole YEAR. As many visits as they want. And what's to stop them with sharing these passes with their relatives and friends? By the looks of the crowd and Disneyland, it's pretty obvious that these annual passes are being both heavily used and maybe even abused.So as an out of towner I really resent the fact that I just paid 300 bucks for a couple of hours of enjoyment, coupled with about 6 more hours of misery, so that I could essentially subsidize the locals   who apparently have a different expectation of personal space, and can go to Disneyland for a whole YEAR for the same money I just paid for 1 lame day.Surely Walt Disney is turning over in his grave. And exactly which execs in the Disney came up with this plan? Some guy surely sipping cocktails on his yacht, who would sooner take a bath in a vat of oil than take his own kids to Disneyland.",1
"Liked It's a Small World, Pirates of the Carribbean and Jungle Cruise. Disliked most attractions were closed and hardly any characters appeared except for Toy who made a brief appearance.The Florida Disneyworld is much better choice, especially Epcot.Disneyland is a Money Pit and food choices are poor.",1
"This park was a complete let down!!! For Australians and those from queensland it is no where near as good as dreamworld.The rides I thought would be amazing or special but they did not live up to my expectations. The lines are massive and the fast passes still means you have to wait for 30mins on average. The kids rides were longer than the wait for the larger ones with an average wait time of 40mins. This is on a Friday. Would not even consider going on a Saturday the busiest day.After two days my partner and I were sick of it and diddon't even go back for the 3rd day we paid for, we had already been on majority of rides multiple times. For children, the park is massive and little legs will get very sore considering mine were aching after 2 days.On the plus side there are water fountains everywhere! My advice would be to start with a one or two day pass and if you feel the need, you can upgrade to the next pass and just pay the difference once you have decided if you need the extra time. If your looking for a park in California I found universal studios amazing and interesting. I will not be returning to Disneyland ever. ",1
Disney sucks!!!! No one should ever go there!!!! We spent all day waiting in lines just to make it to the front and be told that the ride was out of commission and they would be shutting it down for an undisclosed amount of time. Our options were to wait or leave and come back later. This happened 4 times today and twice on the same ride! $80 per head and the most action we saw was the tram ride from the parking garage to the park. Save your money and never go to Disneyland!,1
"This park looks the same as it did when I went here forty years ago for the first time. I recently returned and was so disappointed that nothing had changed. I suppose that's what many people tend to like about it, but there are ways to spruce things up with out losing the charm. Looks like nothing has been done to update things. There are just so many people here, even on low days, that you cadon't enjoy yourself. Forget about getting any kind of bargains, that's not possible. It's so expensive to spend a day here that you have wonder how so many people can bring their children here for a holiday. Amazing. ",1
"Everything went wrong! The longest lines on the planet earth. Dirty,smelly, people pushing and shoving to keep their places on an endless line with crying children. Stay at home and save your money! This place is hell on earth! They must pay their PR guys millions!",1
Yesterday my wife & I visited Disneyland   our 2nd trip in 3 months. Last Nov. 2011 we paid over $600 for 2 annual passes. Our Nov. trip was cut short because the Park closed at 6pm for a Company party. Last night in 5 hrs we were able to go on 2 rides (over 2 hours of waiting) and 1 show (World of Color: 1 1 2 hrs waiting). The lines we horrible as rides & staff were reduced. I dodon't know how families can afford Disney's high prices for admission and food. I read recently that Disney Parks continue to be very profitable (year after year) and their executives are getting 10's of Millions of dollars in salary and bonuses. The entry fees increase every year (gotta keep paying those HUGE bonuses). I wonder if this is what Walt envisioned for his Park????,1
"There is no free hot water. How am I suppose to heat up a bottle of cold milk? Secondly, I almost made it past the security checkpoint with a pair of scissors because they had checked the bag and it was good but when I was listing the things I was carrying, I told them about a pair of scissors. They confiscated that. Now how am I suppose to cut up the food. I mean this is suppose to be a family friendly park. ",1
"non stop fun, especially for the younger kids. I recommend small world, and toon town",1
The only things that were amazing was the price of admission and terrible food and the huge trashy crowd.  Nothing but a gaudy carnival with inappropriately sexualized images designed to appeal to children,1
"We planned for many months and budgeted for our trip to take the kids to the one p,ace in the world that they have wanted to go for many years. Well that is the first mistake   actually think that Disneyland valued the safety of all of us and to put that above the almighty dollarWe reviewed and read and reread the reviews and also the beat times to try rides and also the tricks with early entry and fast pass. So far so good butunfortunately the only time that we could get there due to FF seats etc was Christmas and we attended Day 2 on boxing DayThis was a terrible call as the place was a zoo and the bean counters at Disneyland must have thought al of their Christmases had come at once as they jammed every person they could find (and who had a fistful of dollars to handover) into the parkWe waited for 2 and a half hours on the space mountain ride due to the fact that the ride broke down and by the time that we got off the ride the fast passes was providing times some 4 hours laterOne of the critical issues that we identified on this day was that emergency exits were blocked, there were no safety messages or announcements and in one case all exits were blocked, After the events of 9 11 and a major focus on emergency preparedness and response across the whole of the US I was absolutely gobsmacked at the inability of Disneyland to accommodate the most basic of HSE and proactive risk management strategies that I have observed even in thirld world countries.It is apparent that Disneyland put the almighty dollar before the safety of patronsLastly the message that I have is that you should never plan to go to Disneyland at Christmas instead try Knottsberry Farm which is better value, has (in my opinion) an excellent patron safety protocol and last of all puts patrons before revenue",1
"If you go to Disneyland DO NOT ever go the day after Christmas or New Years Eve. Everyplace I have ever been has a maximum limit on admissions (not to say I'm special, I bought my tickets on line well in advance) but it seems that D Land thinks it is exempt   pack 'em in and make some bucks! If someone were to yell fire on New Years Eve the stampede would have been uncontrollable and surely someone and or children could have been trampled to death! With the cost of the tickets and how expensive everything in the park is I think we should all go to a different theme park   Sorry Disneyland but I think your time is done with and I will not ever go back.....(by the way   the fireworks on the day after Christmas had to be canceled because of the crowds   crowd vs. fire hazard, way to go Disney...)",1
Disneyland has never disappointed me till last night . I bought an annual pass around 5 walked to the Disneyland gates only to get sent away to Cali adventures. I tried to explain I diddon't come for California adventures I just came for Disneyland the cast members were so rude diddon't help me just kept sending me to window after another window and when I asked if i'd be able to come back on a day my pass was blocked they answered with   I'm sorry nothing we can do  I just feel I should and everyone else from last night get a day they paid for back! something cause THEY MADE A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY DIDdon't MATTER !!! but they diddon't have a problem taking my money ! I dodon't see why no one can help me !!!!! ,1
"I know that the week between Christmas and New Year's is a very busy time for Disneyland and all the theme parks in southern California, so I expected long lines and thick crowds. It was much worse than I imagined! The crowds were so large that maneuvering around several areas required us to shuffle our feet slowly, watching for stroller wheels next to us, elbow to elbow with the other guests   literally. The wait times for the popular rides ranged from 90 minutes to 180 minutes. Yes, the staff was exceptional, as always, but it would have been an enjoyable visit if HALF as many guests had been admitted. Walt has been gone for many years and it appears to me that the current management errs on the side of greed rather than maintaining a good quality experience. I have lived my entire life within a couple hours drive of Disneyland in Anaheim   I have good memories of the place. After this miserable experience, I do not plan to ever visit again, unless they change their policies and practices. Oh, incidentally, we spent a total of $234 parking, getting in and eating   for just 2 people.",1
"We love, love, love Disney World (Orlando, FL) and have been several time during the peak times. We found Disney Land horrible! I am so disappointed that we wasted our time, money and energy on Disney Land! Despite the lights for Christmas   this place lacked any Magic whatsoever! It was so so so overcrowded   it was miserable. 120 min wait for rides and they stopped handing out fast passes.",1
"We have read that coming to Disney on Christmas would be a great experience for our family. Well, it was a great disappointment. Let's begin with it costs over $400.00 to get into Disney for a family of four, so for that price your expectations are allowed to be high. It was crowded, beyond belief, but hey its Christmas so that was expected. Our first stop was Space Mountain to get a Fast Pass time, ride broken. Our second stop was the Matterhorn, ride broken. Our third stop was Indiana Jones, ride broken. Our fourth stop was the Haunted House, ride broken. Need I say more? This is how our entire day went, no Fast Passes and almost all rides broken all day. Needless to say, we will not return. We recommend Universal, Knotts or something else, until Disney fires its ride engineers and learns how not to ruin Christmas for over 60,000 people. Bottom Line   Disney has some serious issues and the  Murphy's Law  excuse we got all day just does not cut it. ",1
"We went to Disneyland on 11 20 11 when we arrived it was great, then the heavens opened and it was rained out. We thought we would still make the best out of it BUT Most of the rides were closed due to the rain, how does that happen? The staff were incredibly rude, we tried to go through a bag check (which was open) to get back to our shuttle, and the rude security officer  snapped  at us and told us to go through the one further up which made us have to walk further with a five and six year old soaking wet, we turned around and saw that they were then letting people out that way. They dont seem to have a plan when it is raining and the staff turn into the wicked step mother in Cinderella when it rains, they are just mean. I personally will not be going back to Disneyland for a very long time. Happiest place on earth................NOT, Walt Disney would NOT be happy.",1
"We went here with family and friends who were staff and had won tickets. Our 2 1 2 yr old was so looking forward to the visit and coulddon't wait to trick and treat. She got dressed up in a spider oufit with a nice little pumpkin trick and treat bag eager to get some sweets. Our friends had told us we could enter the park at 5pm so we arrived at 5.30pm only to discover we coulddon't enter until 6pm. Then we discovered we coulddon't enter until 7pm as they were empting the park of the normal public so we could enter. This took forvever. I dodon't know what Disney were thinking of from doing this as it was a school night for American children and 7pm??? most kids would be getting ready for bed. Our little one was agitated, tired and eager to enter the park. When they finally let us in the gates we had to wait at Main Street for another 15 minutes....Well our little one was asleep by then and who could blame her. She missed everything she was eager to do and see all day so we just had our dinner and left......disgusted with Disney for this event.",1
"The lines for rides are too long. Yes, the fast passes help a little but standing in line for an hour  only to get a 5min ride is ridiculous. This was my 3rd trip and I feel like it keeps getting worse and longer. There's more people and less space and rides to go on. This could just be the days I've gone on but I think I'll be sticking to other parks that aredon't as busy. I'm sure however if you're here with young impressionable children they will love it and not notice that. I'm just past the age where I can stomach this kind of work to reward ratio.",1
"We were at the Disneyland hotel park this weekend...it is really tough to navigate around due to all the construction. Also, while the park hotel members tell you that the Park is always under remodel   this is most construction I have ever seend and it is frustrating and hotel prices are extremely high along with the park...maybe a discount would be nice...",1
"Since the children were out of school and we were off work for the Holiday we decided to celebrate our grandchildren's 3rd and 6th birthdays at Disneyland, Anaheim on Dec. 27th! What a mistake that turned out to be. Along with a few hundred thousand other people our 16 hour day netted 4 rides total...yes FOUR for the whole day. The crowds were so brutal, navigating with 2 small children and our somewhat slow adult son with a developmental disability was nothing short of a bad dream! I would be hard pressed to recommend a trip to Disneyland during a holiday, but I suspect the crowds at any time would make it less than appealing! Disneyland has lost it's charm on me!",1
"Our 7 and 8 yrs old hated it and wanted to go back to the hotel's swimming pool. And as far as my wife and I were concerned, it was a true waste of money. We purchase a three day pass and did not want to go back on after the first day. Truly our kids begged us not to take them back there again. We met other parents who were feeling the same way. I think the park was filled with parents, who had their own childhood memories of Disneyland. We would never go back there again, and frankly, I was unable to give away our remaining 4 tickets to any of our friends.",1
"Rather than being the happiest place I'd say Disneyland in summer is more akin to Hell on Earth. We paid $420 for hopper tickets to both parks for four people. My wife and I coulddon't be bothered with the massive queues for all the attractions whilst our more stoic teenage children threw themselves into it and managed four rides each all day. The place was heaving from opening to last thing at night ( we took the middle of the day off and returned in the evening hoping it would be quieter. Quite the reverse unfortunately). Unless you were willing to queue for up to an hour there was nothing to do but sit and watch the multitude shuffle by. No, forgive me, we did manage to see the animatronic Abraham Lincoln by which time I was coming over all John Wilkes Booth. Absolutely horrible. As Theme Parks go Universal is so much better and infinitely classier. To end on a positive, a big thumbs up to the oven baked pizzeria in Downtown Disney. A beacon of yumminess on an otherwise dismal and expensive day.",1
"We went for one day and I have to say, it was awful. We've been to the parks in Florida multiple times and absolutely love them. Disneyland was a stark contrast. Absurdly crowded, awful wait times, insensitive staff, and completely overpriced. You shoulddon't have to pay over $100 per ticket to only get to ride 2 or 3 rides. With an average wait time of over 90 minutes the kids were ready to kill one another. We will never be back.",1
"I texted my friend saying we've been at Disneyland for 6 hours and havedon't riden a ride yet!First the line line for tickets,then told to line up here for a lanyard. they say hurray to each of the rides you want to ride to get a fast pass ticket. Theres a line there too. Then the rides breakdown. Then the way they hurd you in for the World of Color show is like we were a bunch of cattle. Then after waiting with the hurd for the show you dodon't even get a place to sit. You stand like a hurd of cattle.",1
"After visiting Disneyland annually we were so disappointed this year. It was shoulder to shoulder crowds   you could barely walk through the park much less get on a ride. The rides would say 60 minute wait but ended up taking nearly 2 hours! We WAITED IN LINE to get a fastpass for Star Tours first thing in the morning and the ticket was for 11:oo pm (yes   11:00 at night) making it impossible to use fast passes the rest of day. We waited in line to board the bus to the parking lot at the end of the day too! Disney California was just as crowded. It was a zoo and the stroller people were so RUDE   using the strollers as weapons to push through the crowds. We for the first time in 25  years of going hated our day in Disneyland   how very, very sad! We went on a Wednesday!! We are hearing it's even worse on weekends   could this be possible?? It will be a long while before we return. So much for a recession   you'd never know it in Disneyland.",1
"First, let me say, I love Disneyland, BUT...we went on a Tuesday (June 7th), and the crowds were a nightmare... this is the first time I've been to Disneyland where I wanted to leave as soon as I went through the main gates... But, I forged ahead, since my son was with me and wanted to go. People were packed into the park like sardines, it was just awful. We have Socal Passports, and maybe that's part of the problem! Like others, I think there are too many local people visiting for only half the day... and it's making this a miserable place! Time to stop selling annual passes, since it's no fun to go anyways, 9 times out of 10. Please, Disneyland, do SOMETHING about overcrowding... we were there for 7 hours and we went paddling on the canoes, went on Pirates (although it did break down in the middle of the ride) ... and Autopia w Fastpasses and that's it. Everything else that I saw... easily 45 min waits, if not more. What else... we diddon't want to wait 2 hours for Star Tours (Fastpass was sold out) so we missed that... Big Thunder Mt.(my fave ride)  CLOSED for the day... I did enjoy the tostada I ate for lunch though... so one highlight! Maybe this was just a peak day for crowds, although we also went in March on a Wednesday and it was almost as bad. It's really a joke going when it's this crowded. And I felt very sorry for everyone who came from out of state!",1
"I have loved Disney for as long as I can remember  my house is decorated Disney style, I know the parks like the back of my hands   I am known as Tink around town.....you get the picture. We paid $40 per plate to see this show up close. Not only was the service at the restaurant terrible  we received our entrees before our drinks  but we were given wrong information about when we could get in for our reserved  standing spots  that we could see very little of the show. Unlike Fantasmic, most of the show is down low on the water  which if you are tall you wont have a problem but if you are on the short side or have children you will not be able to see unless you are first in line. They open at 7:30 for the early showing   we were told to go at 8:15. With priority standing  $40 dinners you get to be let in with all the other priority diners  it is a free for all!!!! Dodon't get a late dinner. You are better off getting a fast pass   get one first thing in the morning as soon as the park opens and save your money. The bridge going to Ariels grotto is a good viewing spot. Get against the rail if you are short!!! The attraction is a five the priority seating is a rip off!",1
"Disneyland has proven to be all about getting your money and NOT caring if you have a good time.It is no cheaper in the off season, but more rides are closed due to refurbishment. More rides were closed than what they listed on their website, and when we got there, more rides were closed than listed at the front gate.We went at 10am and were done with Disneyland by 4pm   we'd even ridden our favorite rides a couple of times.So, you can go in the off season and  maybe  have less people, but also less rides (your favorites may be closed). Or go in season and wait hours to ride the rides.We contacted Disneyland after we returned home because we had such a horrible time, and they did not care one bit. We wanted some of our money back because so many rides were closed, and Disneyland said  no . They said we could have enjoyed the rides that were actually open, so no discount. Our disappointment did not matter to them.We might go back, maybe once every ten years?",1
My family has been traveling to Disneyland for vacations for over 40 years. This was the worst trip ever.I have been during the so called busy times such as spring break and Christmas and summertime many times before. My visit on April18 19 2011 was just awful. It was so crowded that in the two days we spent there we were only able to make it halfway around the park. Lines for rides were over an hour long and it took forever to walk anywhere cause it was shoulder to shoulder people. What a complete waste of time and money. My kids hate Disneyland now cause they had such an bad experience.,1
"My daughter her fiance and myself visited Disneyland in August last year in August, very very very disappointed!!! We live in Australia (Brisbane),so as you know we traveled a long long long way to visit Disneyland our plan was really just to visit Los Angeles as l am a huge huge huge huge Michael Jackson fan,but we thought we cannot go all the way to America and not visit Disneyland so we bought a 2 day park hopper thinking that we would need that long!!! We did not even stay 1 day,we were staying at Ho Jo across the road,that hotel was just alright have stayed in better. So any ways as we said very disappointed,very very over rated,the second day we were suppose to go back to Disneyland we opted out and paid for the day tour back to Los Angeles and did the Wax musuem and half day shopping trip instead that was a good tour our tour bus driver (Alex) was fantastic.We live not far from Gold Coast in Australia and our (One) off theme park Dreamworld and White Water Mountain is WAY WAY WAY better.I recommend that park to anyone even people who live in America.But hey do not get me wrong l absolutely LOVE LOVE America,Los Angeles is the most best place to visit.My father and myself are visiting again in September this year 2011,and cannot wait this will be my fathers first time to America so l will be going back to Disneyland again but will do it as my dad wants to visit,but we will be staying at the Fairfield Inn Marriott this time,looks better then HO Jo,when we went last year we ate at MiMi's cafe loved it will be eating there again this year!!! I recommend who ever reads this that if you ever get an opportunity to visit Australia visit Dreamworld you will not be disappointed!!!!!",1
"I purchased our tickets for Disneyland online before arriving in California. This was the biggest waste of money EVER! Disney was SO CROWDED you could barely move. People have those ridiculous double wide strollers and (they should be outlawed), I dodon't know how they even get around the park with them. We were there ALL DAY and was only able to go on 3 rides total. The lines were CRAZY and people were line jumping and there wasdon't any way to stop them. The people who work there weredon't friendly. There was NOTHING magical about this experience AT ALL. My two kids (age 7 and 10) were MISERABLE and had we not spent a FORTUNE on the admission tickets, we would have turned around and gone back to our hotel. We met other people who had planned on going and we talked them out of it. What a disaster!Disney World in Florida is far nicer, larger, cleaner, etc.",1
"Sorry to say that Disney has not thought this one through at all. You must either get there very early or you miss 80 % of the shows effects, buying the picnic or dining package helps none whatsoever. Truthfully, at least 60 70 % of the people see only the tops if the fountains, but disney put 80% of the show very low on the sprays, just like Fantasmic. Let Fantasmic be the projector on the sprays show and World of Color be only tall shooting fountains, lights and lasers. If they feel they must have the show be so low in the water, then those who bought reserved dining option should be in front without having to line up just as early as those who bought nothing. There is NO perk to buying the meal. yes it says you can start lining up 30 60 min's before the show, we lined up 35 minutes before and got the back. The right way is to have the reserved areas for those buying either dining option sit near the front, eliminating the need to line up 1 hour before the show. THAT should be the perk.Is stupid that they close the best ride in the park, California Screamin' for this poorly thought out show.To be fair, if you line up very early, you probably get a great view. If you do not, do not even bother! Go ride Tower of Terror instead.",1
"My family is not wealthy by any means, but we wanted to take my kids to Disneyland. We finally arranged a trip to California and Disney was the main goal. We got there at opening time and there is way too much gimmicky overpriced stores to have to walk thru to get to the rides. Then when it comes time to wait in line for a ride, prepare for a standing wait of up to an hour or more. My son is severely handicapped. By noon the park was so crowded, he was gettng jostled, pushed, shoved. We finally found where to get a large stroller but with the crowds it was next to impossible to push the stroller thru. The lowlite of the day was when we went on the Haunted Mansion ride. There were so many people crowded into the ride that I couldnt see or hear what was going on. At one point, people are told to hop onto some moving cars to continue on to the end of the ride. There were 4 of us in the group. My mother and other son managed to get on a car. My son and I were being left behind and it was EXTREMELY hazardous for my son with a paralyzed leg to  hop  onto a moving car that is in water. As I saw my mother and other child disappearing, I THREW my handicapped child into an already occupied car and jumped into it AS IT MOVED. Then I angrily told the female attendant  THIS BOY IS DISABLED . at which time she shrugged and said  WELL, YOU DIDNT TEL ME . There is no way I could have told her anything because of the crowd and noise level in the room. I sat there thru the rest of the ride and cried, my arms shaking. Totally ruined my trip to be mistreated and have my son at risk. Many rides at Disneyland are old and outdated, with tinny music and dirty cars. The crowd level is dangerous and ridiculous. The prices are way too high. But mostly, I give this park a THUMBS DOWN for special needs people.",1
"Okay, I admit it... I just dodon't get it. I took my 7 year old godson for his first visit and even he was disappointed. We went on a Monday and got there at 8:30a.m. Our nearly 9 hours in the park included more than 5 hours in line (including 2 fast passes), and less than 40 minutes actually experiencing the 7 attractions we managed to get on. We might have had an extra 5 minutes of attraction if they haddon't closed Space Mountain just as we were walking up for our fast pass time. Late in the day I asked my little friend if he wanted to take a break for dinner and then go on more rides and he said, I'd rather go home if it's okay with you. There are just too many people.  And I diddon't say one negative word to him about our day either during or after. My impression as a first time visitor... The Happiest Place on Earth is a grinding, exhausting place full of mostly unhappy people trudging between lines who become animated only when they are screaming on a roller coaster.",1
"I'll start by saying that we live in Southern California and are annual pass holders. We have been to Disneyland and California Adventure approximately 15 times this year. This was our last time to go before our annual passes expired. We started the day by riding the California Screamin roller coaster. No complaints here. It was fun and entertaining. My seven year old loved it. After a few more rides we wound up in Disneyland searching for something to eat. That's when we stumbled into the recently renovated Village Haus restaurant. We ordered our food at the counter and sat down to eat. I inspected my hamburger and noticed the patty was cold with a wierd bluish gray color. My impression was it was a frozen patty that had been thawed under a heat lamp and slapped on a hamburger bun. The lettuce was yellowish with small brown spots on it. The fries were cold and soggy, resembling wet noodles. I had serious thoughts about taking it back, but what do you say? Excuse me, can you take this hamburger back because it's looks totally disgusting? I picked the nasty lettuce off and reluctantly ate as much of the hamburger that I could stand before I left the rest on my paper covered basket. My seven year old boy got the kids hamburger meal. It was rediculously small resembling more of a biscuit than a hamburger. It was made up of a tiny bun with a small cold gray meat patty resting inside. There were no condiments or anything even on the side. His fries were cold and soggy. He actually ate the hamburger, which surprised my wife and I, but when he was done, he complained that he was still hungry. I felt bad for my son that he was still hungry. It doesdon't take much to fill up a seven year old boy and he's still hungry! Are you kidding! Now to my other son. He ordered a kids pizza meal. It was the smallest excuse for a pizza I've ever seen. Come on Disney! You've spent a couple thousand dollars this year for season passes, parking, food, and enternainment. You provide the best entertainment in the world and I have to feed my family this gross crap. We left hungry and disgusted. Since this was our last day to use our season passes before they expired, my wife and I were debating on renewing our passes. This experience made us decide to let our passes expire. I left the park feeling irritated and totally ripped off.",1
"Myself, along with my two chidren ages 8 and 17 visited Disneyland California from December 15   21. We experienced a half day of reasonable weather on Dec. 15, and thereafter the heavens opened up, and it poured, like nothing we had experienced before, for the next 5 days straight. The main problem with this, is that there is extremely little drainage in the entire Disneyland Park. This made for small lake size pools of water throughout the Park. The huge deluge of water everywhere in the Park, for days on end, also caused approximately fifty per cent of the rides to be closed at any given time, for the duration of our holiday. Not good, when you have paid several thousand dollars, for a family Disneyland vacation, during Christmas. This was extremely disappointing, to my two children, and myself. Disneyland gave guests no compensation for operating at approximately fifty per cent functionality. I find this business practice to be completely unethical. Also, when I asked various Disney employees, why they were closing numerous rides, they dismissed me, walking straight past me, without speaking. Very arrogant and rude. This was our fifth and last trip to Disneyland California. In the future, we will choose a holiday destination, where we will be treated decently, and where the weather is more predictable.",1
"Just returned from Disney and it gets worse every time I go. I think the Disney company has lost sight of what the park was supposed to be: Fun. There is a sign at the end of Mainstreet USA that indicates the wait time for the  major  attractions. By shortly after lunch: space mountain: 120 min, pirates: 90 min, indiana jones: 100 min, etc... how is this fun? The shortest of these rides was a wait time of 70 min. We talked to a park official and he indicated 88000 for the day we attended. We rushed through the gates at 8am and ran straight to Indiana Jones and were told the ride is down come back later. We then ran to Space Mountain, lined up, got on the ride, our car started to move, lights came on, announcement: ride is malfunctioning and you are being evacuated; ride broken come back later. Back to Indiana Jones: still broken. As they day went on we got on some of the rides. The crowd grew. As the parade was about to start we were accosted by rude staff as we attempted to walk to Fantasyland and were told we need to be moving in a counter clockwise direction to walk there which amounted to around the whole park which diddon't make any sense since we were about 50 yards from the castle? Way too full. If there is over an hour wait on EVERY major ride there is a problem. Not enough attractions? Too many people? Bad crowd control? Not pleasurable at all. Is this what Walt wanted?And I wodon't even start on $8.10 for a sandwich!",1
"This review probably wodon't even reach the web. I swear the bad reviews are filtered by the rat himself. It makes no sense to me that sooo many people give this place good reviews. We were at Disneyland on 12 27 and 12 28 2010. Turns out so were 80,000 fellow suckers. I cannot fathom why so many people would subject themselves to waiting in line for $80 per person per day. We waited an hour to park, a half hour to board the shuttle buses to drop us in line to wait another 1 2 hour to get into the park, only to be herded down main street to enter one of many excruciatingly long ride lines. One of which exceeded 2 hours for the 2:42 min. duration Space Mountain ride unbelieveable. (First time we tried to ride Space Mt. we waited for 1 2 hr only to be told by Space Commander Tom that the ride was down and  check back later in the day to see if it was up and running.  This happened to us on the Indiana Jones ride as well, but thankfully we had just shuffled into line when that news was dropped on us.)We got a great deal with plane flight, hotel and rental car, but I kept thinking of the foreign suckers that shelled out probably twice what I did to enter the rat trap. Tokyo $1,600, France $800...Hopefully they got deals like we did, but can you imagine hauling 4 people halfway across the globe to basically wait in line at the  Happiest place on Earth?  (It's like political talking points If you float it out there, many will actually believe it without looking into it guilty.)On the second day we were considering leaving at noon to take the kids to the beach (my idea), but I was voted down. I would have loved to see the kids be able to run in the sand instead of stand in line ride on my worn out shoulders again. I have read another review of a guy that  enjoyed spending time in line with the family chit chatting.  (Hey Scandanavian Donald from Newport, I'll flip the bill for your whole family to return to Disney if you can send me a video of your family just  chit chatting  in line for 2:15 hrs.)I know there are ways to beat the crowds (fast passes you're only allowed one per family at a time and they sell out by around 10am), but I shoulddon't have to work the system when I'm paying $80 for a ticket. Disney owes its customers to alleviate the crowds by limiting the number of people through the gate or putting all that revenue to work and create a thinktank to streamline the process.Bottom line Ask your friends about their experiences. We sprung it on the kids on Christmas morning so I diddon't spread it around with fear that the cat would get out. On my return two co workers said,  You should have asked me, I would have told you it was going to suck.  And suck it did.",1
horrible experince with my three year old daughter. It was so crowded there were even lines to get into gift shops. I did not bother trying to make my daughter wait 2 hours in line for the peter pan ride.disney obviously pays the fire department to look the other way in terms of overcrowding. Walt is turning in his grave seeing his guests treated like this: squeezing the life out of them for every penney to maximize profit.they pay their employees so badly that only overweight desperate grandmas in need of income will work there. they dont even look at you and smile. they are too buzy being depressed.,1
"We visited Disneyland today, my wife, myself and my 3 year old son attended.I dodon't know where the park managers get the idea that they can safely pack the number of people in to the park that they do and have any degree of safety.The management obviously has not a care for their patrons' fun or enjoyment either. The wait for anything was at minimum an hour to ninety minutes with SO many more people than the park was ever designed to deal with..The place was obviously designed for maybe 20% of the number of people who they actually let in.It seems that the only thing the park wants is money, nothing else.The Parking was exceptionally expensive, the tickets were exceptionally expensive, and what did we get for it? There were no employees on the grounds, except ones selling things or palpably miserable overworked minimum wage teenagers running the rides.We left in disgust after 2 and a half hours of misery, nothing could salvage ANY part of the experience. It was literally the worst time I have ever had at a park like this, and there was nothing special going on, IT'S ALWAYS this bad!Save your money and your time, go elsewhere, Universal City Walk is much much nicer, less crowded, cost less and was more modern. They could not pay me to go back here.",1
"First, this is the only review I have ever written  I have noticed that Disneyland has felt less and less personal the past few times we have gone (we are southern Cal. residents). It seems that what was once a well oiled machine, has become very robotic and cold (not to mention $$$$$). Number one: Beware of the guy at the nearby Marriott (an employee of Disney) who sells the tickets to Disneyland. We had three families all staying there to avoid morning traffic as we were to meet an entire kindergarten class the next morning. We all bought our tickets at different times, however when we met up for dinner, we had all been sold three day tickets, and we were all baffled at how masterful the guy was at talking us up before we knew it. Had it only happened to one of us, you could say it was just one of us being gullible, but all three of us? Number two: Part of the scam was that we (each) asked if it was reasonable to go to the California Adventure for the light show (since we had a night to fill). Without any mention of anything extra needed, we were sold these three day things so we could view the show. He told us the time of the show, but neglected to tell us that a fast pass is required (and those are gone by mid morning usually)  So, we all have our $$$ 3Day passes, and keep our 10 very young children up late by going to a very loud restaurant on Disney Way (all restaurants had long waits). Then, we go into the Disney Adventure to see the light show, and we just keep getting ushered down a street by  cast members  with flashlights...We think we are being ushered to the show, but after tremendous amounts of walking with now very tired children, we figure out (by asking one of the wavers on) that we cadon't see the show without a Fast Pass (we did not know what that was). Even though there was PLENTY of room behind a rope surrounding the edges of the street, we were not allowed to either go inside the rope to watch or even stop where we were standing. I dodon't know if you can imagine, but three Moms and ten tiny children at 9:30PM walking endlessly, and being told they cannot stand for a moment. One Mom stood for a minute with her child to get a glimpse, and security was called. When we promised not to stand, the followed us from behind a little, making sure we kept moving. Needless to say, we were all furious that were sold 3 Day passes only to miss the whole reason we bough them  A pure scam. Number three: Disney Customer Relations: After all this, I at least wanted my money back for the night we just walked and were not allowed to do anything in the Park. The customer service was the worst I have ever encountered. Instead of acting sympathetic, they were cynical and argumentative. The person I spoke with loved to talk, and would give long explanations for why they actually did nothing wrong. After two separate conversation, and then asking for a supervisor, I again found the same defensive and unhelpful, unaccommodating attitude. It was as though they had memorized scripts. It was a very big disappointment to us all.",1
"Went to Disneyland with the kids at Easter time and it was so crowded you coulddon't see 2 feet in front of you. The wait to get any food in the park was as long as half an hour at the little snack stands and several hours at any of the sit down restaurants. The lines at the attractions were generally 75 minutes or so, and even when we got fast passes first thing in the morning, we coulddon't do the ride til 9:30 at night. Some of the rides, like space mountain, were completely out of fast passes. We waited in line for HOURS and then when we finally got on the ride, it was...nothing. A roller coaster in complete darkness. Long lines at the Matterhorn for a sad little roller coaster with really hard seats that trundled past a shopworn  abominable snowman  and some plastic  ice crystals . Totally out of date and crummy. At California Adventure, we thought we'd get to ride the big roller coaster, but it was shut down for the day, no refunds. Same with the big ferris wheel. Not much else to do there for kids older than 9 except for the Tower of Terror (truly terrifying, a good ride if you like that kind of thing) and the Drop Zone ride, same thing as Tower of Terror only outdoors. On teh other hadn, Universal Studios was not crowded, fun, hip, and completely entertaining, with great shows, amazing stunts and fun rides.",1
"The food inside the park was such a disappointment. Fried, gross, only two choices for salad dressings. All the places are cafeteria style, no relaxation, we tried a different place every day for four days and never found one single place we would go back to. If you like county fair food for your whole trip you wodon't be disappointed.",1
I jusat returned from a trip to Disneyland with my three boys. We went in Christmas day and it was a nightmare. It was so crowded it took nearly 2 hours to get on most of the rides. I was so disappointed after a few hours we decided to leave. It was so hard to even push my stollar though the park and it took nearly 35 minutes to get a corn dog from some vendor. It seemed like the park just let in as many people as possible without any concern for anyone other than profits.,1
"Friday night at 7 pm, unbelievably crowded in  Downtown Disney . I was a single person visiting. the moral of this story is dodon't go to this resort if you're single. I first went to a Cajun Restaurant, Ralph Brennans. I was told there was only room for at the bar, although I saw several vacant tables. The hostess diddon't have to courtesy to look to see that the bar was already completely full.The House of Blues restaurant was completely closed for a special event. Every other restaurant had at least a 45 minute wait, up to 1.5 hours. At this point it was 8pm.. I was ravenous. I returned to the Napa Rose restaurant, inside the Resort. Again, empty tables all around, but I was told I would have to eat at the packed bar. There were two chairs and I would be smashed together with strangers, but I was starving. 15 minutes passes, a waiter diddon't even make eye contact me. I was furious. I went to the hostess and asked if there was ROOM SERVICE at the resort, and they said yes. I lodged a stern complaint with the manager of the Restaurant. First, it was obvious I was being denied a table because I was a single, and the restaurants diddon't want to lose out on more revenue. Second, the resort is HORRIBLY unprepared for this volume of guests for dinner. The manager was nice enough to comp my room service dinner, but heck whats the point of going to Disneyland to eat by yourself in your room?If you're going on a busy weekend, be prepared for a LONG wait for dinner, rude service people and huge crowds. My first night on a group tour, I was so bummed I diddon't go to the first night event. I would actually like to check out early. Disneyland is not for singles, and the group that invited me made it appear we would be accomodated for.",1
"one of the most overblown  family  destinations I've had the displeasure to visit.  Be prepared to stand in long lines, the hot sun in summer and pay thru the nose for everything except bathroom use.",1
"We tried to enjoy our two days at Disneyland, but everything kept breaking down. We waited forever to get on Splash Mountain, and when we finally got on the log, the ride broke down after a couple minutes and we were told we would have to get off and climb down. Then the Indiana Jones ride broke down, the Peter Pan ride was under construction, there was an hour wait to meet Tinker Bell, and even just buying a snack on the street took twenty minutes. This was only day one. For myself, and my two kids, it was a $600 weekend, and it was definately not worth the time or the money. I requested getting some of our money refunded due to all the mechanical problems, but they said no and gave us an extra fast pass. The soaring California ride at California Adventure was beautiful!",1
"I really dodon't see what all the fuss is about,I cannot belive all these reviews saying how fantastic this place is. I can only imagine they are putting something in the overpriced food and drinks.I went with my family in April and found it dreadful.We had tickets as part of a pack but when we got to the end of the line we were rudely sent back to the ticket purchase booth to change the voucher into a ticket.There were very long queues for everything but you could put your ticket in a machine that gave you a slot later in the day   everyone we tried gave a time 6 hours ahead !.My daughter wanted to see 'Captain Jack Sparrow' who was there but we were turned away just before we got to the end of the line 'as her had to go on his lunch break'. Now dodon't get me wrong but it wasdon't Johnnie Depp, with the prices that Disney are charging coulddon't they have two !All the staff gave a very bored fixed smile but at the end of the day treated everybody with distain and 'guests' were just pushed along without any sincerity.Numerous rides were not working or temporarily out of order.Going back to California next year and will definately be avoiding this place.Recommend San Diego Animal Park, San Diego Zoo or Universal Studios instead !",1
"It hurts my heart to dis Disneyland. I got to go here for my birthday the year after it opened. It is a part of my childhood, my teen years (dates and grad night); part of my child's childhood, and a place I could not wait to bring my only granddaughter to. OK I'm done. I will never step foot in the place again. Broken rides: Pirates, Indiana Jones, Splash Mtn or Thunder Mt.   whatever   down off and on all week end.Monolithic Crowds: it was impossible to walk two steps without tripping over a stroller. Great, heaving , sticky, sweating, tattooed, pierced, and sunburned masses.Fast Pass: a complete joke   worthless worthless worthless   dodon't bother. They make it so complicated   you cadon't reserve fast pass tickets for more than one ride at a time. What the use is that? The return time for the Indiana Jones ride was 11:50 to 12:50 PM   and we were at the kiosk at 4:00 PM!!!! We're supposed to come back at nearly mid night? What a joke.Lines: horrific. hours and hours waiting in lines. Fortunately, we stayed at one of the hotels (that's a whole 'nother Oprah) and could get into the park at 7:00 am   the only way I was able to take my g daughter on the Nemo ride   and even then it was a 30 minute wait   with only hotel guests there! Could not get near the thing during regular hours. Fuggeddabougit.Food: breakfast from the place across from the Nemo ride   no problem. Fine. Grab a egg bacon cheese croissant and stuff chunks into the kids as you wait in the Nemo line. Calif Adventure   had mexican food that was virtually inedible   microwaved burrito that was like eating shoe leather. Food in the parks   very chancey. Eat anywhere else but here.Ambience: not crisp, well groomed and perfectly maintained as it used to be. Looks tired and run down. One never saw a leaf out of place or a square inch of chipped paint years ago.The Disney Princesses: worth their weight in gold. Sweetest, most adorable girls on the planet. Just darling. They embody the perfection and fantasy Walt intended. Just enchanting.The Throw Up Rides at Calif Adventure: forget D land unless you have 3 year olds and head straight for C A. The Calif Screamin roller coaster is a good thrill. You feel like you've been shot out of a cannon. Skip the Ferris Wheel   even a 6 year old knows boring when she sees it, and she could not get off this worthless contraption fast enough. Nice strolling, wide open spaces and good ambience, though. Conclusion: save your money and head for Orlando. Now that's a party waiting to happen. Lots going on other than Disneyworld, which is much better than the Calif original. Lots more real estate to spread out over   it's a whole different world built for one purpose and one purpose only   PAR TAY!!!When I got back to the hotel room every day, I stood under the hottest shower I could stand and scrubbed myself all over twice with a stiff loofa. The only way to get off what my daughter called:  :Park Build Up : SPF 45, sweat, cotton candy residue, bbq turkey leg grease... well, you get my drift. Orlando   think Orlando (but not in June, July or August!!!). Cheers!",1
"Having been born, raised, and lived in Southern California for most of my life, Disneyland was an institution visited regularly. This year, my daughter is approaching her 7th birthday, so we decided to take her to Disneyland for a Christmas gift. Once the decision for the gift was made, we had to decide on the day. December 26th!!! We were told by many that the park would not be as crowded as a few days past Christmas. They were DEAD wrong!!!We arrived at the park @ 10am only an hour and a half past it's opening time. The main parking lot was already full and we were directed to overflow parking. This provided us with a half mile brisk morning walk before we could even get to the ticket booths and purchase tickets. After plopping down $500 to get the family in to the park, we were promptly greeted with a crowd size of such magnitude I coulddon't believe it. I have never seen so many people in one place at one time. Many of the people that (cough, cough) inadvertenetly bumped in to us were SoCal locals. One nice lady attempted to run my mother in law down with her stoller and when asked to be more careful, politely responded with  F*** you!  And a Merry Chistmas to you too! The most polite people we found were the ones who diddon't even live near the park. We met a nice Seattle family, who like us, we quite astonished at the attitudes of those around us.So, we spent a total of 6.5 hours in the park. The little ones were so tired of standing in lines that they got to ride on 3 rides each. The big kids (myself included, wink wink) were able to make it on to 5 rides. Is it worth what we spent? I say NO! In fact, my wife and I agree on one thing, if we never see Disneyland again, neither of us will shed one tiny tear.Maybe Disney ought to take some business advice from some much smaller businesses like Snow Summit and the likes. Sell only enough tickets to make money and still allow your guests a great day! Until that day, this family will never set foot back in the  Happiest Place on Earth  and boy is that a subjective statement.",1
"My husband and I dodon't have children, but we thought we would still at least have fun. That cadon't be farther from the truth. We went to Disney on Saturday, May 19th, only to find out that the park was closing early due to a  special event , which turned out to be the premier of the Pirates of the Caribbean   3. We opted to pay the $83.00 to get into Disney and California Adventure   another mistake.When we walked into Disney, there was a red carpet all down main street and people sitting around in sleeping bags, chairs, etc. and you could barely walk around. It was not possible to cross the street because of the press hoopla and the red carpet. Then, as we made our way through Disney, many different sections were closed because of the  special event'. Several of the rides were closed and the lines for those that were open were ridiculous. I went into one of the gift shops and asked the lady at the counter if it was always this busy and she said this was nothing and that typically, you can barely walk around. Ugh. We paid a regular priced admission, but did not have access to the entire park and the park closed early. Granted we dodon't have kids, but this experience has completely turned us off on any future Disney visits. Even if we have kids in the future, we won   t go back.",1
We traveled from Indiana to go to Disney.The park is much smaller than Florida. The lines are unbearable. No kidding   we waited 90 mins then got out of line at Space Mountain.The food is extreemly expensive and the workers could care less.The park is so over crowed that literally had people bumping into us all day long.The ride lines are unbelievable. Attaractions are simply awefullGet ready to spend $600 $700 for a family of four for two days (without hotel).Disney is a once in a lifetime visit. It's too expensive and to crowed to go more than once.Very Disapointed.,1
This was the first and last time my wife and I will travel to Disneyland . Service was incredibly terrible and people decided to quit working in the middle of the day. A freind of ours came with us. He had older Disney world tickets that were good at disneyland. A member of guest relations had to come and take his card and read it on another computer to make sure it was valid. we waited for 1 2 hour before someone came to take his card. In the meantime I went to guest services and asked for someone to help us. The response I got was  it's not my job . another response I got from an employee when trying to get help was  that Sucks!  and then that employee walked away. Large portions of the park were closed off for no apparent reason preventing us from even leaving the park. It made walking through the park incredibly difficult. All but 3 rides closed down at 9:00 in disneyland each night even though the park diddon't close till either midnight or 11:00pm. When in line for big thunder mountain one evening we were ready to get on the train when an announcement came over the loud speaker proclaiming that they were closing the ride for the night. They just decided to quit running the ride even though people had waited 1 2 hour to an hour to get on. A lady next to me asked about her fast passes and the responnse by the employee was that they could get another one tomorrow. We tried to get on the sailing ship columbia one afternoon. A large signed proclaimed  last cruise: 5:45 . It was 5:15 so we attempted to get on and the man working the ride told us sorry we are closed for the day. This is not the type of service that I expect from Disney.,1
Stay out of Toon Town at all costs! My husband took both my children (3 and 5 years old) into Mickey's house for a meet and greet. There was no line or sign outside posting a wait time however he waited inside Mickey's house for over an hour in a dark narrow hall way filled with tired children and parents. There were no cast members around and the Exits were not clearly marked. He ended up moving some props to find an Exit and lead a small exodus to freedom. All the while I sat in Mickey's garage with 8 other abandoned spouses making desperate cell phone calls to our missing families. The streets were lined 3 deep with abandoned Disneyland rental strollers. The entire place smelled of boiled hot dogs. I loved the rest of Disneyland and feel very strongly that the  Imagineers  who created Toon Town should be shamed into becoming grounds clean up workers.,1
"We visited Disneyland during the 50th Anniversary Celebration and for me it was very disappointing. We visited on February 20 22. We purchased the 3 day parker hoppers so we could visit Disneyland and California Adventure. This was the first visit for my girls who at 7 and 4 were very excited about visiting Disney. We took out 7 year old out of school for a few days and thought February would be a good time to visit and we might just avoid the huge crowds that converge on Disney during the summer months. Well, we were wrong. It seems that there isdon't a really good time to visit and avoid the huge crowds. Our first day was a Monday and it was a holiday so we expected them to be crowded since school was out. The following Tuesday and Wednesday were not any better. Seems a lot of other people had the same idea. The only times we were able to ride any of the rides were first thing in the morning. By noon it was impossible to get on any ride without having to wait well over 45 minutes to an hour. Certain rides did have the Fast Pass which did work well but that is only used for certain rides and even then is not always used. There is a line for everything at Disneyland and California Adventure. You wait in a line to have your bags checked before you even enter the park. On the third day the line was really long. Once you enter the park you have to wait in a line to show them your ticket. Once inside the park the lines really start. You wait in a large, crowded group line at Main Street for the actual rides to open. Then when they open there is a mad dash my grown ups with small children and strollers to get to the rides. If your not careful you could be run over. On our visit we knew at least 2 rides would be closed. On the first day we got in line for the Matterhorn only for them to close it as we were walking up because of some problem. We finally got to ride it on the 3rd day but heard later that same day that it was closed again. Spash Mountain was not running the first 2 days, finally at the end of our 3rd day we saw it was running. We eventually were able to ride some of the rides that we wanted to ride. It is just very frustrating and almost like work instead of fun to go on the rides. Even trying to ride the kiddy rides was difficult. We waited for at least 30 40 minutes to ride the tea cups, which my little girls enjoyed very much. I just wondered if the 4 grown men in line ahead of us enjoyed it too. Grown ups waiting in lines for rides that are for small children, I just did not understand. The worst part was probably the very rude people. People who would crowd in front of you so they could get a better view of a parade or a character. They would push their kids right in front of other kids who had been standing in a line to see one of the characters. We stood in a line for about 25 30 minutes for my girls to get a picture and autograph from Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. They did get there picture and autograph but I had to point out to this one man where the line started. Had I not done that my girls would have missed out since the princesses had to leave after seeing my girls. People started lining up along the street at 6:00 for the parade that started at 7:15. We sat a table near Main Street about 30 45 mins and started out with a pretty good view of where the parade would pass by. Just as the parade was getting ready to start, people tried to crowd us out of where we had been sitting. Trying to push their children in front of us, pulling the chairs away from where we had been sitting and even standing on the table. And then these same people were overheard complaining because their children could not see the parade. There were way to many people, the food was overpriced, the Cast Members were not very friendly and we hardly ever saw any of them smile. From my memory of visiting when I was a child it sure seemed to be a lot nicer place to visit. For the price that we paid we came away very disappointed it what we got for our money. It seems the only thing that is important at Disneyland is money. It seems that no one cares about it anymore. Trash in the water, bathrooms smelled and paper and trash in the streets. I'm glad that my girls got to visit Disneyland but it will be a long while before we ever return again. It was just not a very good experience for us. Think twice about spending your money on Disney.",1
"I had previous wonderful experiences there, but there were soooo many people that you could hardly move, could not enjoy anything wonderful there. Disneyland is probably only after the all important buck, instead of enjoyment for their Customers. Numerous rides broke and when they reopened there was only one or two employees to control the Kaos for the line. We even had the Fast Pass equipment break. My family and I may never go back and that is a shame!",1
"August 4, 2005Hello I am a single mom (widow). I have one son, (married with an 8 year old son of his own) and two teenage girls. My children wanted to go to Magic Mountain, but I suggested Disneyland. Since I wasdon't sure if my grandson could go on most of the rides at the other theme park. And I used to love Disneyland. Big mistake on my part. Let me start with admission prices,  way overpriced  I paid $438.00 for 7 adults and 1 child. My daughters took 2 friends. Over $250.00 on just snacks, bottled waters, and dinner.And that does not include the money that my son and his wife spent. I couldon't even afford to get my kids a souvenir this year. But that is not the worst of it. We spent most of our day waiting in line. There should be some kind of limit on how many people are allowed into the park. I know the Disney Corp. really doesdon't care. All they are concerned about is raking in the money. They do not care how miserable people are spending most of their day waiting in lines, for snacks attractions, rides, food, and even the restroom. Well I was very disappointed this year. It will be a long time if ever before we go back to Disneyland. It just keeps getting worse every year. More expensive, too many people. I am sorry but it was not the happiest place on earth for myself and my children.",1
"This is not about what Disneyland is for everybody. That is a fact.We knew about the off school seasson we were visitng it, sorry there were no other time for us, even more, We knew about some loose time and delays in the operation of some attraction, but it couldn be worst.More than 10 hours in the park and could only visiting some minor attractions and three big ones, Haunted mansion, Tiki room and It's a small world, the rest even with the fast lane, were out of order, with the amusemnt park full!!!!!!; I mean it is understandable with a few attractions but all big ones!!!!!!!.I kept the fastlane tickets to show what I am saying.Wrote to Disneyland's contact....Nobody cares....The parade saved this nigthmere called visit.Before go, please find advise on the attractions's behavior",1
"We were visited the Disneyland Resort on Dec 20th to Dec 22th and here are our observation:The park is overcrowded with people and even with the best effort from the staff, is was a dissaster. The average wait for all the rides ranging from 30 min to 2 hours, yes, two hours for a five minutes ride. Somebody will suggest fast pass, but face this, a certain ride can only accomodate a certain amount of park goers per hour, it does not stretching the time or reduce the number of people waiting in turn so it a zero sum game.There is only one bathroom facility per cluster of attraction, says Toon Town, somebody just try to squeeze more rides into same amount of space without giving additional bathrooms or rest areas.The train ride around the park is fine during daylight but at night is totally dark around you with very few lighting, it's very scary for little children to say the least.There is very few signs or kiosk for direction to go from one area of the park to another. The staff at the entrance does not giving out the map or giving instructions to where a particular attraction is.Half way throught the park openning hours, there are trashes everywhere, dodon't blame the staff for not keeping up, I have seen them tried to sweep the trashes while hordes of people streaming around and kicking the trashes around. The real problem is overcrowded condition. I'm supprised that the fire department is not cited this park for safety condition.The saving grace for the trip is not the park itself but the people of Anaheim (hotel maid, grocery clerk, laudromat owner) who're showing their friendliness and hospitality. We will be back but will patron different local attractions instead.The magic is gone, only the quest for money remains at Disneyland.",1
"I will agree that Disneyworld is the happiest place on earth. Disneyland is definately the unhappiest place on earth after fighting crowds for only a few hours. Disneyland is in dire need of customer service and reconstruction to accomodate the crowds. Each theme park in Disneyworld seems to cater to specific age groups. My son being three years old doesdon't need rides that rip his teeth out of his mouth. The MGM Theme Park in Disneyworld catered to smaller rides, puppet shows and low key entertainment. The park has much more room to walk around and lots of stands to buy small items like hot dogs, pretzels, popcorn, ect. Disneyland you will find only snacks that do not contain any other item but sugar...candybars, ice cream bars, soda pop, slushes, etc. If you want real food in Disneyland expect to stand in line at the only 1 or 2 walk up grills, and expect it to be spendy for a sandwich and soda. Oh, there are other restaurants that you can sit down and enjoy a lunch, but for a family of four it will really get spendy. The nice people at Disneyworld never hassle you about your backpacks with one or two bottles of water and a few snacks for your toddler. At Disneyland it is worse that going through airport security. They will confiscate anything edible they can dig out of your bags. My advise....save up the money for flight tickets and spend your money at Disneyworld. It is worth it to visit Mickey and Friends in Florida. You will have a really good time and be treated like royalty.",1
"never again...what a horrible experience, the worst weekend of my life. We went to Disneyland fully understanding that it would be crowded, there would be lines and lots & lots of people..however, there were so many people that you could literally not walk, You had to wait in line to move! Waits for rides were 3 1 2 4 hrs long, waits just to get a speed pass were over 1 hr long. Although we all remained in good spirits and tried to enjoy it, it was impossible. You coulddon't even take a picture of each other, it was too crowded. After only 3 hours on our second day there, my nieces asked to leave. On our way out we stopped at Guest Relations to express our unhappiness, and were directed to yet another lengthy line that we would have to wait in, the line to complain which was approximately 60 people deep. We chose not to wait, instead asking for an address where we could send a letter, and were told to wait in the same line to just get that.....never again, what a shame, we planned for months, and spent an incredible amount of money for the worst 2 days of our lives.",1
Why they selling fastpass tickets without have buy before the entrance tickets???  Any answer ???  Shame on you!!!   We came here from Greece until the entrance!!!  Avoid this place!!!                                                                                                                ,1
"Its a shame this park carry the name Disney... They build the place years back and they are now just collecting cash without any effort, it does not compare in anything with the American parks which are truly amazing. The whole park now is designed to get money from their guests on every step without offering any services. The staff are truly miserable and seems like they hate their job. In the whole park there were no characters walking around at all so a kid can take a picture. There were 3 characters who a kid could meet in the whole park but you had to wait forever just to take a picture. Many rides where closed and the wait time for anything was 60 minutes or more, who in the world can make a a kid stand still in a waiting line for 60 Minutes or more? Avoid at all costs especially if you have young children. PS. Parking is    30 to park 30 minutes walk from the entrance after spending    75 person for your ticket...just ridiculous ",1
"A very disappointing experience.Went with my husband , grandchildren and daughter and her husband for three days.Long queues everywhere, some over an hour for rides which last 5 minutes. We went on 3 rides a day ! Poor signage and lack of information on site. Queues to meet Disney characters , plus charges for photos. All in all there is no Magic, just a money making concern.",1
"Visited Dismal land Paris in April 2019 and what a truly disappointing experience that was! Previously visited other Disney parks in the United States and the gulf between the two coulddon't be more obvious. A very dated, tired park with a few alternative rides, enough to entice you to visit but after your first day of broken rides, endless waiting in line for everything for little to no reward you realise you should have spent elsewhere and boosted some other economy. Park staff are all friendly, rooms are small but clean and if paying for inclusive meals, the food is more than adequate. Cultural differences not withstanding, generally unpleasant and nothing more than a poor substitution for an American idea which should have remained there or at least carefully selected a location where the concept of politeness and courtesy would not be lost. Never again. Do yourself a favour dollar trumps euro on this one, big time.",1
"I've been to Disneyland & Disneyworld in the USA more than 4 times. I've been to Tokyo Disneyland twice, and Hong Kong Disneyland once. Two weeks ago we visited Disneyland Paris for the first time, and it was the WORST!! Even though the park maps show  Smoking in designated areas only  they do not enforce this At.All. Outside of every restroom and restaurant you will find a clump of smokers, as well as anywhere you happen to walk. I realize that Europe is more comfortable with smoking everywherelet this happen? We would show a park employee a smoker and they would then walk right past without saying anything to him or her.At least half of the rides were closed for repairs or updates, and the restaurants kept running out of food, beer & ice cream! Disney calls their employees  cast members  and usually this is fitting based on the employees' energy levels & demeanor. Here, they should be called  employees . There was no excitement, no magic. We saw exactly one employee behaving like a cast member (a pirate outside of Pirates of the Caribbean ride).Our daughter hurt herself on one of the slides in the Pocahontas Playground, which already had a lot of broken slides.It is the worst reflection of the Disney brand I have ever seen. Save your money and DOdon't GO HERE!",1
"I recently travelled to Disneyland Paris with my granddaughter and other family members. We stayed at a nearby hotel called Explorers which was ok, rooms were a bit small and the choice of food wasdon't great but my granddaughter very much enjoyed the pool which had giant water slides. They had a courtesy bus which to you to and from the park which worked out very well. We had passes for both parks and started on the first day with the Disneyland Park. We found that quite a few of the rides were closed, most of the water fountains diddon't work, most of the fast pass machines diddon't work and the park was not really very clean. The staff seemed worn out, a bit surly and not very helpful, even the dancers in the shows were a bit lackluster. The only time we saw a Disney Princess was in the parade, there were queues for more than an hour to have your photo taken with a Disney character. Having visited Disneyland in Florida I expected the brand to shine just as much but the whole experience was very disappointing. I would expect Disney to reduce the price of admission to take into account the number of rides etc which were not working or closed for maintenance. Better still not admit quite so many people as they whole time was spent queuing. One time we queued for 40 minutes for a ride and it broke down just before we got on and the people who were on it were taken off using a step ladder. On average I would say you will spend 80% of your day in a queue. Walt Disney World is a smaller park with the same problems. The two saving graces were the parade and light firework shows. Definitely not the magical experience it should have been. My advice would be to save your money and go to Florida instead.",1
"Price of tickets almost doubled since the last time we entered. Nothing really new to justify. Pure greedy for higher profits. The only magic there it's in your wallet. Souvenirs are crazy expensive(20    for a mug) with little variety (every store had the same stuff all over the place). Expensive food and snacks with very little variety (chips, icecream, hot dog, burger).We will never visit again and I'l discourage anyone who plans to visit to cancel his trip.",1
"As my daughter grew up in southern California we visited Disneyland California adventure many, many times, always enjoyed it. We also visited Disney World one time and had a great time with our park hopper passes. One time while in Tokyo on business in the 90s I found myself at Tokyo Disneyland during an extra day, it was also a fun experience, especially noting the differences between the comparable US versions of rides like Pirates of the Caribbean. So I expected something similar here, I was extremely disappointed. Let's start with the two parks, they are small, with the Disney Studios park being positively tiny. Add to this that many of the more popular rides are shut down for maintenance means there is very little for the throngs on people to do. Also it seems that a large part of Disney Studios is geared to promoting their Marvel franchise, with expensive toys on display everywhere. The rides that are unique to Disneyland Paris, like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril, are awful. The Indiana Jones ride in Disneyland has a story, tied to the movies, that makes the ride fun. The Temple of Peril has none of that, it is just a (short) roller coaster that you would find at any amusement park with a temple facade. No tie to the movie at all. Super disappointing and super long lines. Smoking is banned except in smoking areas but this is ignored, people were smoking everywhere, including the lines where you coulddon't escape it. The super cleanliness you would expect at Disneyland isdon't there, with spilled food ignored on the ground, few cleaners in sight. If you are thirsty, try to find a drinking fountain, I diddon't see one anywhere. Instead you need to wait in a long line to buy some water, or find a vending machine that isdon't broken. Oh, and one more thing, we got on a Flying Carpet ride, kind of like the Dumbo ride (which was out of service). One of the cars was covered over with tape, it was broken. Some of the parts in our car were missing, too. I have never seen anything like this at any other Disney park. I guess Disney figures it can make money without worrying about these things, they have the only Disney park in Europe, but if you have tried the other parks, dodon't waste your time or money.",1
What about what happen on Saturday 23rd of March DISNEY the whole experience was ruined for my kids an family who had the life scared out of them!!!! Far too many people had been allowed in that park you would need to look at having a limit of number of people instead of thinkin about profit!!!,1
"I dodon't know where to start with this review. Firstly the cost of the tickets on the gate is EUR109 per adult, book online and with Attraction Tix and you'll pay   55 per adult   nearly half price!We arrived around 11am on Saturday 24th March and the ques to even get into the park was a nightmare. On man on a horse trying to direct everyone. You were herded towards and entrance and bags were checked before being herded towards either the Disneyland Paris park or Walt Disney Studio park.Once we were finally into the park we decided to try and head towards the back to go on some rides. We made it onto a small boat ride within 15 minutes which we diddon't think was too bad. We should have gone next door to the little train ride straight away but we walked to Indian ride where we coulddon't go on as little one was one cm too small. By now it was around mid day and after checking the app for wait times   everything was over 45 minutes wait. Some were already 90 minutes. We used the fast pass to get a ticket to return to Hyperspace mountain. We got the ticket around 12.30 and had to return between 3.35   4.05. When we returned we did walk straight on and was on the ride within 10 minutes.Everywhere you went, the lines were huge. To get candy floss we had to line up to purchase a ticket then line up again to collect the candy floss   this took over 30 minutes.The places to eat are all greasy fried food, no where healthy at all. There was also nowhere to fill up your water bottles so you had to line up and pay for a water. In the height of summer this could be very dangerous if you are dehydrated.Big Thunder Mountain was out for most of the day however we saw they were testing it and took a risk by standing in line and thankfully it paid off however we were still queuing for 30  minutes.There is no organisation for the shows and this resulted in a lot of crowding and the kids not being able to see a lot.The biggest issue here is the lack of staff. There was barely anyone around to help.Sadly we were caught up in the issues on Saturday night. We were locked in the restaurant for over three hours with two very scared children. It was disgusting the lack of information being provided and at one point we all had to climb under the tables and shied the children as there was rumours that a gunman was inside. You can not understand how terrifying this is. I have travelled so often and I have never been so scared in my life.I would never return to Disneyland Paris ever again due to everything mentioned in this review. This was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime for our children and it turned in to an absolute nightmare.",1
All the excitement of being at Disney disappeared within the first hour. We left the pram (stroller) by the designated parking and went into see the princess in turn. 1 hour went by and we go out to find out that our pram and all the belongings on it were gone! That   s the magic of Disney disappearing kid strollers?! Reported it and they were so indifferent around us... go to city hall they said which was on the other side. Walked all the way to the entrance and not one security was to be found. Made it to city hall and the lady rolled her eyes and told us    it happens all the time    really?! Even handed us a    stollen pram    report! So Disney doesn   t try to fix a known problem all they do about it is a form with a Mickey logo! Brilliant! They give us the most awkward pram to go around the park. So what?! The rest of the days in Paris our kid is supposed to walk? Great! There were no characters walking around anywhere. The parade was so short. No magic at all in that place. The rides were definitely not worth the 60  minute wait on every line. We were only on 6 rides as we didn   t have time due to all the queuing for hours and hours. Absolutely never going back. If you are going make sure to leave your pram at the hotel and just borrow one of theirs. Watch your bags and wallet as there are known thieves there and they steal what they can and the park knows it but won   t warn you since it   s    the happiest place on earth    happy was the one thing I was not today. Watch your things and bring your lock for the pram.,1
"No magic, no atmosphere, no characters, so many rides shut for renovation, no happiness or cheer, complete waste of money....only good thing to say is that we were lucky with the weather!",1
"I've been to quite a few parks around the world, including Orlando and LA, and I came away from our 5 night Disney stay thoroughly disappointed. I cadon't quite put my finger on why... Maybe it was the queues of 60 90  minutes wait for a mediocre rides (OK the Ratatoulie and twilight tower were good but still not worth the wait). Maybe it was the lacklustre live shows. Maybe it's because you have to make a reservation and queue to get a picture with any character. Maybe it was the over priced and poor quality food and merchandise. We ended up  killing time  in Vapiano restaurant the one place we found the food and coffee to be decent, rather than go back in to the parks. Most of the rides were mediocre at best. I cadon't believe people actually queue 90 mins for a 2 min experience. I would be too frustrated and tired the ride at that stage to even enjoy the ride.I can honestly say that the children under 6 looked to be having more fun playing around the small playground near big thunder than anywhere else in the park. I'm so disappointed in Walt Disney Corp. putting their name to such an inferior product. Then again I know i shoulddon't be as it's just business for them. However I'm more disappointed to read that some people highly rate what is in reality a blatant exercise in screwing Joe public. You get what you pay for does not apply to Disneyland.",1
"My family and I visited Disneyland Paris just before Christmas. Our trip was disastrous! After a frosty welcome by reception staff we were confronted by an Unprepared room, (looked like rock stars had had the room) bloody towels in the bathroom , curtains down, mattresses off beds. Phone disconnected so we could not contact reception. Our room was moved but in the morning the lounge carpet was soaking wet from the shower. After a day in the park we had to move our room again ( we are now in our 3rd room) we had to repack our cases and move late in the evening. We were exhausted. etc etc. Despite numerous attempts by our travel agent to contact Disneyland have been    stonewalled   . We have not received any communication from Disneyland. I am sure they would like to reply before we publish the videos and photos ! ",1
"Having done Disneyland Florida in 1981 as a 6 yr old, the intention was to take our 2 8yr olds before they were too old, to Euro Disney.....to take in the magic.Well, having checked into great accommodation courtesy of Centreparcs Village Nature a 30 bus ride away, we started the first of two days with Disney.Weather doesn   t bother us and we are pretty travel aware having been to many countries. However, the queues in this place were unreal. You expect to wait to get in ...everyone is likely to arrive as it opens etc. Its the rides...on the first day we managed 3 rides between 10am and 5 pm. 3 rides ...of which we queued for one for 2 hours. Normally, we would have just left but the children were there and once you commit to the wait, you are just too angry to leave the queue. That ride lasted 2.16 minutes ! More fool us. Food and drink onsite is costly and most bring their own. There are not loads of places to sit and eat it   most multi task whilst standing in the queues. Most staff were helpful apart from one who would not replace a broken pin badge fastening for my son who had owned it 30 minutes. No replacement fastener or offer of a refund just a non chalant    you buy another    . It   s a badge ffs, just take one off another badge and give us it   however, that staff member was not the norm   most were fine. Disney is obviously a huge enterprise, shops galore, over priced tat mostly unless you are die hard Disney of which we saw many. However, we wanted to do the old fashioned getting autographs of characters, meet characters for photos and there was very little of this. In two days in two parks we found one Goofy...both kids dissapppinted.In fact, far from being a memorable experience, both kids on the second day asked to go back to the village Nature accommodation to use the Centreparcs facilities.If we divided the cost of Disney between the rides we managed to get on (3 on day one, 5 on day two) then we have been sorely wripped off.",1
"So we booked a 2 day 2 park trip to EuroDisney for our Daughters 21st birthday surprise. The tickets we purchased a while ago with ease. However when we got to the park, we found around half the rides closed for maintenance, which meant the queues for the rides that were open were for the most part over 90 mins and in some cases 150 mins. Spending so long standing around meant we also didn   t get to see any parades or shows.I understand the need to maintain these rides but to have so many shut at once really causes issues with wait times across the rest of the parks.We managed 3 rides in the day   5hrs queuing for 6 mins of rides. Needless to say we   re not going to waste our time on using the tickets for day 2 and spend our time in Paris instead. This really put a dampener on what should of been a fantastic surprise for our daughters 21st.Really not value for money and the only memorable part of the day was standing around in a Queue.I know we could of purchased fast pass, but this on top of an already expensive ticket would of broke the bank.Not value for money and certainly no magic!",1
"Overpriced & underjoyed, this is so obvious an exercise in squeezing the lemon that even the jaded staff are unable or unwilling to defend the poor value overpriced model. We felt obliged to do the visit just once for our young kids but we won   t be repeating the long queues, the sour attitudes, & the poor quality.Suffice to say we won   t be back   this is an entertainment model that has sold out to a pure cash extraction exercise  it has had its day!",1
"Paid for a day pass, fortunately is was only a one day pass. Save your money and go to Florida as this place is a very very poor second rated experience. Nothing about this place is worth paying for, rubbish rides, rubbish experience. RIP off",1
"This is my second review about Disappointing Disney The saga goes on, my granddaughter like most little girls dream of meeting princesses in castles, so we booked the very expensive princess lunch, but after the terrible time we had over the last few days with all the queues for everything and not been able to eat because restaurants are so full or fully booked (read my first review) meeting The princesses seemed like a lovely afternoon in the hellhole of Disney. We ordered our lunch and sat in anticipation to wait for the princesses my granddaughter dressed just like the pretty princesses suddenly she then started to feel unwell so we went to bathroom where she started to vomit, we told our waitress to cancel our meal. My granddaughters dreams shattered, her princess dress covered in vomit, all of us distressed to see her distress and again Disney did not disappoint all they wanted was our money for food we did not get to eat!! We did ask them if they were serious as obviously we didn   t eat the food and told them to cancel it but they were serious and made us pay for price for this shattered little girl dream!! Disney the land of trickster! ",1
"Just come back from our nineth visit to DLP. I cadon't see us goign again. Endless break downs on the rides, endless queues on the rides and far too many rides closed for refurbishment! This place is way too busy nowadays. There are not enough attractions any more despite the cost of the trip increasing by around 50% in the last 2 years. It promises so much but gives so little back to visitors. There are always a handful of rides 'closed for refurbishment' and always a couple of rides broken down. This can last between an hour or many hours. The cost of food and drink is also bordering on scandalous. A can of sprite is nearly 4 Euro's and a pint of awful beer now comes in at 7.49 Euro's! A Burger and chips wiehghs in at around 15 Euro's so it's easy to see what kind of costs you're going to come up against. I see absolutely no value in this place any more. It just isdon't worth the money.",1
"Let us start with the good stuff.Park is clean, the parades and firework display are fantastic, so why the 1 rating?Staff attitude. Shocking and disgusting. Rude 90 percent of the time.Disorganised. The rocket ride had three cast members, two going around together slowly and third to press a button. The photo app doesdon't work in the park! The photo opportunities were very linited, for   60 we got 12 photos.Rides breaking down. Five of the limited rides broke down during the ride.Expensive . Our character dinner for adults and a child would have been   210 had we not been on a meal plan. Most all you can eat would have been   80.Children good options. Very limited.Tried contacting them, no response after our visit Avoid !!!!!! ",1
"Disneyland Paris managed a really difficult task: kill the Disney magic. I have been to several Disneyland parks around the world, including California and Japan and Paris is by far the worst. Let   s start with the good points: the park is clean, some staff are really nice, the light show and parades are up to Disneyland standards.Now the bad. First, the poor queue management and the huge waiting time. They advertise for an app but it is not working. All the waiting times shown in the app are wrong and hugely under evaluated, and never update. The staff if not evaluating and refreshing the queuing time on site either. The non working app and the randomly huge queeing time ( 30 min for its a small world! ) makes it really hard to plan your activities.Waiting time and queues are really a problem everywhere in the park. Be prepared to queue at toilets,restaurants, shops, everywhere. For instance, instead of having the Disney caracters walk around the park hugging children, they stay in one place and they make you queue (again) to see them. This is really disappointing for young kids.Would you queue an hour to see Mickey ?All the attractions in Fantasyland close really early at 6 pm. This is because of the lightshow at 7:30 pm  a really nice show, but it makes a really short day.All this would still be ok, provided the staff were all nice. Yes, the worst thing in this park is probably the staff. Not all of them, most of them are nice. However you may encounter some staff shouting at you angrily at any occasion. For instance, when preparing for a parade, instead of telling you nicely where you can cross they will yell at you      No, no     angrily. There is an italian restaurant in Fantasyland where they yelled at me and my 4 y.o. because we wanted to seat while my husband was queuing. A group of exhausted teenager nearby got the same angry yelling. Apparently you don   t have the right to rest and chill, everybody had to queue. When we were watching the parade, a staff member yelled at a nearby young couple trying to stand on a fence to see better. Instead of going there to tell them nicely that they couldn   t stand on the fence, the staff yelled at them angrily from far away, like they did something really bad . It scared all the people around and killed the nice mood of the parade. The random yelling and rudeness, and exhaustion from queues drained our energy. Disneyland Paris should train their staff in anger management and hospitality. They should properly manage their queues and have a functioning app. If you have the luxury to go to another Disneyland, avoid this one.",1
If you go there   buy a fastpass (4x the normal price). Otherwise you will spend literally 85% of time in ques. And our visit was on a weekday in February!!! Cant imagine what its like in higher season.,1
"Hyperion cafe:  Bad customer experience with:  BF: at 10 1130am only provided breads, no other choice, yuck  Lunch at 1130 is long que and allowed systematic que cut   Foods are easily outserved by Mac.",1
"Don   t waist your time! This version of Disneyland is filthy, fading and peeling paint, excessive cigarette smoke even where it   s not permitted, whiplash starts and stops on rides, trash overflowing, no signage in any other languages, horrible food, etc, etc...",1
"Disneyland in the US is said to be the happiest place on earth, and it is. Disneyland Paris is like a knock off franchise that I can only assume is run by someone other than Disney. Where do I start:1. They closed off parts of the park starting at 7PM although the park was  open  until 10PM. Of course, they put up no signage and had not staff to direct patrons, so many people walked into section to find all rides and exits closed and had to wander around to find their way out.2. People were lining up for broken rides, but the staff (standing 5 feet way) weredon't telling anyone that the ride was closed. The growing line caused major traffic jams. 3. We wait an hour for a ride that was then announced as  temporarily closed . It closed with us at the front on the line. Because we were next, we asked how long they expected the ride to be  temporarily  closed. Because it was 3 hours before park close, they told us that they diddon't plan to even try to fix the ride. In other words, not temporary and no interest in fixing it. In all, we probably spent over 2 hours of our day waiting in line for broken down rides or trying to find our way out of closed sections of the park.4. Characters do not walk around the park as they do in the US, but you can stand in line for 90 minutes or more to see a character. We diddon't; we were afraid that when we got to the front of the line, we'd be told the character was broken.5. There's a general lack of variety with the restaurants; restaurant staff aredon't friendly at all; and many restaurants are far too small to provide seating for patrons and there's no public seating nearby. We were in a restaurant were people were fighting for tables, sitting on the floor, etc.6. The kids really wanted popcorn. We waited 20 minutes in a line that wasdon't moving. I realized that it wasdon't moving because their popcorn kiosks are manned by a single worker who both scoops popcorn (without gloves) using the same hands that take money and dispense change. I told the kids that they may as well go around and lick the hands of everyone in the part, if they're going to eat that dirty popcorn. Rack up another wasted 20 minutes standing in line. 7. And just to top it all off, when we finally left, it was impossible to find the exit. They woulddon't let us out the gates, we had to walk through a shop. Then some jerk employee was blocking the entrance to the train station and told us to walk around some gate while others were going straight through.Disney really needs to cut this bad franchise loose as it sullies their name. They need to send the  Undercover Boss  to this place to see how bad it is.",1
"I would like to share my very disappointing experience at Disneyland Paris .From a young child I had always wanted to go to Disney ,to experience the magic , to meet the characters etc .So I saved to take my youngest daughter for her 10th birthday as you can imagine she was so excited .Early Saturday morning we set off from home with expectations of a truly wonderous experience ahead of us .Sadly that is not what we experienced ,as a mother whose child   s only birthday present was to go to Disneyland Paris I felt so very disappointed and sad for my little girl who was left absolutely heart broken .My parents who live in Cyprus travelled to the UK to be able to share this experience with their Granddaughter ,so this was not a cheap undertaking on our behalf and we did at least expect some value for money .So we all bought fast passes to allow us to get on the rides with a minimum wait time as my father has trouble standing for long periods and we had a Drs letter to back this up . However when we tried to use the fastpass there was no rides available until 17.00hrs which meant we were unable to go on any rides for over a 4 hour wait . There was a whole variety of rides closed which meant the ones that were working had over 1.5hr queues as all the people were concentrated on the rides that did work if you queued as there was no Fastpass available . Things closed even ran to basics like restaurants and toilets , trying to get lunch took over an hour queuing and the chose of places to eat limited in the park .All the adverts advertising Disney show the characters wandering around and interacting with the children , there was none of this which I feel is a misrepresentation of what you are actually purchasing, after all you are purchasing the Disney experience not just a theme park with rides. I do not need to travel to France to go to one of those .I did see two meet and greets with Donald and Pluto however we went to see Mickey mouse but he was not too be found . We did see Cinderella however, she rushed past not speaking to any one , was clearly in a hurry and it was not even midnight .We ended up leaving the park with an absolutely sobbing young girl whose magical dreams had been so badly broken . My Daughter Charlotte did not get to go on any rides , she didn   t get to see any of the characters other that what I have explained above ,and her dreams of Disneyland are shattered .My husband has been to Disneyland Florida and although there are queues , which are to be expected we realise that .His experience was so much better , parades 3 x a day ,characters available to meet and pictures that can be taken , rides working and so on .This new fastpass system of being able to book your rides in advance needs addressing as it clearly isn   t working for everyone or people with a day ticket .I feel that I should share this absolutely terrible experience as I would hate for other children to go through what my little girl did . This experience happened on Saturday 12 1 2019 . It also appears to me that you ONLY get the Disney experience if you stay in the Disney hotels ,otherwise no one appears to care that you are not getting what you pay for , this is something I also think should be made very clear from the start .Disney is a brand after all that is only as good as the people who are buying in to the magical dream , buying the merchandise ,going to the films. We the people who do that, should at least get the experience that we have paid for .Its like if you went to a Jeweller and paid for a diamond and was given coal .This is all such a great shame as so many people hold Disney on such a pedestal .I also have sent my complaint to Disneyland Paris guest relations on the 14 1 2019 ,i am yet to recieve a reply or acknowlegedement of my email .I would not recommend this park .",1
"Disney Land Paris is a Dirty place , the management there closed more than half the attractions for   renovations   they advertise that the close at 8:00 pm , however , they closed the fantasy land 2 hours earlier   in preparation for the fireworks   all while still charging full tickets and fast passes prices , staff are poorly trained ... ",1
"Visited Disney 2 days 2 parks and very disappointed with Disney experience. I had read up before hand that some attractions were closed for refurbishment but to be there and find things that were supposed to be open cancelled and temporarily closed was unacceptable. Staff were extremely rude and not feeling the Disney magic at all, in fact they all looked miserable. All in all it was a very unforgettable trip (but in a bad way) and a very expensive one at that too! I have emailed Disney itself with no reply it   s very unprofessional. Disneyland Paris does not live up to the Disney trademark it sells.",1
"I could write rather a long review with regards to DLP about all the negative things we had to contend with over the Christmas and New Year, but the one thing I wanted to advise was if any of you are thinking booking direct with Disney.....DONT! We had several problems during our stay and since returning home, I have put together a e mail of discontent and sent it to Disney guest services.I had a receipt saying that my e mail would be answered within a 15 day period, that was 28 days ago. I sent another asking for a reply and then received a e mail from another department saying that I   d sent it to the wrong e mail address. They informed me that they had forwarded it and I again forwarded my original mail to the new address. To date I still have received no correspondence.The moral of the story is book through a travel agent, because if anything goes wrong, you have someone on your side to pursue it for you.Disney   all I can say to you is....you are money driven and your guest relations department is a lot to be desired!",1
"After having a wonderful time 20 years ago in Disney Anaheim, our expectations were admittedly high. I am bitterly disappointed with Disneyland Paris. It is overpriced, overcrowded (do they even think about limiting numbers in busy periods? After spending over $1500 for tickets for the 5 of us, I had to spend an additional $1500 for one day of fastpass just to ensure we got ANY value from the parks. The food is overpriced rubbish, and (here I go again as an Aussie coffee snob) the coffee was atrocious. The limitations they place on the tickets and the outrageous queues (120 minutes was the max we saw on our days there in early Jan) mean it is almost impossible to get the full value from your ticket. There are so many other great options for things to do in Paris please dodon't waste your money like we did. Additionally, because of the additional expense of the food and fastpass we felt compelled to buy, our kids left with no Disney merchandise (partly due to the price and partly on principle). All I can conclude is that it has all been downhill for Disney in the past 20 years, or that Paris is a shadow of the Anaheim version. Finally, the park has a no smoking policy which is absolutely ignored by many of the visitors and is not enforced by the staff. This is supposed to be the  happiest place on earth , not a vector for lung cancer in children.My advice, if you MUST go:1. Take your own food and drink2. Buy a fastpass. Total rip off but your tickets are worthless otherwise You are paying to queue.3. Get there early   it almost always opens earlier than the posted time, in our experience.4. Carefully examine the Ts and Cs on your tickets   multi day tickets in our case had to be used with a defined week period, which restricted our flexibility enormously.",1
"It seems Disneyland Paris is going downhill fast. It was our fifth visit to the park and it's going to be our last, the only magic you have now is how much money they try to squeeze out of you which woulddon't be such a bother if the entrance fee wasdon't 100     per day.It looks all dated and in need of refurbishment which also takes a lot magic away. We were there over the weekend in januari so not the busiest time of the year but waiting times for the popular attractions were well over a hour with a peak of 180minutes for ratatouille. Instead of doing something about it Disney decided to make special fastpasses called super and ultimate fastpasses ofcourse against a hefty price starting from 30    day for 3 attraction (so 10    attraction) to 150    per day per person for all attractions.We ate at the Agrabah Caf  , for the 3rd time and my god has the quality gone down. Seems like budget cuts everywhere but prices go up. With still an hour to go into the service they weredon't happy to keep the buffet stocked. Food itself was barely warm.In general the staff doesdon't seem happy anymore to work for Disney and do the bare minimum which results in long waiting lines and waiting times. Organisation is not what it should be and that's the fault of managment. I can imaging if you are a first time visitor you are still impressed enough to miss such things but we can compare it to how it was 10 years ago and it has gone downhill and it's going downhill faster. I hope the promised investments will pay of but I suspect it will only mean everything will be even more expensive.",1
Too bloody expensive.    107 ticket for a day ticket. Queues of 2 hours for buzz lightyear. Other rides also more than an hour. Must be a french thing. No Disney figu,1
"What a dump this place is. From the disgusting toilets, to the other visitors just smoking wherever they like. The characters are not wandering around the park like the adverts show. You have to queue for 90mins for a photo. Buzz Lightyear (or the teenager exploited in the costume) woulddon't even wave at my 3 year old son . The Disney magic may exist in America but in Europe it is dead due to the lazy attitude of the staff. My son and daughter were nearly crushed as hundred on people queue on the bridge to take photos of some fountains... the staff diddon't care. Dodon't waste your money. Thomas land at Dayton manner is loads better value.",1
"My 17 year old had never been to Disneyland (I have been to the America and Japanese parks several times) and we were massively disappointed. Staff had none of the friendly, magical happy disposition of other parks. They were bored and totally disinterested in their clients. Eleven attractions were closed it disrupted and the place was filthy with people smoking everywhere and nothing cleaned. Here is some photos if the theatre we sat in that looked like a pig stie. Give this a miss and spend your hundreds of euros elsewhere. ",1
"An honest review of the park   We spent about 5 minutes of a 9 hour day actually on rides and the rest waiting in lines. I don   t think the park should be letting in that many people, if they can   t accomodate those already in the park. We visited on the 27th December and it was a really cold, overcast day. The park was absolutely packed. There were lines for everything. I know this is typically, but this was honestly excessive. I wouldn   t recommend visiting as it   s not worth the money. I   m a hugggeee Disney fan, but I   d much rather visit the parks in America. Also majority of lines were outside in the freezing cold with no outdoor heating or anything to keep people warm in freezing conditions.",1
Where to start? we paid my daughter and i just under 200    to access one park  they made 2 of them so you can pay more!  i asked to purchase a fast track they say they did not have it on that day just another lie among so many. the shops are everywhere 5 to 10 times the price outside. for each attraction you wait at least 90 minutes for a ride that lasts 3 minutes.now if that is not running a scam i dodon't know what is. i thought i was riding back in the early 70's the decor so poor old dolls soundtrack just as bad. my 8 year old daughter told me this cannot be Disney! Yes Disneyland Paris.visiting a factory would be 10 times more interesting. the staff are so rude and not interested at all. you queue for everything: restaurants shops toilets absolutely horrible. if you were to pay me i would not go there again. my kid so frustrated and annoyed for what was a huge expectation... this place should be closed down that's how good it was.si j'ai un conseil a vous donnez n'y allez pas avec vos enfants. une perte de temps d'argent les attractions sont plus que nuls. c'est de l'arnaque du vol...une honte,1
"We went to Disneyland Paris on the 18th December with two young children and my parents for a break away before Christmas.The flight there was an    experience    flying with bmi (who we never flew with before) we had the tiniest plane that experienced severe turbulence on take off which scared the hell out of us but got us to our destination quickly and (more importantly)safely.I was advised on booking transfers with always shuttle but they failed to show up at the airport (luckily I had planned to pay driver on arrival so didn   t get charged). We then found a driver who managed to get 4adults,2 children and all our luggage in his normal size estate car which was such a squeeze! It then took us 1.30hours to get to the hotel Cheyenne which we were quoted 80    at first but ended up costing us 125    due to traffic!We arrived at the hotel Cheyenne at approx 11am where I was    welcomed    by a hotel receptionist who just gave me some cards with our names on and a flyer for the park.She didn   t didn   t explain that these cards were to be used for food and getting into the park. We were then told that we couldn   t get in our room till 3pm so we left our luggage in the luggage room and jumped on the shuttle bus to the the park which literally took 5minutes.After a stressful morning we happened to catch the Christmas parade in all its full glory!Food at the park I booked the premium food package before we went and booked all the places we wanted to go.If we didn   t do this the food in the park was ridiculously expensive especially in the silver spur where it would have cost us 280    for 2 adult and a child   s meal!The food was amazing especially enjoyed Walt   s,silver spur and the character tea in inventions! Book your reservations before you leave as so many families we spoke to didn   t have anywhere to go to eat!Buffalo bills is a must see! I don   t like horses but absolutely loved this show!even my 20month old sat and watched the whole thing!Dont forget your beers are free when your having your meal.Shuttle bus this was fine in the mornings but the park shut at 6.30 on the Wednesday and Thursday nights which was hell! We literally had to fight to get the buggy   s on to the bus no one would move especially the locals!The rides are amazing but aren   t as many as I would have thought there would be. I was also shocked how many my youngest (20months) could go on.The characters you must download the lineberty app before you go to the studios as you will not get chance to see any of the characters.This gives you a ticket to come back and visit but you only get one per person!Workers the workers at Disney mainly on the main entrances spoiled our whole Disney welcoming experience they were rude, miserable and just didn   t want to work there!Totally different to the workers in Florida and Disney cruise!We were shouted at to show our tickets,told to move out the way abruptly and generally disrespected which really upset me! I have vowed that I would never go back due to the sheer lack of respect! I would rather save hard and go to Florida and get the    whole    Disney experience rather than just a taste! ",1
"I remembered going to Disney when I was younger so thought it would be a great idea to treat my family to a world class theme park holiday.Let   s start with the Eurostar; I booked premier class and it was a great train that was very modern. The downside was no hostess service, Wi fi was appalling and the meal consisted of a piece of bread and a croissant. No Joke!The Disney express service was superb and worked really well enabling us to get straight into the park when we arrived which was great.Entry into the park was fine but the signage was awful. Trying to find how to get around with out a map is impossible. People walk around smoking or vaping everywhere in the park to the extent where I feel like I have become a smoker. A resort that is for children and allows people to smoke freely which basically sends the message to kids that it   s ok to smoke is appalling.Trying to get food is ridiculous at the fast food joints. You would think that they would be ahead of McDonalds with the digitised menu but no, old school queues and no where to sit. Price 3 times more than McDonalds or and the quality is 3 times as poor.Queuing for rides is also a joke, they need to let less people in. Queuing for over 2 hours to get on rides is a joke in this day and age.Next is your hotel, we stayed at Newport bay and check in was poor, I wasn   t asked about having extras on my room so when I ordered from the bar I couldn   t charge to to my room. It took the person at reception 10 minutes to sort this out. The alcohol is a rip off,   8 for a pint and   16 for a large glass of wine and that was house. Sancerre will cost you   22.We upgraded to the compass club and breakfast was good as well as the hot drinks and cold drinks in the fridge. But unless your kids like pop there are no bottles of water in the fridges to take with you. The food in the evening is also poor, there are miniature sandwiches filled with various pastes. They can   t even afford or be bothered to to put some meat in the sandwiches or serve some hot food. Again another poor value for money experience.The restaurants in the park serve good food but it is over priced. I had a steak which cost   35 and it was so small I eat in 3 bites. The kids menus are poor in all the restaurants we went too which was captain jacks and the silver spur. I wish we had just eaten at McDonald   s or earl of sandwiches. Both are well priced and you don   t feel like you have had your pants taken down.The Disney photo plus app is also good in principal but again downloading the photos is hit and miss and we lost loads. Great idea though if it works 100% of the time.Character breakfast,   113 to queue up for a buffet, spend 10 minutes queuing for a coffee and get 6 pictures. For that kind of money I expect a character to at least sit with us and to get someone to serve my coffee.We also noticed that a lot of things looked worn out. For example lighting McQueen car had all the stickers peeling of it, a drinks vendor had a cabinet with fake ice cubes in it and green algae was growing up the side of it.Lastly the train in the way back was terrible, ripped seats, no Wi fi, didn   t take card as payment and the meal was a slice of quiche. Awful, again why can   t you at least give people a sandwich.Overall a poor experience and a waste of money. Not what I remember from my days as a kid at Disneyland Florida. I remember there being characters everywhere, you didn   t need to queue up to meet them. The staff where really friendly and helpful. There were lots of vendors selling meat on the bone or french fries etc. Here you just got someone selling you a small cinema popcorn for   7.I will never go again or recommend anyone go unless they don   t care about money and love Disney.

"I   ve been to Disneyworld Florida numerous times and it   s always impeccable, unfortunately it   s French sibling does not live up to expectations. We were there 28 12 18.Disney cast members are supposed to be enthusiastic and helpful and in Paris, they are not. The queues everywhere were unreal. To get just a hot dog we waited at least 30 mins. There were 4 staff yet only serving one customer at a time. By the time we got served after waiting in the freezing cold we were almost icicles. There was 1 staff member heating the hot dogs, one making coffee hot chocolate, one standing about laughing with the other who may have put out some ketchup. Big thunder mountain was running empty yet the queue was massive. All rides were at least 90 mins wait and 120 mins for the princess cove. I know the temperature is not the responsibility of Disney but it was soooo cold but you couldn   t even get into a restaurant to get some food and a heat. We had to try and get into a shop but they were so busy you could barely move with people just barging into you. I sat on one of the stone benches to watch a show at the castle but after about 5 mins I had to get up as it was so cold to sit on it was painful. They could use some outdoor heaters and seating areas. If I wanted to go to Disney I would rather save longer and go to Florida because Paris is a disappointment. Definitely don   t go in winter as it   s too cold. There are some nice sites and good shows but sadly didn   t enjoy it as much due to crowds and cold. ",1
They know they cannot service the amount of people they let in. Yet they look ack them in . 2 hours 1 ride wait. 1hr another. 45min to get food 25 minutes toilet. Your lucky to get 3 rides in for the day. They charge a lot more for an Express ticket. Seriously it's not a place to visit.. to give the kids some fun we went to parks with little wait...but they could have had the same fun at the local park.,1
"This was a terrible visit to Disneyland Paris, maybe it was our timing over the Christmas but it was the visit from hell. 90 120 min waits for most rides (which if you have small children Is Impossible )... I decided to try warm up the baby in a cafe or restaurant (temperature was 1 degree C) .... 60 minute queue for a seat !.. staff were extremely unhelpful when I asked where I could get food for a hungry 2 year old and basically said it   s busy we can   t help . Surely Disney must know the capacity of entrants that the park is capable of handling while still allowing everyone to access rides and food, and somewhere to warm up?It is a false economy as I saw countless families with upset children leave throughout the day in frustration .... bad business Disney , worst    400 I have ever spent. My recommendation is , save yourself the trip out here and spend it on a nice meal and tour of Paris ",1
"Of course; Disney is a must see, and with Christmas is the decoration very nice and magic. But... much to much people for much to less good atractions. We waited and waited and waited...; and saw much to less. Dramatic long waiting queues, mostly over 1 hour, in the cold rain...fronzen all over on this 24th of december... The most stupid    american thing    is the ridiculous fasspasses; when you wait, you wait extra longer because of lots of people who pay extra for the fastpass. It is a real unfair moneymaker.When you want to go; Please book your parking and entrancetickets online, we didn   t and had to pay wet 45(!) euro extra (with 4 persons): ridiculous!!We where in the park for 10 hours, and where able to visit only 8 atractions and the parade...Be warned for this real moneytrap!",1
"Weekend queues can go as long as 120min, believe it or not. Fast pass need to wait for 5h! With so many people and some sitting on the floor at casey corner to eat their hotdogs for dinner, you can find their restaurant Pizzeria Bella Notte closing at 6.30pm.! What lousy service. We understand the park is supposed to be magical at night but when night falls, the place was not well lit and pose risks for children, elderly and the disabled. The parades had shorter duration compared to other disney parks and totally underwhelming.Paid one of the most expensive disney tickets,   69 per person, but did not get the value. Tokyo disney was much cheaper but so much better in terms of service and experience.Would not return again.",1
"overpriced and overrated, hardly any attractions and full of shops that sell the same goods ( at least twice the cost of goods in the UK )long waits everywhere ",1
"We were disappointed. I bought tickets for two parks, but due that lots of rides where out of order or that have aged a lot, I thought it was not worth it. Maybe it would be better to go there in the summer when there is more going on or to put it different where there are more options available and the staff isdon't off. We encountered several food stalls, that were out of salty food (hamburger french fries) by 13:00 (1 pm!). So we went into the big eating   souvenir hall and the people were sitting on the floor, as there was not enough place to sit outside inside to have once's lunch?!? I was amazed what I saw there. Also some registers where closed and the lines where really really long just to get food.I dodon't get it, why not limit the amount of people if the park cannot provide enough food or places to sit?",1
"I took my family to Disneyland Paris for two days... I was told as a disabled person I could secure a 10% discount for myself, a free carer ticket and the children would be full price and we would get queue assistance. All this seemed very fair and generous but I was told we would need to buy the tickets at the park to secure this discount and access card. When I asked how to buy the tickets they said we needed to go to the Donald Desk on arrival! I suggest this should be re named the 'Donald Desk of Doom!' Pre trip I asked if I could reserve a chair for the day    No sorry, all our chairs are on a first come first served basis.  (was the response!) I coulddon't take this risk so we bought one in a charity shop and took it with us. On the day we arrived at the Donald Desk, queued for 30 mins only to be told we were in the wrong queue! Apparently, we were in the service queue NOT the disabled queue! We then queued for another 30 mins in another queue which we were told was the right queue... only to be told they could not sell us the actual tickets only provide the access pass and we would need to join another queue to buy our tickets! There were only three queues to choose from all with 100's waiting,..... there were 20 desks unstaffed, we had to queue at one of the three desks for a further hour to buy 400 Euro's worth of tickets... we had arrived at the park at 10am .... if the signage had been better and the staff more helpful we could of started in the right queue... my children were in tears.... my son called it the queue of doom and said lets just go to lego land next time mummy.... There were families with autistic kids who diddon't understand why we were not being allowed in the park... it was a truly miserable experience for everyone ...Once we were in the park the system worked well but the purchasing of the tickets was rude, disorganised and ridiculous.... We arrived at the park at 10 and diddon't get on a ride until 12.15.... that's utterly crazy.... They should allow disabled guests to pre purchase tickets to reduce the wait or open more desks at busy times.",1
"Maybe going to Disneyworld Florida made it harder to enjoy this park because that trip was so magical...but it just wasdon't anywhere near in the same league.The staff were rude and unhelpful, we were in the queue for a ride and actually saw a staff member barge past someone infront...in Florida it's like they're on stage and never stop acting to keep the magic alive.The queue times were ridiculous, we got on 4 rides in 12 hours and 1 of those was a fast pass. We queued 1hr10 for Peter Pan for it to break down when we were 10 mins to the front, about 45 mins later they then told everyone they were closing it for maintenance. No fastpasses were given out, we just got shooed off.The castle illuminations were great and the only one magical thing about the day.",1
well i dont know where to start dis eyla d paris all you do is queue queue queue and even though my little girl had been waiting for two HOURS to vet on peter pan ride my friends daughter needed the loo so she left my dauvhter in the queue while they were at the loo my daughter had reached the front so she let other people on when my friend returned they were told they had to queue again i was furious when they came back it was cold aswell my little girl was very upset so in two days at disneyland paris she only went on 1 ride an absolute disgrace we had a package deal where could enter the park early 8.30 only to find tbat nearly all the rides didnt open until 10 what a rip off very very very busy i dont think they monitor the amount of people going into the park at all the fireworks were amazing even though i do think 10pm is a little late for younger kids the parade was magical aswell. would i go there again definately not a complete waste of money and staff are so so so rude,1
"Okay, so we made the mistake of going at a peak time, over the Toussaint school holiday break, and that is on us. But I really don   t think our experience would be all that different with smaller crowds at an off peak time. The place is just poorly thought out, under staffed, and not well managed. In face of the disappointments of the day that just kept coming, my husband and I remained upbeat, trying to make the best of it especially for my son   s sake. He is only seven years old and this was his first time to a Disneyland. But it was a hot mess. After ten hours and 230 euros, we got ride two rides and found it nearly impossible to find any food to buy while we were there.Luckily, we are living in Paris right now so we didn   t waste a precious day of some shorter vacation in France on this. But there are so many better options for spending a day with your kids in the Paris region. Please heed my advice and that of others here and don   t waste a day of your life, a wad of money, and your time on this depressing place. After we arrived, it took at least twenty minutes to clear security.We pre purchased and printed our tickets (230 euro for two adults, one kid). Like at security, the park entrance wasn   t so much comprised of    lines    as much as five or so sites of chaotic masses of densely packed people. With no other info, we finally joined a very, very long line, that seemed more orderly that the crush of humanity elsewhere. We were unsure we were in the correct line with the kind of tickets we had. Everyone around us was equally confused. It was chaos. There was ONE poor flustered employee, working this entrance doing the best he could...trying to process the endless line through the high gate and turnstiles, while also having to try to answer people coming up and shouting questions at him over these barriers trying to find out if they were in the right line. If that wasn   t enough, this guy also had to leave his post frequently to let disabled park goers in through another gate some distance away. While we were waiting to enter the park numerous disputes broke out over people line jumping, which was rampant. Some of these interfaces verged on out and out brawls. It took over 40 minutes to get into the park via that line. Once inside, we saw another massive line at the    City Hall    the    customer service    spot which is also the site where disabled visitors get the passes allowing them special access they need to the rides. It is really sad to see disabled adults and children, many of them in wheelchairs, waiting outside in the cold, no doubt for over an hour or more. The lines for rides were a lot more sedate than the crush outside, but even longer. They all clocked in around 1.5 or 2 plus hours wait per ride. We heard people with FastPasses complaining of slots not being available and long wait times as well. We spent our day in lines and only got to go on TWO RIDES ALL DAY LONG. The Disney app which is supposed to help you navigate the park and get updates for wait times for rides was worthless and 9 times out of ten did not respond or post any wait times at all.Food is another huge problem. It is close to impossible to buy it, even if you are totally willing and ready to pay inflated amusement park prices. Any food purchase involved negotiating massive chaotic    lines    and hour long or more waits. Several restaurants, inexplicably, were closed completely. There are not enough    fast    food outlets in the park, not even for low volume days. After standing in another chaotic line FOR OVER AN HOUR from 2pm to 3pm, I finally purchased 3 plain hotdogs, 3 fountain drinks, and 2 fries for 46 euros.  The employees at the food places really were doing the best they could. They were professional, cordial, and working as fast as they could in the face of endless, daunting lines and frustrated, hungry, sometimes even angry clients. Clearly behind their strained cheery smiles they were miserable, and who wouldn   t be? It was really depressing. I felt bad for them, and upset that I had given money to a company that treats both its customers and employees this way. Stores selling overpriced Disney merchandise, however, can be found throughout the park and, while crowded, are staffed so that visitors can make purchases. I guess selling merchandise makes Disney more money than providing park goers with something (anything) to eat. If you do go, pack your own food, everything your family will need to make it through the day. There is clearly something really wrong with Disney corporate culture that things have sunk this low. My husband and I had been talking about about making a trip to one of the US Disneyland parks, complete with a stay in one of their one site hotels or maybe even taking a Disney cruise. A trip to Disney has been such a rite of passage in the past. But after this experience, anything Disney related, anywhere in the world (my husband and I for once are in complete agreement) is off the table.On our ride back home, my son told us he had an    ok    time (I think he didn   t want us to feel bad knowing what we   d done to get there), but he also said that he didn   t really want to go back to any Disneyland again. It is only an amusement park, after all, and our crummy day there isn   t a tragedy or the end of the world, but I do feel the same way as my son. We won   t be back.",1
"Disney is a ripp off. Very bad food for astronomic price. I dodon't know if it was a special day on 4th of November (Friday), but I never saw so many people cuing for everything food, toilet and 120 min for a simple ride. I know once every kid dream to go to Disney park. I did it and will never do it again. Its just over priced, over growded and low quality starting from the food, old attractions and just long waiting. Making another rip off is taking additional money to get a fast pass to skip the lines of people. For me personal I am disappointed how a company like disney can ripp off parents and kids with this park. If you have an alternative diddon't go, go to Europark, just another quality and more to do and see.",1
"After looking forward to my trip to Disney for months I am extremely saddened to say how disappointed I was in my visit today. We arrived not long after opening time to what I can only describe as chaos. The queues to get in were were so unorganised and never ending and unfortunately that was the story of the full trip. We were there 8 hours and only managed 2 attractions (which weren   t even    must see,    ones. Some rides were    150 min,    wait times which is just insane when they only last a few mins each. There is no sign posts, the map is very difficult to use and despite there being an app, due to the amount of people there the 4G doesn   t work and is therefore, pointless. We were so hungry and thirsty as even the queue for refreshments were 45 mins minimum   we had to leave the park and go to the other end of the village for food and drinks. 30,000 steps later and so upset to say I still don   t really know that    Disney,    is like as after paying    200 I didn   t manage to experience it. I would recommend some vending machines, much more staff to help give instructions and answer guest Qs, more security for incidents, some sort of English translation (I fully appreciate the staff speak in French as their first language but with so many multi national tourists there should be translations especially for safety rules and instructions!) and the fast pass rules need to be changed   this does not work at all ... we bought a fast pass and by 12pm we couldn   t use it as apparently the fast pass was fully booked for the day despite the fast pass lane being empty all day   extremely silly and confusing. To add some positives the park was very clean and beautiful   it certainly has a lot of potential and is visually stunning but so many changes are required to make this a magical visit and I hope the reviews are taken on board to make this happen! ",1
"We arrived at Disney full of excitement and anticipation, however this quickly goes and then the true horror reveals it self! (Halloween on us being the joke) Queues queues queues queues queues, packed solid couldn   t even walk down Main Street without being quashed and shoved. 2hrs wait for rides, meeting characters and the horror goes on... we had to wait in line for 1.5 hour for any type of food, I felt so sorry for staff they got the direct complaints from customers. The hotel Santa Fe was badly disorganised but there was one glimmer of hope was the food in hotel was good lots of choice! I would not recommend Disney to anyone!!!",1
"The worst experience what we ever had with kids! Overcrowded and messed place! Staff is unprofessional and lazy. We spent all day staying in the lines with FastPass. Highly not recommend you to visit the park: it   s not the kingdom of magic, it   s kingdom of awfulness and mess! ",1
" We went on the 1st of November and it was a completely frustrating experience, we felt unwelcome all the time. The Disneyland park in Paris seems to be seeking its end. Exhausting long queues announced as of minimum 45 60 minutes up to 2 hours and more, often became longer once you were trapped in it. Once in a queue there is no way to go to the toilet, drink water or seat anywhere. Awful. Staff is generally unfriendly, unhelpful, apparently poorly trained and unable to provide any basic information. They usualle wear cheap uniforms and are hard to find around the park when you need them. You can guess their work conditions must be horrible as they all look sad and unhappy. Not the best atmosphere for am amusement park. Also, there is no recognizable security staff. If you miss your child, you can better die there in a panic attack. And, hey! Forgot about meeting any of the Disney characters while you walk. You (or your children) wodon't hardly found one in flesh and bones. They could better hire a few actors to have them play Disney characters and have them walking across the streets while you are desesperate in a 2 hours long queue, for instance. On top of this, be prepared to be isolate from the rest of the world. Phones wodon't work: we tried every provider available and all looked blocked or saturated by too many users. The wifi wodon't work neither. Therefore, the Disneyland app is useless. And good luck if you lose one of your peers! If you think that this bad experience does not come for free, but you have to pay for it, then I am sure you will find better places where you spend your money in ",1
"This place has only got worse in the past five years since our last visit and we won   t be going back. Horrific queues for everything, food is tasteless and extremely overpriced ( bring your own from the stores outside) and the staff we encountered are at best simply moronic and devoid of personalities......specifically the ability to share any information with you. The shows and parades are cancelled at short notice due to a spot of rain (light shower) and the best rides seem to have their seats half full on every rotation due to    technical issues   . Disney pull your finger out as your US parks aren   t like this and are staffed by people who actually look like they want to be there rather than suffering it to earn a living  having nothing else available work wise. So disappointing. ",1
"Horrible. 50 minutes waiting in 8 degree weather for any ride that is not like a one of those toddlers play things in a shopping mall. You end up waiting 40 minutes for even the stupid train that goes round the park in snails pace. In efficient and untrained staff. Badly managed, dirty rest rooms. Been to most of Disney parks, this is probably the worst.",1
"We went to disneyland paris for the day during the half term, i took my children and foster children. It was my foster childrens first holiday, and they were so excited i was taking them to disney. We arrived at 10am to get in a full day, but we were shocked at the amount of people in the park. Every ride had a 60 90 minute queue, we had to queue 15 20 mins just for the toilets, i missed the show at lunchtime having to wait 50 mins for some tastless burgers, which at 59 euros was a complete rip off. We managed 6 rides all day, and left the park at 7.45 pm with very tearful children. Disneyland charged us   356 for our 6 tickets, totally disgusting, that they put up there prices for half term and let that many people in. The magic has totally gone and its about how much they can squeeze the orange. Well you will not see me or my children again, shame on you.",1
Just finished 2.5 days at Disneyland Paris and was very disappointed. The prices are shockingly high the wait times for rides was ridiculous. All the big rides had more than 60 minutes of waiting. To me this trip solidified that Disney only cares about the bottom line as they clearly had too many people in the park and were unable to accommodate. I am actually ok with the high prices as I honestly expected to pay extra for the experience. What is unacceptable is the waiting for everything..as other guests mentioned you literally cue for everything. The only way to see everything is to stay for an entire week because you will literally be in line the entire time. Seems like numbers through the door are far more important than quality of experience. We are done with Disney. ,1
Received Eurostar tickets today and seat numbers after looking at the train plan to discover that their are only disabled toilets in first class coach   s 9 and 10 we have been put in coach 15 with no disabled toilets . We made Disney aware when booking that their is a disabled passenger traveling in the party and were not told that their are only disabled toilets in first class if we had we would have upgraded at the time . But now Disney have said to upgrade we would have to pay a cancellation fee and rebook at today   s prices which is significantly more than when we booked just so she can access the toilets which is a basic human right . As for Euro star they are unable to help as the booking is though Disney not them .All they can do is let the driver know so he can check on us . I am amazed that nobody has had this happen to them and that disabled toilets would only be in first class . Our only option now is to wait and see if we can upgrade on the day at the station . Really disappointed as this is meant to be a treat for my daughter 18th birthday and wanted it to all go smoothly. SHAME ON YOU DISNEY LAND,1
It's really expensive. All the decent rides had over an hour queue. To see the princesses was over 2 hours. Most of the rides you could go on at your local fair. 20 min queue to get a hot chocolate. It's not fair on the kids. Dodon't sell as many tickets rather than have them queue for so long for each ride. Its unfair. You can buy a  fast past  which gives you access to three rides (one ride on each) for    45 per person on top of your ticket entry price. So for a family of 4 it's    60 per ride on top of entry ticket....I wish I was allowed to swear. ,1
"Wasted half our first day waiting to get annual passes. No staff on the kiosks. Spending a lot of money on an annual pass with 4 children, needs to better and quicker process in place!",1
"Honestly, I   m disappointed. Came with my 6yo to show her amazing and exiting world of the Disney. We didn   t visit most of the attractions because waiting time was more than one hour!!! Princess encounter   75 mins, Peter Pan flight   75 mins, story of Pinocchio   40 mins etc. Too many people!!! Too many rude people! The parade was great but I don   t understand why Disney will not allow an access for children and people with disabilities to stay in a first row and see it? Instead, my 6yo couldn   t get an access to see the parade because a group of bearded men (fans of frozen perhaps?) were standing in the first row! Really don   t know how families with smaller kids can have a good experience. I   ve visited a Disney land in Orlando 10 years ago and it was completely different experience. Food was horrible but I believe it   s just normality for all the parks. ",1
"If you have been to the other Disney properties in the United States, you dodon't need to bother going here.The park was not well maintained. A couple of the rides that were looking forward to going on were closed. There was overflowing trash cans and dirty bathrooms.Food service was very slow and the quality was mediocre. We were pretty disappointed with our experience and upset that we wasted a day of travel to go visit.",1
"Absolutely shocked to find spin arrival that they have changed the full board package! It no longer means you can eat breakfast in your hotel. It means you have to drag hungry children into the park to the fast food joint where they can have a juice and a croissant! As if my three or 7 year old would eat that. Absolutely disgusted! You pay thousands of pounds to come to what they say is a four star hotel to not even get a breakfast! I can eat in the hotel mind you, if I pay for it!!!! Disney you have let us down massively! This is an absolute rip off!!! Two years ago we got more choice of restaurants with the full board, an afternoon snack and coffee. Now literally nothing. Which I   m sure when I go down to book a returnable I will be told is fully booked. Not impressed. Oh and to add your manager in hotel New York. Rude!! Being told the fast food breakfast is a gift from Disney so I shouldn   t be complaining! I don   t call paying   thousands a fing gift!!!!!",1
"Disney customer service, quality and expectation has declined drastically. We were treated appallingly. Do not expect the same level of service disney once offered. We have spent many holidays over the years even the millennium and this year all our hopes and dreams and previous memories were shattered. Beware of security staff if you ever think of attending electro land my daughter and partner were forcibly removed without any explanation and were told after when we put in a complaint that they were disruptive and causing a disturbance which was completely untrue. We asked for cctv evidence and this was refused!! Disney failed to even give us any explanation and stood by their heavy handed unscrupulous security staff. Please please be aware and think twice before attending this festival in a place where you would think would be a safe friendly environment. They have even surreptitiously shut down on all communication blocking my daughter in her attempts to get this resolved via email, and social media.",1
"We were in the Park 2 days and we spent most of the time in the queue, despite the fact we had priority tickets! Queue to get in, queue to eat, queue to buy a drink, queue to buy ice cream and priority tickets dodon't give you an advantage on majority attractions, hence more queues! Priority tickets are advertised as having 'extra magic time', which means you can enter the park earlier in the morning, but I am not sure what is the point as we went straight away to Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, but it was closed until Part opens for everyone else and we could not print the priority tickets before that time either. Also it seems that if you hold one priority ticket for a ride which you can go on in 3h you cannot print another one! Hence I would say the only thing priority pass lets you do is to queue for majority of the time 'outside of the queue'. Not a great value for money. We also found that some attractions were closed and staff standing outside did not provide a reason. We also faced multiple planned renovation closures.I have installed a Disney app to monitor the queues, but when the app said 15min queue it was 45min, we also found that sign outside the 'Meet Mikey Mouse' said 10min queue and it was 45min again.We did like the rides: Pirates of the Caribbean and 'its a small world' the most.",1
"We purchased 2 day pass but only went 1 day. We actually left early because we didn   t want to wait in any more lines. 1.5 hour wait for rides. 30 min wait for food and drink. Lines for vendors. No benches or anywhere to sit. They should rename the park Lineland, Paris",1
"Prior to arriving, I called up Disneyland Paris direct to request for a fridge in the hotel room within the park and was told that the hotel does not have any in room fridge. On a previous trip, this was not a problem and was promptly arranged.The operator said that in lieu of an in room fridge, I can use the fridge at the reception and I made it clear to the operator that I was storing food for my young one. Upon arrival at the hotel, I was informed that only medicines can be kept and this was strictly the case to prevent contamination. We understand the concerns and acknowledge the real risk of contamination so we did not push our case any further but we were also not offered any other alternative when we asked. In the end, fresh food that we brought had to be thrown away as there was no way to properly store it.We were then given a slip of paper to contact the guest communications department and after sending them an email, I was informed that it was the wrong email address as it had changed and when I resend it to the correct address, I was informed that there was a high amount of correspondence and that we would receive a reply withn 15 working days or we could call a line that charges a fee per minute.Next when we finally got to the parks, I was prevented from entering because I had a paramedic scissors in my bag, the type with a blunt edge but is useful for cuttring bandages. This scissors is less than 6in long and in all the domestic and international flights I have taken, I was never forbidden to bring it on board. Not one to argue with security, I trekked back to the hotel room to leave the scissors in the room. Upon return I looked up the rules again and the only line suggesting that this was forbidden is the line  items that we may deem harmful, disruptive or inappropriate . It is alright if the officer thought this was a dnagerous weapon but the problem is that I saw many others taking and using forbidden items such as portable chairs, selfie sticks etc.This was the worst Disneyland experience I had after visitng 4 different parks in the past years.",1
"they should better change their name to long queue land. everywhere its long queue ,some even goes to 120.min of waiting time. on top of it , same long queue for buying food as well. singapore universal studios and dubai's bollywood park is far far far better. pure waistage of money and time.",1
"Do not eat from the hamburger outlets inside the park. I was rushed to hospital with severe stomach pains, then spent a week in hospital on my return to the UK. I was in so much pain and lost so much blood. Avoid at all costs. The thought of returning there scares me.",1
As a lover of Disneyland and world in the States I travelled with my family. Arrived at Davy Crockett Ranch with a baby and staff were very rude. Breakfast vouchers were received for our party however they would not provide any food for the baby (2 years old) or allow us to buy any thing from the breakfast hut and breakfast was either a croissant or cereal with a tiny dry baguette with nothing on it. In the park I had been advised that the bays for prams were safe. We couldn   t believe that after we had been on the first ride we got back to the pram bay to find our   500 pram had been stolen. We went straight to the attendant in the hut next to the prams and he literally laughed in our faces and said that was the third taken today. We were told to walk to city hall and they were so dismissive and were no help at all. We eventually gave up as speaking no french we where advised we had to get a taxi for half hours drive away and report it. Totally ruined the first 3 days of our trip as we spent most of the next day looking for a pram for our baby and eventually got one and a lock . The park and rides were fun but the staff could learn so much from the Americans who simply can   t do enough for you.,1
"Visited for 3 days with my husband and 5 year old son, and coulddon't wait to get home. It was absolutely abysmal, the crowds are dangerous, I mean there are so many people it's literally dangerously overcrowded. The queues for everything are disgraceful, you spend 8 hours in the park and have time to go on about 4 rides due to the queues, we bought an autograph book, and got 2 autographs the whole time we were there, as the queues for meet and greets are all over 2 hours long. I'm not sure how there are so many positive reviews for this place, it certainly isdon't  magical  or  special  it's ridiculously overpriced and incredibly stressful. Some of the staff are incredibly rude too, one physically shoved my husband out of the way when he was stood waiting for the parade. Even my son hated it, by the third day all he wanted to do was go back to the hotel and play on the little park, I regret massively paying for this family holiday. My advice to anyone thinking of booking... dodon't do it! You'd get more  Disney magic  from a Disney DVD... Either save for the parks in Florida or take a trip to your local theme park where you'd have a much better time and save an absolute fortune. ",1
"I was absolutely appalled with how poorly this place is managed! They oversell their tickets resulting in the park being so beyond overcrowded to the point of it being a health and safety risk of suffocating! The density of the crowds was a particular nightmare for me as I am a highly sensitive person who gets really panic stricken being in crowds usually, but this was on a whole new level from the usual crowds I've had to suffer with before! They clearily oversell their tickets instead of setting a limit to the amount of people that enter the park and controlling it, as like I mention crowds are beyond abysmal and you wait in queues for rides for 1 hour and a half, so long that by the time you're done there you've only gotten round 2 or 3 rides. Not only that but literally whenever we went to one of the restaurants there to eat there were endless queues which were moving verly slowly, which was also the same for whenever you wanted to get a drink from a cart truck or something, which is so impractical and wrong when it's something essential like food and drink that you need. I mean yes it was peak season being the end of August but I still think there should of been some control over the crowds queues to make things more accessible, like not overselling their tickets.Something that really infuriated and disgusted me was when we were in the studio park and there was a sudden rainstorm, we were queuing outside the theatre place to see a show there where there was such a dense crowd to say the least, mostly due to the fact it was raining and people were trying to shelter, that there was an actual risk of suffocating as there was not control or structure of this crowd. I was infuriated and disgusted by the fact that there were no staff controlling this crowd, to say for instance that there were too many people and this crowd was all too unstructured and out of control and getting rid of lots of the people nearer the back, but instead they made the crowd worse by asking people who were just sitting down out of the queue to shelter from the rain to get up and join the queue, not the back of it but beside the people who were already at the front, despite the fact they were outside the barrier and people outside the barrier are not allowed to join the queue, so they were basically breaking their own rules! It was disgusting, they diddon't do anything to control the extremely dense crowd, instead making it worse, and just stood there apathetically, letting the crowd go denser and denser making people wait for ages. We left the crowd eventually ofcourse.Just overall appalling.",1
"The park was crowded even in an yellow orange rated day. A lot of rides were either broken or in maintenance, and even the best ones, like the Aerosmith Rock'n Roller Coaster, Phantom Manor, Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars hyperspace Mountain.We spent our fast pass in the Big Thunder Mountain, which got closed while we were in the fast pass queue to enter it, due techinical problems! And it was not solved that day! And due the time restrictions, we were unable to reschedule it.The Fireworks show was too late, when we reached the metro station in Paris, the metro was already shutdown, take care when planning it.If you already visited the Florida parks, dodon't waste your time. Even the queues in the Florida parks are funnier than the Paris' parks.",1
"Hated the place. An absolute fortune to get in and then rides no better than you would pay   1.50 to go on at a local fair. My granddaughter is 6 and the rides she was able to go on diddon't have fast track and the queues were over an hour long. The queue for the extremely poor value for money food was just as bad. Talking to a few people, while we queued, the overall impression is that they dodon't care about the people going there, they just want your money. I woulddon't recommend this place to anyone and would give it a minus rating if that was at all possible. My tip is go to the fun fair near the Louvre. The rides are much better and a bargain when compared to Disneyland.",1
"I would recommend people avoid this place like the plague in holiday times2hrs min wait time for every ride we had, kids were bored and fed up with the queues being over 2hrs for everything.we had fast pass tickets ability which my sons used a couple of times before all the ticket machines were covered over.in total my 7yr old in the space of 8 hrs visited 5 ridesmy boys got the same result being teenagers we let them run for the rides but even they only got on a few rideswe have been to other parks like asterix and walligaytor and gone on so many more ridesby 6pm they were totally fed up of queuing up and wanted to go home, understandablyso much miliage between rides just tired em out and the fact the park was flooded with people.dont waste your money, looks good but it isntthere are more food places than rides",1
"Where do I start, filthy, smelly, dirty etc. Food appalling, service pathetic, ignorant and frankly nasty staff. Meal plan, waste of money and time, 2 hour queue just for food, horrible cold food with a pathetic choice. Bus to park, well get to the    queue    last and you will get on the bus, no such thing as a queue you need to learn to PUSH even over kids and disabled NEVER seen anything like this DUMP. This is NOT Disney. Pathetically run franchise.",1
I was advise by my holiday company to go to the city hall Donald duck desk for disabled tickets which we did they took photocopies of my blue badge and gave me four tickets for each of us my carer and my two grandchildren we went and hired a wheelchair as I cant walk that far the walk from the buses to the park was long enough all rides we went to despite being in a wheelchair and showing them my badge we were not allowed on we were told we needed a green card we left the park and went to the studios and again the only ride we could get on as there was no waiting was magic carpet ride still could not get on any others we were advised to go to the information desk who gave us a green card first ride we tried to use us we coulddon't as it was reserved we got on one ride my husband was in agony trying to push a chair and trying to keep two young children safe as he has arthritis in his arms we had had enough so we had paid nearly three hundred euros for one ride no one moved for us the buses were the same my grandson fell over cutting his leg I took him into a store for first aid and was told to come back at two oclock I had been stung by a wasp earlier so I am glad I diddon't go into a shock,1
"Me and 3 friends went to Disneyland Paris to spend the bank holiday weekend, one of my friends has recently had to start using a wheelchair, it was her first time ever going to Disney and had always been a dream of hers. On our second day we were discusted with the treatment she received , when trying to get onto a ride the staff were rude, shouted at her, told her she was forbidden on the ride because she could not walk by herself (hence the wheelchair and the fact we used the wheelchair ramp access) and between themselves talking about her and laughing at her in French obviously not realising that most schools in England teach French. Even if you didn   t understand French the hand gestures and pointing were enough to understand. We then found one of the managers of the entire park, waited to see her she apologised but couldn   t keep a straight face and laughed on a couple of occasions to which her end statement was    what do you want me to do about it it   s done   , so much for a magical holiday destination this was my 3rd visit to Paris and I will not be returning. Discusting !!",1
"What an absolute waste of a day. Expensive to enter, when you get inside every place is trying to sell you more. We paid extra for the jump the queue which finished at 11am.. The wait for rides was ridiculous . We waited 50 minutes in line to get a lunch that should have been part of the deal, as it   s value was minimal. Much better fun parks around. Disneyland, your days are surely numbered.",1
parents and I took 5 year old son. got on 3 rides. There for superheroes saw none. Extortionate prices,1
"I'm a huge Disney fan! I love all things Disney...... except Disneyland Paris. It is an embarrassment to the Disney name. * Lack of maintenance, the park looks tired to say the least* poor hygiene, toilets are dirty * Lack of staff in every respect in every area and every department there is a vast lack of cast members.* hardly any characters! Forget the adverts with the Disney Character's around the park, no chance!!! Try queing for hours if your lucky, all the marvel characters are usually fully booked prior. * poor mannered, miserable, rude, slow cast members. * poor management, try asking for a manager, no chance! They have tens of thousands of people turn up a day, you dodon't matter. It's a take it or leave it scenario. In conclusion, save up for a bit longer, bite the bullet and go for a once in a life time trip to one of the American Disney's, they are truly magical and the Americans know how to do customer service.As the American Cast Members say 'have a magical day!!'",1
"I was bursting with excitement at finally visiting Disneyland, I bought my Minnie ears on the way in and skipped through the entrance gates, but what a disappointing anti climax this place is! It quickly became apparent that there are very few decent rides when it comes down to it and the queues are ridiculous. I am realistic and expected to queue and explained to the kids they would have to be patient but after four hours and only two rides they were beyond bored and it became heartbreaking while we tried to gee them on to wait for yet another ride that had then broken down. There are hardly any Disney characters circulating the park and long queues to meet the few who were there. Compared to Port Aventura, Alton Towers and Puy du Fou this place falls very short! I think if you have very small children who like little rides you will be ok and get your money   s worth but anything over 8 years old and there are better places to go.The one plus point is the clean toilets, that   s the only thing I can be positive about. I   m so disappointed ",1
"I   m going to cut straight to the chase.Disney Paris is a joke.People need to take off their rose tinted romantic glasses and look at the place for what it is. Everything, and I mean everything is geared towards taking your eyes out and pissing you off and creating suffering. I   m not going to slag off any of the cast members for being rude as I didn   t see any of that.My issue was to do with the experience itself. There is no way that the park is geared toward children at all. If it was, the process for getting your kids on a ride would have been better engineered or managed. The times for the display at night would have been more focused for small kids too. 11pm for the Final closing show and kids sitting on concrete for 2hrs before to get half a good view. No good got my 2 small children.It was incredible to experience to watch parents making small their children wait for over 60  min for a 30sec Peter Pan ride.I seen 3 4 years olds lying on the floor looking exhausted in the longest queues I   ve ever seen. Tantrums, crying and arguments between couples. It is all well and good getting a fast pass if you want to go on one of the rides for older kids (p.s they don   t work as well as you would expect.) But none of the rides for small children who are a lot more exposed in every way to tiredness etc are organised that way. We went for a fast past for one of the rides at 10am in the morning and was giving a time at 10pm that night to return... bare in mind we now couldn   t use that fast pass entitlement until we had been on that ride. Effectively wiping out any point in having one. They don   t tell you that you have to queue for absolutely everything.We queued for 40min in our hotel when we got dropped off just to get our room.We then queued for 25min to try book tables for restaurants over the next few day... to avoid queues.Then we queued for our photo passes for ages. Remember we haven   t even left the hotel yet and we had been queuing for over 2hrs. Expect to queue for any toilet Expect to queue for any food (which is terrible)Expect to queue for park accessExpect to queue for every rideExpect to queue for every single thing.The majority of our trip was standing in a queue. I honesty don   t understand how anyone can justify this as being a positive experience. This may sound obvious but seriously it   s something to consider. 95% of the spoken language on the attractions etc is in French. Now this may seem silly that I mention this but my little 4 year old girl loves marvel. The shows and experiences etc were predominantly in French. I could see how much she was gutted by not really understanding what was going on.The closing show at 11pm. Most of the Disney songs are sang in French. Yes there is the odd English songs and narration on rides but trust me.. you better brush up on your French $77 for an adult meal (for example) in the park so plan ahead for snacks and drinks.What I will say is that the magic bus and all the shuttles worked amazing. They were very dependable and just worked really well.I will never go back there as long as I live (Paris). I should have took my friends advice and gone to Florida. Next we try it we will not try to cram in all in 3 days and take 2 weeks with a villa. Take our time and go when the littles ones are older. All this can be boiled down to poor planning, wrong time of year from us as parents I must admit... but at the end of the day an expensive like this which should be positive and enjoyable shouldn   t be so forced.Bare all this in mind when your thinking about spending   2k  for a long weekend in Paris.Save your money and go to America and do it properly. Don   t get hung up on the distance. We flew from the uk and by the time we arrived and got set up in the hotel with all the waiting times and transfers, it took 7hrs form start to finish. I though it would be a lot quicker with it just being a small hop... go to America.",1
"Poor, poor, poor....So much to learn from Florida, just not on the same level. Prices are obscene, from parking to food & drink.For:Kids loved the rides, and showsAgainst:PricesEUR 40.00 to park our campervan, that does not include an overnight stayEUR 3.95 for a drinkLong queues on every ride or showSeemed to be far too many people admitted on one day?Unhelpful staffNowhere to sit down, needs more benches or tables to sit downNo shaded areas to allow people to get out of the sunNot enough food outlets for such a big park40 minute queue for a coffee",1
"After spending over $500 to get into the place we then had the pleasure of lining up in lines for a minimum of 45 mins in 35 degrees Celsius heat.  Dodon't waste your time, horrific day.",1
"We (parents, 10 year old boy and 5 year old girl) went on a Friday in mid August hoping it would be a bit less crowded than the weekend. However the park was packed full of people. It was way overcrowded and obvious that the park wasdon't designed for such a huge amount of people.Everywhere you went it was packed. Not just in the queues for the rides, but EVERYWHERE.The queues at the rides where endless. The least attractive rides where at least 45 minutes. The highlight rides where 90 minutes .We got our first fastpass at15:00 and it was for 20:40 21:00   in 6 hours time!!. We could get our next fastpasses at 17:00 but all of the fastpasses have run out from about 16:15. There were no fastpasses left almost 7 hours before the park closed!Even if you started really early with the fastpasses you could at best get 2 or 3 during the day. Very far from the 6 that they make you believe you could get.We spent about 5 hours doing 4 rides and the sheer amount of waiting in line was just exhausting. We could see parents and children all around us with looks of despair in the eyes. We then went to grab a bite and waited over 50 minutes in line to get  fast  food and then had no place to sit. All around us were families sitting on the side along the streets trying to eat and rest. It looked like a refugee camp.At around 18:00 we went by the Indiana Jones ride and the wait was 90 minutes. I asked my son if he wanted to go on it and I would wait in line with him. He got tears in his eyes and said no, he just coulddon't bear to think he would need to stand in line an hour and a half for a 2 minute ride. At that point we decided that put and end to our misery and just left. We diddon't even get to use the only fastpass we had for later that day.My daughter was really looking forward to meeting Disney characters throughout the park like we did in Disneyland in the US and Tokyo. But there were NONE. Not as single Disney character to meet and take a picture with. Overall our experience was frustrating, stressful and discouraging. Also expensive at over 300 Euro with parking (not including overpriced food). If there is anyone from Paris Disneyland with a bit of decency reading this I would expect and apology and a compensation.",1
This place is nowhere near anything like Disneyland in Anaheim Orange County California it's nothing like the original they have no food selection nothing to eat besides a can of Coca Cola a bottle of water some pizza or a hamburger they dodon't have restaurants..... We flew over from California we're really excited to see this place but it was such a let down and then the other Americans that we saw in the park spend some time talking to us and we all discussed how extremely disappointing this place is it's a complete waste of time there's nothing similar to The Magic of Disneyland in the states in Florida or in California the Disney Corporation did not work well enough with France to make this authentic~~ that is what was missing is I thought it was a very trashy version of Disneyland ....nofun no excitement,1
What a rip off    25 euros just to park and     99 to go in ques were about 90 minute s for the rides and about 45 to eat     3.75 just for water whole place is weird like a dystopian nightmare the staff are made to dress like 17 century slaves the concept stinks of colonial America go to parc astrix instead ,1
"We had planned to have the entire day in the park and thought that there would be lots to do but by around midday we were all bored and wanted to go back to the hotel. The rides were extremely dated and each of them had wait times in excess of 40 mins even the really small rides. I couldn   t believe how few rides and things to do that there were! The facilities were quite frankly disgusting. The toilets were so filthy that I was scared to touch anything. The food and restaurants were terrible and the staff were extremely rude and ill informed. The queues at the restaurants were insane and when you finally got some food the prices were unacceptable. It cost    54 for some chips, x2 veggie chilli and x2 fanta and it was not nice food at all. I was really looking forward to the parade so after killing 5 hours it finally arrived. It was sooo disappointing. There were around 6 underwhelming floats and the characters didn   t really engage with the children at all. There was no magic to this. There were no Disney characters around the park. I only saw Captain Hook who was walking from a to b. There was no interaction again with the visitors. The only thing there was plenty of in this park were shops. It felt like all Disney cared about was making as much money as possible out of its guests. A good example of this is that after paying    99 per ticket you still have to pay    25 parking?!?! That is outrageous!!!I was expecting it to be a magical, fun place to go but it was extremely underwhelming and disappointing. I would not recommend it to anyone ever. ",1
"Euro Disney is great if you like this sort of thing. It   s like a tame version of Westworld without the robots, blood and sex. Great for children but if you are a conscient adult it   s probably a living hell   nightmare of a day. Lovely to see the children enjoying the magic of the Disney characters. It was really well done and you were immersed in the experience really well.I would prefer to take my kids to a real experience like a mountain side or Lakeland stream   better for the kids and me too!!! All in all I enjoyed it but for me it as a once only experience. I would not go back!!!",1
This is a deteriorating park where most rides break down and is just a waste of money. I don   t understand how the Disney brand can stay quiet on the many breakdowns that happens here. Some staff also seem uninterested in working there to be honest. Tokyo disney was a million times better,1
"Lines everywhere, with minimum staff employed (except to sell stuff, such as 4euro ice cream that comes without a napkin). It's just about waiting. By mid afternoon it was hard to move around. Even with the fast pass system, you still have to wait. Waited 30 40 minutes for a ride that stopped working by the time we got to the end of the line. The staff cared very little   gave us a voucher to skip the line for the same ride, but it was not working so what's the point? Train stops at 5PM or something like that, boat as well. Glad we did not go for two days. Basically you pay about 90 Euros each to go on perhaps 4 or 5 things. And wait all day. Toilets not great or closed. When I arrived there I thought how American, when I left I thought how very not American. I guess it's something that you  have to  see once though. Kinda reminded me of a day in Ikea   has to be done, but it hurts.",1
"50 120min waits for rides despite having payed for a hotel within the park. Very poorly organised (a long queue and places empty within rides) many rides in maintenance or    out of order    when you   re already waiting 30min in line. We chose Disney because our daughter wanted to see her    heroes      well, it was a 2h wait for a    meet and greet    to get a picture. Very expensive restaurants within the park (45 euros for 3 people for very poor fast food, a sandwich, mac n cheese and a salad). The staff were badly trained. We will not be back, not worth the money. ",1
"Wr do I start....... went to Disney 5 years ago with my 4 year old daughter and loved it, 3 parades a day one in each park and an allumination parade at nite it was spectacular so over whelming. Took my son 4 an daughter now 10 this week,    superhero    theme for the 25th anniversary and to my sons disappointment didn   t get to meet not one superhero as they are all by appointment only, never been so disappointed at anything in my life, one parade a day and it last 12 mins, the amount of money goin into that place Walt really needs to bring it back to life instead of an outdated commercialised money makin scam,    35 for 3 chips and 3 kids nuggets.... rides which u que for hours an last 3 mins max, not a Disney princess in sight and the ones in parade are still wearing dresses they wore 5 years ago and they look so grubby. The only good thing about the whole place is the fireworks.. Paid    50 for incredible suit an    25 for the doll and had to cause a scene in order to get my son to meet Mr & Mrs incredible because u have to book an appointment to meet them!! They didn   t mind takin my money for the suit thou...... Update your park an get the characters out in the grounds for people to meet them, instead of them just running past kids an they aren   t even aloud to approach them as they have security with them!!!!! Save your money an your time this is not fun!",1
"We were super pumped about taking the kids to Disneyland as part of our Europe trip. What a let down   there were more Disney merchandise shops than rides. Many rides were closed for renovation etc., and this meant huge queues for the few rides that were operating. This obviously led to immense strain for certain rides: we queued for Big Thunder Mountain (one of the few operating rides) for an hour until it broke and closed for the day. It is all filler and no substance   seriously just merchandise, there's not much to do. My son counted 32 merchandise outlets on Disneyland map app, and on the day we visited the rides operating were the (1) Hyperspace Mountain, (2) Buzz Lightyear Blast (actually okay), (3) Orbitron (addressed up merry go round), (4) the Autopia car driving, (5) Dumbo the Flying Elephant and (6) Peter Pan, oh and the aforementioned Thunder Mountain (broke down). The Swiss Family Robinson tree house feature looked exciting but its just a walk (yes, a walk) up and down a concrete tree   no slides, swings etc.I'm not sure how you would fill two days here; possibly most of this time would be spent queuing for your lunch in the Pizzeria Belle Notte. There's nothing vaguely magical about it. Actually the magical part is how it has kept open all these years. If this were my theme park I would be ashamed. My kids (10 and 8) hated it and of the 32 day trip in Europe they ranked their visit to Disneyland Paris as the worst day.Terrible waste of money and time. So disappointing.",1
"We visited in May, hoping it was less people. That was clearly a bad choice, it was crowded, crowded, crowded. All attractions had waiting time 45 120 min. The park should have a maximum number of visitors, it felt like a place you just want to get away from. Endless waiting time to buy food, no chill zones to relax. We rested on a small lawn, and was asked by staff to get up and keep moving. Of course it is expensive  , but that would have been OK, if the experience was good. This was just terrible. The kids was so eager to go, but Disney had got a terrible reputation in our family after this.",1
"What a terrible disappointment. We chose to spend our last day at Disney Paris   what a bad decision.The ONLy good part was the parade   it was exceptional.EVERYTHING else was disgraceful and a complete rip off.Many of the rides and restaurants were closed, which resulted in long queues everywhere...we waited for an average of 45 minutes per ride   VERY frustrating for kids aged 7 and 9...and really annoying for parents.Honestly, waiting for almost an hour for a 5 minute ride is NOT okay.What do they allow so many thousands of people in when the facilities available cannot cope.This is just ridiculous in the middle of summer, high season.....why dodon't they refurbish their attractions in winter when there are less people visiting?Totally ridiculous.We had to queue for a cool drink, pop corn and all the food and the prices were exhorbitant and the food was atrocious.Overall it was just a shabby money making scheme, riding on the back of the Disney label,We STRONGLY advise anyone visiting Paris to just avoid this awful experience. Coming from Cape Town, South Africa...our local amusement park is significantly better....on every level.We loved Paris but truly regret the time and money spent here.AVOID.",1
"Had a terrible experience at Disneyland Paris. I bought the 1 day pass for both parks and we decided to visit Disneyland first. There were queues of 60   90 minutes at most of the rides we wanted to visit right from the start. They have stopped selling the old FastPass now and there is a new system wherein you can get a fastpass for each ride individually for free. What it basically does is give you a time slot to return to the ride that there is a huge wait in, and join the fastpass line at that stage. However if you have collected a fastpass for one ride, you will not get another fastpass till you have completed that ride.It took us a while to figure this system out as no one told us about it and nor is it mentioned on the website. Hence we wasted 90 minutes on our first ride. In all we could only manage 6 rides in the entire day due to it being so crowded. The Disney app is supposed to show wait times but kept glitching and going off so we coulddon't use it to plan our day better. We decided to move to Disney studios at around 6pm only to be told that it would shut at 7 pm, even though the ticket says 10 pm. Only managed 1 ride there.The kids were really disappointed as a lot of the rides were either closed for refurbishment or kept breaking down causing even more delays. Last time I go to a Disney park. Very disappointing.",1
"Purchased a 1 day 2 park ticket, entered the park at 11am and all went well until 5pm when the rides began to close. Took the children for an ice cream where a few customers were still being served only to be told they were closing and no morecustomers would be served. So off to Disney Studios to use our 2 park tickets only to be refused entry   special event only entry at an additional fee. No where was it mentioned about rides closing from 5pm or anything about a special event taking place when we purchased the ticket   did they care not one bit. Totally different attitude to that in Florida",1
"It should not have the name    Disney    on it!If you ever have been to Disney World in Orlando you will be totally disappointed if you go to Disneyland n Paris.Poor service from staff.Wi Fi does   t work.We are in July in the beginning of high season and there are 19 attractions closed!!! Yes, 19 attractions closed!    Totally unacceptable. How come the cam charge full tickets from costumers. The park it self is a super mini poor version compared to the original Disney World and they open the doors during high season with 19 closed attractions on a Friday. What a hell is that?!It is a MUS NOT DO! Don   t waste your time and your money.Disney World management: just close this park or sell it to change the name. It is a huge downgrade for tour brand.",1
"Huge, huge queues to every attraction, everytime. You have to stay in line 90% of the time of your day here. And they could implement electronic queue   just with digital screens and numbers   no, dear guests, you HAVE TO stay in queue with all your kids in these huge queues to enter in every attraction in Disney Land Paris. Please, hire Herman Gref to manage this place   he certainly knows how to work with overcrowded areas (see Sberbank case, please). Very bad managed business, sorry for that.",1
"It's hard to believe this Disney park and Disney in Orlando are part of the same company. The staff in Orlando coulddon't be more friendly if they tried and every staff member I encountered in Euro Disney were rude, sour faced and obviously hate there jobs... The park it self is nicely laid out and clean.. The kids loved it but I will not return simply because of the attitudes of the French staff members..",1
"Many of the attractions were closed for  refurbishment , making the lines elsewhere ridiculously long. French have no idea how to run a Disney park. Same goes for adjacent Studio Park next door. Save your money and take the kids to Le Jardin d    Acclimation instead.",1
Worst amusement park in europe.   2 h waiting in each atractions. Very ineffective french service at any shop. Behind the sence tramp was over in 6 minutes and were outdated.   An amusement park in 2018 without a 4d cinema???  Exremely overpriced.   Spend your money elswhere.,1
"Been to Disney many times in the US and here in a Paris. Hugely disappointed on this occasion, lots of major rides closed for long term maintenance, pirates of the Caribbean, rocking rollercoaster, phantom Manor, mad hatter tea cups to name just a few. This obviously has a huge impact on the Queuing times of the remaining rides, and given that this park does not operate the US online fast pass system it means you will be very stretched to complete the remainder of the rides. Obviously very expensive for us Brits since the brexit exchange rate turmoil but that   s our problem but....entry pricing should reflect the availability of the rides ! My advice would be to delay your visit until the park is up and running like something approaching normal operations otherwise you will likely be disappointed.",1
"This is our first of a three day visit to Disneyland Paris. A lot of attractions are closed due to maintenance: haunted mansion, pirates of the carribean, teacups, rock   n roller coaster, star wars, meet spiderman,...to many to mention acctually... and this on it   s 25th anniversary! Bad Disney, very, very bad!!!!",1
"Disneyland is a funfair where you should enjoy rides that have Disney themes and characters. However this is not what you get. The visit is very costly (about    130PP for a two day two parks), and your time is wasted queuing and waiting for things to happen which would only take seconds. My visit started 10:30am and ended at 6:30pm. During this whole 8hours we have only been to 2 rides!!!! How did this happen? Ok 40mins waiting to exchange the vouchers we got from online booking to actual tickets. 30mins waiting to pass through the gates. 45mins waiting for each of the two rides (which one was about 10mins long and the other 35seconds long). 40mins waiting to order and get lunch from one of the restaurants. 35mins waiting in mickeys house to take a pic with the character (done in about 20seconds). 50mins waiting time (standing) for the    famous    parade. Plus obviously the moving time between rides.In short this place is overpriced and overrated and should be avoided. Alternatively, if you have some money that you want to part with to get into a rich experience, you are better off going to a theatre, and you could actually go to the Disney   s Lion King play which is very nicely done and your kids could enjoy the experience without the hideous torture of waiting on your feet for long hours.",1
"Having never been to Disneyland before, I was rather excited to go, but upon our arrival and for the 3 or so hours that we were there we really hated it. First off, the   60 odd entrance ticket was ridiculous, particularly so as the park is genuinely made up of three quarters or so of shops and restaurants. Where were all the rides and rollercoasters? (I was expecting the works)!The queues were also atrocious. 1 2 hr waits for a ride less than two minutes. Not worth it and definitely not what I would consider to be a fun day out.It   s apparent that as many people as possible are crammed into a small park, with little rollercoasters, rubbish food and loads of extra costs. It   s obviously a prime example of capitalism at its finest and it   s no wonder to me that Disneyland Paris has had some financial issues. 3 hours was more than enough for us! Never again. Honestly, in my opinion Blackpool pleasure beach had better rides and that   s saying something!!!If you truly want a magical experience, a fun day out for the whole family (no matter what age), good quality food and decent rides and rollercoasters, get yourself to Tivoli in Copenhagen!",1
"I tried to buy online tickets for my family at the Disneyland Paris Parks. The system allowed me to input all my details including my credit card but gave an error message in the end. After trying 10 times, I decided to call Disneyland Paris directly. The phone was busy most of the time and I was receiving call us back later messages. After trying over 10 times, I was able to reach someone he was nice and friendly. I bought tickets for 2 parks for 2 days valid for a year and then I received a confirmation number.After I hang up, I received online confirmation and a link to download my documents. I downloaded but it was almost the same document without any barcode. As an experienced traveller I started seeing in my dreams potentially going through the torture how to convert this document into bar coded tickets. The time came, we went to Disney Paris and it was worse than my nightmare. They guided us to 3 different waiting lines at which we waited more 45 mins each. I spent more than 2 hours for buying these tickets and spent more than 2 hours finding the right queue for converting my letter confirmation into my barcoded tickets. Now, I am still waiting my turn at the guest relations while writing these sentences. I do not know what will happen next..",1
"After talking to a Disney rep at the hotel we were staying at, we decided to get the park hopper for an extra $50. It cost us $167 per ticket. Now you think the rep would have told us about the incredible wait times but nope, she didn   t....must work on commission.So we head to the park the next day, going through security is hilarious. They think they are protecting the country. My belt set off the metal detector. I told them it   s my belt. I was pulled aside, and they use a hand held on you, shirt up, belt buckle flipped...because you can hide so much behind that you know.We decided to go to Adventure first. When we got to Soaring, there was a 50 minute wait. Forget that, off to the next ride to find the same thing.We opted to go over to Disneyland where we found the same wait times. We had to suck it up and stand in line. We were so frustrated after 2 hours that we went on the boat that goes around in a circle just to say we went on a ride! The fast passes are a waste of time as well. You can only hold one at a time. We ended up going to get a fast pass for Soaring at 5 pm. We were given a comeback time of 8:30 to 9:30 pm....3 hours later!!At the end of the day, we went on 6 rides, 2 of them kids rides just to try and feel like we were getting value. It ended up costing over $27 per ride!!!I don   t know what bothered me more, waiting over 50 minutes per ride or the fact that nobody else seemed to be bothered.I wrote an email to Disney and got a so sad, too bad e mail back. I responded saying that we bought off or your rep and she should have told us that the park hopper was a waste of money. I received another e mail saying....are you still communicating with us on this matter? Sorry you didn   t like our response. We will not be refunding you anything. Our wait times are posted on our app......are you kidding me? I have to download your app to get the times!Their customer service doesn   t get it. They are making a fortune there and they don   t care about you. They don   t realize that not wanting to do anything for people just buys them what we spent 10 fold in negative advertising.Don   t waste your money. Go elsewhere.",1
"My review compares this park with Disney World and DisneyLand in US. The format is the same of course, more or less same attractions, Disney World is 20 times greater. But thw difference in the experience is given by the services: staff in Disney Land Paris is completely unprepared, most of them doesdon't like the work (or to work!). Disorganization is the rule. Long lines for everything even on a mid week working day of May. By Long lines I mean 60mins for a horse carousel riding for less than 3mins, 75 minutes to eat in a fastfood!! I cadon't even imagine what happen in the week end!! It's obvious that the staff and people make the difference. Now I understand why this park it's on lose Very bad experience at all.",1
"Once upon a time there was a princess called Ava aged 6, she lived in the Magic Kingdom for a few days loving the wonderful rides and shows. On the fourth day she went on lots of rides and was very tired. She wanted something to eat and go to bed early. Unfortunately, the Newport Bay hotel did not provide enough facilities to cater for Princess Ava and her family for dinner and was told she had to wait until 10:30 pm to eat, way past her bedtime of course. Ava became tearful and hot with the stress of being very tired and hungry. Her mother went to the evil receptionist to explain the situation,    you should have booked a table    he remarked.    But my daughter is very tired and hungry she can not wait until 10:30 pm    she replied,    You should have booked a table    he said.    We tried to book tables on the first day in the parks and village but they were all booked up for the whole of our stay    she explained    So we thought we would just have to eat at the hotel   ,    You should have booked a table    the red eyed receptionist bellowed.    But we have stayed in hotels around the globe and have never been told we can not eat until 10:30 pm with a young child    princess Ava   s Mum said.    You should have booked a table    he shouted.    Are there any other restaurants available now in the park?    She asked,    No, You should have booked a table   , at that moment smoke started to appear underneath the receptionist and he turned into a 20 ft tall sabre tooth tiger, so Ava   s Mum said to Ava   s Dad I   m scared and we all ran away. Disappointed and crying with tiredness and hunger princess Ava felt sad. Her father went to get her a piece of bread and water so she could at least stop the hunger pains. She ate the bread and drank the water and went to bed crying on her Mickey ears and overpriced princess dress. Disneyland and the Newport Bay hotel lived happily ever after........ ",1
"Just come back from Disneyland Paris and was really surprised that the price of everything has gone up dramatically. Not to say that we diddon't have fun because we did, but compared to two years ago it seems like they are getting very greedy, so beware and try not to let it spoil your time away but be mindful of the extra expense. See attached receipts.",1
"We took our kids on a Europe vacation for 3 weeks, and Disneyland was supposed to be the highlight. We stayed in a Disney Hotel to get the extra magic time with 8h30 access to the park. We had four days, three nights at Disneyland and I will need a few days to recover from that experience. There were so many people. Everywhere. We kept track of waiting times for all rides with the app, but it really doesdon't help much when the general minimum waiting time is at least 45min, even for the old, outdated rides. So that's all we did: we waited in line. Then you get your 90 to 120 seconds on a ride, and then you wait some more. Fast track is not available for most rides, and it's also closed during peak time (13h00 16h00). Quite a few rides are closed for refurbishment, and some others were just temporarily closed for technical issues. It happened twice that rides were closed after we had stood in line for at least 20 or 30 minutes, that was extra special. For lunch, we diddon't even bother with real restaurants even though we had vouchers, we thought the fast food line would be faster. But even there you can expect 35 to 45 minutes just to place your order. It was really insane. The parades are very beautiful, but you better claim your spot on the pavement at least 30 minutes early if you have small kids, because there is not enough space for all visitors to see it. If it's burning hot like it was on our days, you better prepare to wait in the burning sun for a long, long time, defending your viewpoint. The parade is pretty much your only chance to see the disney characters, unless you feel like waiting in line for 60 minutes to take a picture with Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse or Goofy. For the princess, you queue for 120 minutes. What a great way to spend your holiday. Extra magic time is a bit of a joke. You can see there are a lot less people in the park, but most of the rides only open at 10h00 in any case, so the joke was on us, again. The park itself is designed in a really beautiful way. We coulddon't really focus much on it as we were getting worried we would lose our kids in the crowds. I really thought they would have more playgrounds around, to take pressure of the rides, and maybe more rides for small kids, also to take pressure of the more popular rides. The railings were a clear sign that it's not even season yet. In season, visitors should prepare for a minimum of 70 minutes per queue, the more popular rides will take a good 2h. We spent a lot of money on this trip. I can see how Disneyland could be a lot of fun. I cadon't see how it is even legally allowed to let so many people in. Luckily we had our phones on us and we downloaded enough eBooks beforehand, so I got to read the new Dan Brown and an old Lee Child while   you guessed right   waiting in a long, long queue.",1
"What an awful place to visit, nothing but an overpriced paedophiles paradise, after earning a free 3 day trip for myself and my family, we genuinely expected this to be a once in a lifetime holiday...It is once in a lifetime, i would honestly never spend 3 days with 2 children aged 7 and 1 anywhere in the world and have less to do, the highlights of the park were the park (as in childrens park with 2 slides) and the scenery ('nice' scenary)The rides (what rides?) are literally scenary with little or no excitement, i checked google to find the top rides after day 1 thinking that we just have missed something, it turned out that we had already done the top attractions, leaving day 2 to try and find something fun within this ridiculously expensive mass of land (hence the park with 2 slides)After hours spent queuing for rides that would be disappointing at a primary school Fayre, we decided to watch one of the shows, this turned out to be just as awful as the rides, the same song blaring out for hours upon hours with no connection to Disney, yes the characters are there, but they simply dodon't connect with anything, its just awful music, repeating itself, again, and again, and again, and again, and again....My daughter had been massively looking forward to coming here and wanted to leave after 3 hours, even spending hundreds of euros in the shops barely helped matters, on day one she told me that 'this is the worst holiday you have ever taken us on'(and we've been to pontins!) on day 2 she told me that she doesdon't want to sound ungrateful but, Alton towers is loads better (anyone who has been to both will agree)Moving on to the juicy stuffOn day 1, although disgusted by the place, i tried to feed my family at tea time, we literally tried every restaurant in the Disney village, all were either full or entered via the wrong door and after queueing we were forced to go to another entrance that was not clearly marked, After trying to spend a ridiculous amount of time in numerous places we eventually found somewhere that was capable of taking my money and putting something on a tray..... If I could swear here I would, we purchased 2 chicken wraps and a kids chicken nuggets, expecting as it's    42 that the food would be warm....Nope, the type of thing you buy in a petrol station half way through an 11 hour journey because you are starving, only 15 times the price,Day 3 will occur tomorrow and this is the most exciting day, simply because we get to go home, no one could possibly pay me enough money to take my family to this vile place again !",1
"My boyfriend and I visited visited Disneyland years ago, and I had fond memories of it. Perhaps we were lucky as we went during a quiet time (week before Easter) and we enjoyed the rides and other attractions. Fast forward 12 years, and my boyfriend and I are married with two kids, 9 and 7. We booked a trip to Paris, and I was keen on visiting Disneyland for two days (the husband wasdon't so happy about it), so I booked online and bought tickets for two days, Friday 25 and Saturday 26 of May.We arrived at Disney only to be greeted by huge queues to get through security. Then more queues to scan our tickets. After 30 minutes, we finally made it into the park. The first ride I wanted to go in, the train that goes around the park, already had a waiting time of 60 minutes. Things went downhill from there. Huge queues at most of the rides, some rides were not working, fastpass was not working on some of the most popular rides. The children started complaining about lunch time, and asking when could we go back to the hotel. I had spent a lot on money on the tickets, so by golly we were staying for longer. They wore me down around 6ish, so we went to the shopping centre near the hotel and they had more fun on the little playground area than Disney. When I announced that we had tickets for the following day as well, they groaned. As it was a Saturday, it was even worse. Ridiculous queuing, fastpasses working only on half the attractions with fastpass, more shops and restaurants than attractions, and the hordes of people. Oh, the hordes. Buying overpriced ice creams (nearly 4 euros!!!!), drinks, meals and assorted tat. I gave up all hope at around 5ish, we went back to the hotel, had a nice meal at the restaurant nearby, and swore never to set foot on that hellhole again. My children would never forgive me, and they are the ones who are going to choose my care home when I'm old.The only highlight of our trip was the day spent in Paris. I wish I had known, we would have had three days to spend in beautiful Paris instead of on.So, a quick summary:*Too many people. Seriously, WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE*Stupidly long queues (see above)*Tired rides, fastpass unavailable in over half the attractions with fastpass*overpriced food and drinks*Unhappy childrenNEVER AGAIN!",1
"We choose the middle of May to try and avoid the peak summer months.Weather was fine. Disneyland Park and Disney Studios Park on the other hand were terrible. Both where visibly overcrowded and most rides had a waiting time shown of 50 to 70 minutes. I wonder how it must be during peak season. This was supposedly off peak and the chaos was the same each of the 5 days we stayed there. Buying a  FASTPASS  didnt help much as it is not valid between 1 and 4 pm and making a booking gave you a time of 5.30pm or later. Haunted Mansion was closed for refurbishment, Space Mountain was closed due maintenance. The waiting time also was ridiculously long at the fastfood outlets and those few restaurants offering sit down table service you couldnt get a table unless you booked the previous day. All in all a waste of our time and money. We paid for the Disneylandhotel (5 nights at halfboard) with park passes included for 3 of us the stupid price of 4300euro. On a positive note, since we were firced to skip several breakfasts, lunches and dinners, voicing my frustration upon check out, the reception at the hotel offered us a partial refund in exchange for the meal vouchers we were not able to use due overcrowding in the available Disney restaurants. We visited Disney in other countries in previous years and this is about the worse experience we had ever. A very disppointed family who is not ready to repeat this disaster anytime soon. Next time we will choose smaller less crowded attraction parks and say away from this ill organized large production line factory.",1
"So so overrated, what a load of crap. Hectic is an understatement and very very expensive to eat and drink their. Room was dirty would never go back we will stick to the Caribbean! My 3 year old hated it I did to.",1
Wow. How the mighty have fallen. I have not been for about 12 years and was totally horrified to find out how much the place has deteriorated. Quite a few of the rides were not open.    15 for a burger. The main cafe was filthy. 90 minutes queuing for a ride. The whole place is in need of refurbishment. Comparing it to Florida there is no comparison. Rip off. ,1
"The park and the attractions are beautiful and well maintained. The staff and service however is very poor and even offensive. The booking process was very time consuming with multiple calls where we were put on hold for 30 minutes or more, almost impossible to make reservations at restaurants and overall poor service. When we arrived: We are with a group with a person in a wheel chair. Upon booking nobody advised on the facilities for disabled (get the disabled pass!). When we enter the park with a wheelchair, nobody said: if you want a disabled pass, pls go to city hall. The most frustrating part is that every time I say I am disappointed, the response is    the rules are...   . I heard no apologies, no service mindset, no customer focus. When I ask to speak to the manager, I get downgraded to speak to one of the staff. Disney has missed the plot in Paris. Very disappointing. ",1
"Well where to start.We went on a family trip for 2 days,1 night at Santa fe hotel.The hotel and staff were friendly and pleasant.So on the short walk up to the park we get to the disney village where the shops and food outlets are,looks really clean and tidy .You start to get into that magical feeling of disney,looking forward to getting in the park.Get to the entry gates greeted by a really grumpy rude staff member,oh ok not a good start.The parade starts not long after we get in so it makes up for it , so get back into it.Really good parade the pirate and princess.Starting to walk around and go to rides finding that a wait time of an hour for most of them in general. We go to get a drink and ice cream at a vendor, to hard for them to say hello and goodbye apart from how much they want.Not long into the park i say to my wife ,why are people looking so miserable jokingly. We did not see any characters walking around the park at all, you can wait for an hour to meet one.The magical feeling dissapering quickly here.The food is very expensive and awful ,frozen mush heated in a microwave.You can get better looking food at loan prices.A good thing here now, the closing show was awesome really good and felt like disney .My opinion is that the park is loosing money every year and this shows, things look tired and run down no money being put into it.The staff probably hate working there and wages are probably bad (my opinion)Not once did we hear welcome to Disneyland, you do not feel a part of it. I think disney land paris has had its time.Close the doors on it, this is not what Walt Disney would want of it. I am sorry to say this.There is no magic there.",1
"The last time I was here was in Septmeber 2011. They now have two parks instead of one. Visited on a Friday, so it was not too bad for the crowds. Disneyland Paris is now owned by Disney itself, so they were still in transition on how they where moving toward how Disney is usually managed. I purchased my tickets online and it would work at the entrance so I had to spend about 45 minutes with the ticket agent for them to re issue my tickets, as their system was being merged and coulddon't find our information but I had showed them my email confirmation. The only thing that we really enjoyed was the Buffalo Bill Wild show. However, the meal they served was horrible! We had baked beans, ribs, one small sauage, one chicken leg and potatoes with either beer or coke with apple pie and ice cream. We're not big eaters, so it diddon't bother us, however our dinner companions were mad, as our server never served us more than once for refills. Having beento all the Disneys around the Globe (California, Florida, Hong Kong, Shanghai and soon Tokyo), Disney World is by far the best, as you dodon't have to pay extra for fast pass and there are way more things to do if you're an adult.",1
We've just come back from DisneyLand Paris and 6 rides (including the main ones   such as 'Hyperspace Mountain' weredon't working). I woulddon't mind if we diddon't have to queue for an hour for all the remaining rubbish rides but I think it was just a waste of time and money,1
"Disneyland Paris is so utterly shabby compared to its other parks across the Atlantic. Nothing    magical    at all about it   no music playing, staff are so miserable. For the price I paid for 3 days here you could easily get a cheap flight and head to Florida with its sunshine and amazing customer service and a proper    magic of Disney    feel.Too many equally miserable parents screaming at their kids too!Will never ever return   even Haven holidays beat the hell out of this place!",1
"Awful experience. Waste of money to stand in lines all day for absolutely everything. Our group was hangry all day. At one hotdog restaurant that we could bear the lines for, our items were bagged because there was not enough seating. Couldn   t even spend money for beer, even when trying, due to terribly long lines. Skip this experience for sure. Waste of time and money. Perhaps go to Disney village for a movie, walk, shopping, countryside train ride, but don   t buy tickets to the park. You will be sorry. ",1
"Was so much overcrowded (march, weekday) that im afraid my kids will remember the lines, not the attractions... The park itself is perfect, staff manages the lines perfectly, but lines at security, entrance, toilets, restaurants, attractions, everywhere... Ok, its a kind of  must see once  for kids, but im happy that we are done with it...",1
"We visited Disneyland Paris over Easter Weekend 2018. We have been visiting Disneyland Florida for the past 10 years and decided to try the Paris Disneyland for a change. We are extremely disappointed with our visit to Disneyland Paris, maybe because of visiting Florida so many times before   however, the amount of money for a ticket to Disneyland Paris we expected more attractions   rides and general things to do whilst we were there. The park doesn   t offer many attractions   rides so all of the wait times were 60 minutes or more. There were also no fast passes left for any of the main attraction rides that we were wanting to go on. This being said, we were only at the park around 3 hours which includes an hour sit down meal. Considering a 2 park ticket is almost 90 Euro   s per person, we expected to be wowed with Disney   s Paris attractions as Florida has never disappointed us. I would not recommend anyone to visit Disneyland Paris and would instead recommend you save your money and visit Disneyland Florida instead which is a fantastic family holiday and experience for all   great weather, great parks and great memories to be had. Don   t waste your money at Disneyland Paris.",1
Firstly there is the entry. Suggest you buy your tickets before you go. There was a 2 hour delay when we went to buy tickets at the park and staff keep shuffling queues around opening and closing booths. Logistically they failed. There is a total lack of staff outside the gates to assist and advise many people joined queues to buy tickets only to find after long delays they could go up and enter straight away. If you have a ticket with security checks and entry to the park it   s probably 30 45 minutes. If you don   t have tickets probably 1.5 to 3 hours delay in getting in. Then once your into the park you   ll quickly notice how crowded it is. It   s only just over half the size of other Disneyland parks and you feel it in lack of places to sit and recover. Ride wait times were ridiculous when we went with most being 40 60 minutes. That means you   ll be lucky to get 5 rides into a full day. The food is as expected very expensive and massed produced poor quality food. Queues are ridiculously long for even just a soft drink or water. Save your money Paris has so much more to offer unless your into queues spending money crowds and mass produced flavorless food. ,1
"We went to DisneyLand Paris for 3 days with our children. We were so disappointed: the queues were incredibly long, there were very few staff and those who were around were not helpful. The food was awful and very expensive and to top things off the water fountains had been turned off which meant you had to buy water from the shops. In short, it was an overpriced and unsatisfactory experience. We wodon't ever return.",1
"Been to Disneyworld and Disneyland many times. The only way you would enjoy Disney Paris is if you   d never been to a    real    Disneyland. Most restaurants, food vendors, and rides closed. Few rides running were abruptly shut down leaving lines at those still running massively long. Gave up and left. GO TO A U. S. PARK and experience Disney as Walt intended. ",1
"I have done a lengthy write up under Disney studios that covers all parks and Disney town,, but in short my negatives are it's run down and does not give the kids a true reflection on what Disney is like,, the french people are very rude to English but their are a few nice ones,, smoking areas dodon't get used by smokers they stand in queues and walk around with fags in mouths,, classy,, staff dodon't enforce it because you dodon't see any,, you pay around   4 for a can of coke and the parade has only around 6 floats so dodon't get too excited,, Disney town reminds me of a seaside town beach front,, so so dirty looking,, give your kids a true Disney experience and save and go to Disney florid a ,, Disney have really let their name down having Disney here,, no communication , information or direction,, it's not buggy friendly either,, you have to carry infants in queues for photos with characters and you could be standing for 2 hours,, My only positives are eating in the rain forest cafe really good quality food, best food you will get around their,, it's around   23 for burger and chips,, and I also recommend eating with characters which is around   65 but can be cheaper with your hotel vouchers.",1
Went here in January for a day trip with my friend. We love theme parks and last year had done all USA Disney parks so wanted to add Paris to our ever growing list of parks. We had high hopes of this being as magical and overwhelming as other Disney parks.... God was we wrong yes it has the rides and has the castle but it just has no magic. Unhelpful and moody cast members. Areas where run down and incredibly tatty. Food was so basic and soo over priced I mean    16 for a basic small burger and soggy chips... Again magic people where is it. Also you policy on disabled people is different to USA this should have been informed to us as it wasdon't and    20 to park in a car park that we are only there because we are paying to visit your park........ I can imagine is Walt Disney was around now he would be incredibly disappointed and ashamed of how his name is being used at this park.Fireworks where ok. But again lacked the size and imagination I would expect of a Disney park. ,1
"Returned from a family 2 day stay. So disappointed. I can only describe Disneyland Paris as an overpriced, dated theme park. (If the rides are working. ) Visited with our 3 half year old son who was so excited to meet Mickey Mouse and the other Disney characters. Good Luck if you can find them! We found Mickey Mouse and queued about 1hr 40 minutes for a picture. Much the same for Pluto, Buzz & Woody over 2 days. Prices are extortionate for everything, everywhere is dated and on the boarder of dirty. Cold water in the toilets, no hand wash or paper towels. I actually feel we were robbed. Would not recommend , absolutely would not return even for free!! ",1
"I really wanted to love this place, I have never been to any Disney as a child or an adult but everyone raves about it and I thought I would treat my partner and my two children (6 and 3) to a long weekend here. The price was extortionate but I thought I'm paying for that Disney magic and service so all was booked including Disney express for the train to maximise our time. When we got there we went in to the park to be met with 45  min queues...ok so it's half term to be expected, we queue go on the rides and the boys enjoy it that's a positive!We manage to do about 3 rides despite arriving at 2.30 local time, we did not spot any characters for the whole day and have massive issues getting any food. The light and firework show at the end were 10 mins where I really felt impressed and  wow  then back to the hotel(sequoia lodge) , nice check in staff but then we have to collect luggage and take to our own room   Disney not that express it seems ! Room is small, has 3 plugs only 2 of which work with a tiny and oddly shaped bathroom. Next morning we are up and out for those extra  Magic Hours  eagerly walking over to take advantage of our extra time...to see...most of the rides are roped off closed with some staff member telling u they are not open till 10.00. So we try other parts and they are closed, only one part of the park is actually open with about 3 rides all with stupidly long queues. The motor show in Walt Disney studios was great but again let down by the customer service. All in all I really wanted to love this but I just felt conned by it all, all they want to do is suck every last euro out of you for rubbish, the irony is I woulddon't mind paying through the nose for it but it isdon't true Disney I felt no magic, no the  customer is number 1 , we diddon't feel special and isdon't that why we pay to come here? It's like any other theme park but you pay a premium to be here, I have been told that the American one is amazing, maybe it's a cultural thing but this one is very poor and a massive rip off for any food and drink in the park. Overall I just feel conned and slightly bitter about my experiences here and would recommend not going to anyone thinking about it, use the money and book a great week away somewhere else ! ",1
"My family and I normally love Disney, and infact have Annual passes, however I have just returned after experiencing the worst customer service I have ever experienced there.While I was there with my family for New Years Eve I went into City Hall and asked if Jedi training would be coming back for Season of the Force, and I was told YES. So as soon as we got home i booked to return 6 weeks later with my daughter who has wanted to do Jedi training since they cancelled it before she became 7.As you can imagine my daughter was very excited to be going back to experience the Jedi training, and took it very badly when we arrived in Discoveryland to find out it wasdon't on. I went straight to City Hall to complain as that was the only reason we went back so soon, to be told  Yes it was planned but then we cancelled it, if you would have checked online you would have seen that it was cancelled  (which I cadon't find any mention of a cancelation anywhere) and that  There are other Starwars animations and shows , which diddon't really make up for the money I spent to get there! Dodon't think I'm the sort of person who expects compensation or anything like that, but I was shocked at the fact that even though I had explained to the the member of staff in City Hall the fact I was on a holiday I diddon't need to be on, and where I'd left my wife at home with a our youngest daughter, all they could say was,  Sorry about that .So just be wared that they can cancel planned events without informing you, all of this after raising the price of our Annual passes by    150 each!",1
"I visited for a much needed break with my 8 and 7 year old in January for a weekend. We came from uk and stayed at the New York so my comments are based on just this   a Disneyland park package holiday. This included tickets, early entry, full board and hotel. It is also worth noting we have visited WDW before. I was extremely disappointed in every area. Firstly, pervasive were staff   they tried, but this left them acceptable   not the Disney difference and when things were not right, that customer service element was absent. That is so key to Disney, that attitude that you are here for something magic and we try to achieve that. The worst bit is they don   t even recognise it as a problem because it isn   t even part of the culture.The rides are mostly just that   there is nothing really unique here and what there is seems to have been pulled away   autopia not running, 3D show where captain eo was has gone, the fantastic pirate ship not open to public, playground closed. There is just no sparkle   lol those street performers, all the waving cast members on Main Street, all those ad hoc shows   none of that. It is just like another theme park. And seeing characters walking around clocked like some sort of creature rather than through hidden cast member access simply freaked my kids out. Poor show   Walt would not approve.The food is appalling   I made this comment 10 years ago on this site and prices have gone up and quality down. We ate two dinners and both cost over 100 euros and was inedible.The PhotoPass is beyond a rip off 60 euros for ride photos of low quality you don   t even want. As with many things you may judge this against the photopass you get in America were you will get dozens of photos taken per day   we didn   t get a single one outside a ride photo Conclusions   we enjoyed some rides. This was not worth the money, not special and destroyed buildings, characters and attractions that in America through these subtle staff and strategic elements become special. I would strongly recommend you don   t visit or if you do, go for one day, do not purchase food and stay off site ",1
"The adverts are so far removed from the reality of this money pit. Low on fun, high on queues & extraction of money. Example. Queue to buy a ticket to see the princesses in certain time slot 30 mins. Then join the queue to see them and wait a further 2 hrs to see one princess. To then be told that they want a further    25 to see more than one of the princesses. try to get some decent food. It is all Deep fried and sugar. You might average 1 ride per hour if you are lucky. Bitterly disappointed as were the kids. Will never return. ",1
"After being spoiled with Florida I felt there are some glaring problems here that are easy to solve.Poor service: I experienced poor service at some point on every day of my stay.A cast member stood right in front of ny 4 year old daughter throughout an entire parade, she turned up after us to marshall the parade and when asked to move slightly she stepped forward 4 inches and still blocked her view.Security woulddon't allow us to the Disneyland Hotel for breakfast as the park wasdon't open despite me showing them proof of our reservation.A cast member refused to speak English to me when I was clearly struggling (who I then heard speaking English 15 mins later to somebody else)",1
"I went to visit Disneyland Paris last week. Before I went, I looked up the ticket prices on the website and in the brochure from my hotel in Paris, both said ticket price was    49.I then traveled out to the park and tried to buy tickets at the gate where the sales assistant told me the ticket price was now    79 and that the    49 was only available online. I asked them to show me where on the Disneyland Paris website it states that the price at the gate was    79 which they were unable to do.I complained and asked to speak to a supervisor which they begrudgingly allowed me to do so after making me wait 30 mins. The supervisor stated that the    79 ticket price was not advertised anywhere and never would be. I then suggested to the supervisor that by failing to advertise the    79 price, Disneyland Paris was breaching the European Union's directive regarding misleading advertising practices. The supervisor's response was that I should sue Disneyland then.I asked the supervisor if he was happy for me to post the fact that he had suggested I sue Disneyland on TripAdvisor? After this he became very defensive and quiet and refused to speak to me anymore.Long story short, if you are going to Disneyland Paris make sure you buy your tickets online, at least one day in advance and preferably from a third party provider (we ended up coming back the next day and paid only    45 from a company online, even cheaper than Disneyland was offering).",1
"Hour long Queues: For a majority of the rides there was an hour (sometimes even more) long queue.   For your customers that only stay in Disneyland for a day or two, this is quite a big issue as it means we have less time to fully enjoy Disneyland. FastPass: This is especially frustrating when it is virtually impossible to utilise the FastPass. You had to get to the ride you wanted first thing to book everything in advance rather than just queue in the FastPass lane like you would in any other theme park (why would you go to a ride, to then go away and come back?). Despite showing up very early all the rides were booked out too quickly by the time we got to them, so we diddon't actually get to use this even once!Magic Hours and  Technical Difficulties : The above points pretty much ruined our first day in Disneyland, but we had hopes for the morning with the  magic hours  we were promised in our package deal. We were told that this gets 2 extra hours in the park before it becomes open to the public, however, our hotel receptionist informed us that this was in fact only 1hour 30 mins. Every minute counts in Disneyland and I've been waiting to get to Disneyland all my life, but we let it slide.... We head over to the rides that are supposed to be open at this time: Rock 'N' Roller and Ratatouille, but both are facing  technical difficulties  and diddon't expect to be open until 10am   coincidentally the normal park opening time. At this point, we feel pretty upset, as we know that as soon as the park officially opens, there are going to be hour long queues all over again for rides that last a maximum of 7 minutes and an average of probably under 1 minute. But as we make our way around the park, at 9:30 we stumble across a reasonably long queue for Pirates of The Carribean, due to open in 30 minutes. We decide to queue whilst it's short and hope for a 40 minute queue tops (considering it doesdon't open until 10am anyway). After 35 minutes of queueing   people from the queue in front of us begin randomly dispersing. We go to ask a staff member at the front what happened, and the answer? Technical difficulties YET.AGAIN. We rush over to the park train in hopes that we havedon't missed our last chance of getting into a shorter queue before the crowds come out in full force, but of course, they already have. We suck it up, accept our fate, and wait... A train arrives. It's pretty packed but there are a few spaces here and there. They could probably take about a quarter of our queue. Wrong. The Disney staff havedon't even opened the gate for us to line up at each carriage and before you know it, the train leaves. No one from our queue had boarded. Better luck on the next train. Another hour long queue in the freezing cold. Food: Table service restaurants:  but you dodon't have a reservation? Sorry, we dodon't have any tables left.  How can you fail to raise awareness of this? Had I been made aware of this at the time of booking I would have even made a deposit if I had known how difficult it was to simply get some food. There's no option of reserving online at all   you literally have to go to the restaurant itself to make a reservation   how would first time visitors know this? After being turned away by all of your table service restaurants, we tried to order just anything from a self service fast food restaurant, with queues as long as they were for the attractions and with nowhere to sit unless you sat outside... unheard of. Disney Characters: We only spotted 4 characters the entire time we were there   not including the parades   which doesdon't really count as I coulddon't see them, being right at the back of the crowd which began to form around an hour before the parade started, making it impossible to do anything, really... As with everything getting a photograph taken is also an hour long queue. Overall it really diddon't feel like it was Disneyland at all. It felt more like a general theme park or even a pop up funfair during half  term with the only exception being the Disney illuminations. After complaining to Disneyland, they offered us free park tickets, which is an absolute joke as I woulddon't go back to relive the above if they paid me. When we refused the free park tickets, they diddon't even refund us the price of 1 adult, 2 day 2 park ticket. Money Money Money is all they care about.",1
"I have purchased my tickets 6J084068 to disney in September, the day after I purchased the ticket I received a mail saying the tickets are cancelled. Immediately I called Disney and checked why it was cancelled as there was not clear reason and it was mentioned my money will be refunded. After few days I called it was mentioned it was due to some issue with the bank , so I called the bank to clarify but everything was ok at bank side, then I called back to Disney to inform the same. Then service desk confirmed that I will received my money in few days. After one month I called again to check the status of refund, I was told this was still under investigation. I had to make multiple calls and multiple mails to Disney to get single information. then I received a call saying there was some confusion. The ticket that was cancelled was wrong transaction and the reference number is different and there exist a ticket valid for one year for me. Have they told me earlier I wouldn   t have to waste my time following up with service desk and the people in service desk time as well. Due to this mis communication from service desk, we all wasted a lot of time. After that I checked the tickets mentioned by the service desk , I saw the tickets are not valid anymore, it was valid only till October 2017 . Now I again called to service desk , they said they cannot help me anymore . I don   t understand here, there was miscommunication from Disney side that my tickets are cancelled and I had to spend so much time and money to call Disney and mail them and follow up with bank and all and the worst part is the tickets are also not valid any more . I was just given this email to contact. That means I am losing my money , my tickets to Disney , opportunity to visit Disney . I would never have expected this service from Disney .",1
"I'm in a wheelchair and need a companion to push me around the park and tend to my personal needs, so I brought my husband along for that role. The park refused, saying that because he also has a disability he was  not fit and proper to be a companion .",1
"En Fran  ais cela s' appelle  se faire tondre la laine sur le dos  which basically means they will get until the last nickel in your pocket!!!!It is a gross exploitation of infancyOf course winter is not the best time to enjoy any amusement park in France, you cannot compare with the weather in Florida or California but its does not change that it is a vulgar trap",1
"My parents bought this trip for myself, my husband and our 2 year old daughter. I have never been to Disneyland Paris but I have been to Florida twice. I must say I cant believe how disappointed I was with Paris, the people were so rude and unhelpful and the organisation was ridiculous. 2 hours to queue to see the princesses with a two year old is so bad! The cherry on the top was New Year   s Eve night, we had to pay for tickets for the night even though we had day tickets. My mum who is nearly 60 and is registered disabled as she is riddled with osteoarthritis wanted to lean up against the fence as there was no seating, we managed to find a spot by the front of the castle to watch the fire works baring in mind we have been here in this spot since 8pm. Around 10.30pm some members of staff came along and put a rope around the centre of the circle for disabled people, we were not in the circle we were outside of it. Then all of a sudden the staff members decided that they had put the rope in the wrong place and wanted to section off the whole of the space in front of the castle and now wanted us to move into a crowd of 1000   s of people, we refused and explained that we had been here since 8pm and this should have been sectioned off earlier. They then sent their security to us and there was 5 massive men standing around us baring in mind by 2 year old daughter was there in her pram, they made us move and get crushed into the crowd. Now I totally appreciate that there needs to be a section for disabled customers but here are my questions. 1. Why was this not sectioned off earlier? As they shut the park at 5 and the reopened, so why was this not set up before people came back in? 2. Why was the rope put in the wrong place to start with? And 3. Why on earth did it take 5 big security men to stand around us and intimidate us when my small child was there?. I can   t honestly say I will never ever go back to Disneyland Paris I would rather save for 5 years and go to Florida then go back there.",1
"I would like to start by stating that I have never been to prison but I imagine it would feel the same. So you get to the park entrance by car at 8.30 and only half of the pay desks for your rip off 20euro carpark ticket are open and the queue is HUGE. At least 75 cars. The walk through gates aredon't too bad if you dodon't take a bag but get ready to empty your pockets . .Dodon't faff about holding people up by trying to go through a  no bag  queue with a bag!!!! Then you rush to get your first  Fast pass  ticket, the time being 9.10am okay, the park only open for just over an hour remember. The ticket time was 11.10am. So, time to go and do a couple of rides right?? WRONG. You get to your first queue to see that its 90mins long. . .How can a queue be 90mins long when the park has only been open for 60mins??? Oh, thats right, because they only run one car for an hour so the queue builds up and you have to be there for two days not one, how silly of me!!!! And that was how the day went on, even a half hour queue for a disgusting soggy cold crepe'. Next day (knowing how long the queues would be and getting two day tickets) we got to the entrance at 8.10am to find, yep, you've guessed it, TWO gates open . . .And about 50 cars queuing. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PS, the rides were okay.",1
More like slow pass !!! To give an idea of how this works . You scan your fast pass and it books a time slot about 4 hours in the future meaning you would have to walk to every big ride around 8 miles scan your ticket at every one and then go back again .. which is not possible and expensive . Average que time is 70 minutes . Con waste of money ,1
"I would like to start with the recommendations. If you like to spend your days in line waiting, with a big crowd of people around you. This is the place for you. But if you are like me. This is hell on earth. First you stay in line to pay 300 euro for a family of 4. Then you need to use the rest of the day in line in front of the burger joints,toilettes, obscure attractions, and even the smallest coffee shops. I did know what I was facing going into this hell hole. But it was even worse then I did imagine. My recommendation is to keep away. Do something else with your kids visiting Paris.",1
"While Disneyland is a place for kids, there are adults everywhere smoking. Smoking vaping in designated area is not enforced. Kids near smoke everywhere. If you want your kids to breathe in second hand smoke, this is the place to be. The smoking spoilt the whole Disneyland experience. It is disappointing. I expected more.",1
"Last Saturday evening we had fast pass tickets to see Peter Pan from 7.40pm 8.10pm. We got to the ride at 7.38pm. There was a handful of people in the fast track queue. It was raining, we couldn   t see anyone at the start of the area so went under rope. Then a Disney employees ran and shouted at us to go to the front of the way in. Her manner was so rude and confrontational. We showed our tickets and she said we had to wait. There was no one else there and it was raining. But apparently we had to wait two minutes. When my clock turned to 7.40 we went to the front of the way in. She shouted literally it wasn   t time yet. I showed her my iPhone with the correct time on, she waved her watch in front of my face saying her watch was right. I said my clock was correct. She then shouted more irrelevant things. She can right up to my face in front of loads of people in the line for Peter Pan. People were turning round because of her shouting. I then said I was going to talk to her manager about her behaviour. She then grabbed her badge and waved that in front of my face and spelt out her name in her shouting voice as well. She looked so unprofessional, rude and nasty. She should not be working with the public, with that attitude. She was rude to people on another ride the night before. We were a family of 5 and she treated us like absolutely rubbish. We have been twice this year to Disneyland Paris and overall 9 times and have never ever been treated or spoke to this way. I have the persons name if Disney would like to know this information. She certainly doesn   t have the Disney spirit all the other employees possess. ",1
"What has happened to Disney???I   ve been 18 times and this is the worst time ever. Staff are rude, look like they do not want to be there. Unhelpful and snappy. Not acting like they used to with the kids. The first time I went Disney was 10 years ago and have been nearly twice a year since. Not going to bother next year, gone completely down hill. Met another family and they were saying they had nearly just had their bag pinched and another family that said it   s awful! Hotel Cheyenne is absolutely freezing including the water! Slept with our coats over blankets. Despite no sleep the staff just don   t care. Breakfast we had to get from Disney village and my god it was awful",1
"For Haloween we returned for the 5th time in the last years at Disney Park and we were very disapointed.After ONE HOUR AND A HALF staying in line for Thunder Mountain we were kindly invited to go out because of mecanical problems. The same happened at White Snow. At 5h30 pm every attraction stopped working because it was getting dark.A huge crowd of people, so we have to wait half an hour to pass the security check point and one hour to buy the tickets, because only two cashiers was working. All in one, in 5 hours we made only two roller coasters. It cost us of 80    per person the entry and 63    4 hot dogs and sodas! This it was the scum of my life, really. An American bussiness managed by french sindicalists. A real shame.Never return there again.",1
"Everytime something happened to make us happy something else came along to wipe the smile off our face. Open the park at 7.45 a.m.   ok, diddon't want that at breakfas time but o, then keep all of the rides closed until 9.30 (except for the really young stuff; teapot rides etc.) then when you've wied all that time and the rope comes away at 9.30 they keep you waiting behind another rope until 9.50 all with a kind of 'what did you expect' kind of arrogance. The shops constantly miss represent prices and offer false deals and we saw smallprint within small print  yes it is that messed up. Just one long string of disappointments. I cadon't tell you what a horrible experience this was   I feel disgusted.",1
"Tries to look the same , but it's all smaller and a little more cramped .After having been to Florida 3 times Paris comes across as a cheap copy of the real thing . Could prob do in 1 day , 2 days and you would start getting bored .Disney Florida is Disney Disney Paris is a theme park !",1
"We have just returned from 3 days in Disneyland and before reading this, please note that we did not fall out with anyone   so my comments are not tinged with bitterness   and we went with moderate expectations. Also the hordes of revellers seemed never ending so I am clearly in the minority:Disney Corporation's 'magic' is biased towards shareholders. I have too many examples of poor organisation, rudeness and cynical exploitation on the part of Disney Corporation to shake as many Euros out of us as possible. As the main beneficiaries are children and Disney inspired childhoods, visitors seem happy to keep opening wallets and purses for over priced food, drink, activities (were there is a service.... there is a price tag). What struck me most were the queues (to be expected) but also the lack of joy as families milled throughout the park. The exception was the immediate adrenalin after (finally) finishing a ride but the 1 2 minutes of each ride was tarnished by the minimum 30 minute queue, whilst Disney Corporation allows in as many visitors as it can to keep the tills ringing. This exploitative model will become less popular and the magic, I am sure, will tarnish for other visitors unless Disney Corporation recognises that, like other businesses, it needs to change for the better.Such a huge disappointment and, whilst a 1 star rating seems miserly on my part   especially as the family made the most of being together (which is the point, of course)   I cadon't bring myself to offering more!",1
"We came 10 years ago for the 15th anniversary and thought we would come back for the 25th because it was so lovely...we made a mistake! It's dated, the rides have broken down constantly, the Halloween party was terribly themed (We heard others complaining about this too), The lines are so long you end up walking round doing pretty much nothing all day because they have zero crowd control here. The 25th anniversary is nowhere near as good as the 15th they have just stuck some projections on the castle and there are very little fireworks (good money saving effort Disney!) Needless to say we will never come back again which is a shame because 10 years ago it was Magical and a lot more effort was made by Disney. I'm sure kids will love it here but in my opinion Florida is a much better option and is not much different in price by the time Disneyland Paris has ripped every euro from you.",1
"I dont normally give a  terrible  but I thought it was disgraceful that the park closed 3 hours early on the 31st October for a Halloween event that required additional payment No warning of this was given of this anywhere on the website, including when we bought the tickets and the hours were consistently given everywhere as closing at 10. I only found out when I check the park hours for that specific day The tickets were already peak price and no reduction or compensation was made. I wrote a letter of complaint and recieved no reply...great service! The terrible rating is, in part because I habe a right to a response to a well written and reasonable complaint.But the reality is generallity not good. It is true  the queues really are awful . The reason you have to wait 40 minutes an hour for a 2 minute ride is that Disney packs too many people into a park where there are simply not enough activities and rides. How people find enough to do for more than one day I do not know, even with hours spent queuing. Space Mountain shut down for most of the day and Ratatouille broke down when were on it. The unrelenting and aggressive merchandising is soul destroying  like being trapped in a huge theme shopping mall with a few over packed rides. The food is extortionate.My day was Ok I was with two teen kids so they were open minded, not demanding constant food and toys. But with little kids getting tired, bored and demanding things I think this would be unrelentingly awful and painfully expensive.My advice is very clear to people  either go completely off season (with your sandwiches packed) or go somewhere else   there is a very nice park in Netherlands that I dont want everyone to know about but I gave it 5 stars",1
"First Disney theme park experience and probably never to be repeated. For the amount of people visiting each day there are not enough actual rides so queues quickly stretch to over an hour. Fast pass helps a bit but still spent at least 80% of the time queuing and 15% of the time walking from one part to another. In total over 2 days went on about 13 rides across Disneyland and Disney Studios, so approx EUR 11   person   ride. Also because of the crowds, difficult to get onto wifi and even 4G. Expensive food and you inevitably have to queue even for the restaurants. Would advise any family to forget rip off Paris and rip off Disney and head to another city park (e.g. Europa Park in Germany, which is half the price, has far more and much better rides, and as a result you spend less time queueing). ",1
"Not for American's who like Disneyland or Disney World. We went to Disneyland Paris in September 2017. It was suppose to be open until 8:30 PM, which gave us 4 hours in the park. The parade was our first major disappointment. Next, we decided to visit some attractions. Whole areas of the park were closed, forcing the oversold crowds to the few existing attractions. Lines were overwhelming and the fast passes were no longer being issued. Nothing seemed to be of Disney's high standards. We decided to salvage our visit by going to a restaurant or getting food of any kind. Everything was closed. It was expensive and not worth the drive to get there. Dodon't go if you're American and have been to any of Disney's American Theme parks. You will be disappointed.",1
"Attended for short break at end of school holidays. Paid a lot for the break and added extra to have a uprated room in newport hotel and  full board  plus meal plan. The hotel was nice but the room it's self was shocking. Very dated, basic and run down, at a push 2* at most and I'm hardly fussy. Spoke to staff who said theyre all the same! Food plan was far to complicated. Breakfast was a joke, then hard to find somewhere to eat without reservations and no menus to pre plan and with a very fussy child it was impossible! Then the park. So over crowded it was a joke. All about generating revenue rather than an experience. Coulddon't see the shows or attractions and ride waiting times of over 70minutes!! A place aimed at children how on earth do they see this as acceptable? My boys are good but like me anything over 30mins takes its toll. First day we achieved around 4 rides!! I know companies like to earn a profit but at the customers cost? I could understand if it was   20 a day but it's well over that!! We were all disappointed about the trip, the boys talk more about the ferry trip over than the holiday!! And to top it off, 4 emails later and still not even an acknowledgement!! Added to this still no response to the two emails I sent before the trip. It's clear they're all about profit and not an experience for customers. Save your cash as make your own entertainment!!",1
"The food is dismal and the eating facilities are depressingly bad fast food venues reminiscant of 1984esque eating halls designed to make McDonald's seem warm and romantic. Choose between this and outrageously expensive sit down restaurant where you are not warned how long you can expect to wait, but we diddon't.The only thing that is brilliant about this attraction park is the cynicism with which it was designed. Tickets are so expensive that visitors are determined to get their money's worth, leading them to roam the park in search of elusive satisfaction and spending even more money on ubiquitous t shirts, mugs and cuddly toys. The rides, when you find them, warn you that you have to queue for 50 minutes unless you take a fast pass   which tells you to come back three hours later, leaving you more time to wander hopelessly and buy more souvenirs. Save your money. Go to Europapark.",1
"Why why why. Very poor break in 2015. You offer a return break for your 25 years free over night stay and 2 passes. Been to DLP 6 times. 2015 so much closed. So we take the offer up book for November 2017. Send in the requested booking details asked in letter to book extra night. Get a email reply please book extra night on our reservation number. Call up hotel fully booked so we book another hotel on DLP complex. Sent email back with details, get email back are we sure we wish to move hotels. Replied yes the same day. Got Email back 10 days later sorry fully booked in that hotel. Holding Mr breath after 6 emails back and forwards since August still waiting. So check in one hotel to check out next day to check into another hotel. Come on DLP. You have no guest care at all. We havedon't even made it back to you yet and already disappointed. Called your reservations to be told you get 4000 E mails a day and not even a contact number to call you on.",1
"Pros: nice scenary.Cons: extremely crouded; at least five attractions experienced technical problems; extremely long wait (aprox 1 hour) for small children to meet classic characters like Mickey & friends, the princesses (why aredon't they walking the streets of the parc, like they used to???); the attractions are totally outdated, the same as 20 years ago.Overall, very expensive for what it offers, really frustrating and big chances of dissapointing your child if he she's main goal is to meat their favourite characters.",1
"Too little rides, too many people, too long waiting times. And that on a monday. I cant imagine the horror in the weekends! Total disappointment. First and last time here.",1
"Before whipping out your credit card to pay for Disneyland Paris entrance tickets, make sure that you understand what you are buying. If you make a mistake, or misunderstand something about your purchase, DISNEYLAND PARIS has absolutely no interest in assisting customers with refunds. In fact, their customer support is so pathetic that you probably wodon't receive a reply to your emails and calling them does not help either. Disney should be ashamed of the ticket policies at Disneyland Paris!On 29 September 2017, I purchase three tickets and cancellation insurance online for 200Euros through Disneyland Paris's ticket agent, Ticketmaster.fr. When arriving at the park, I was informed at the entrance gate that there was an error on my tickets and that they were only valid for the following day. I was told that I have to buy new tickets and that I would be able to claim a refund for the unused tickets online. So thinking that Disney is a reputable company, and that I had ticket insurance through their online agent, I went ahead and purchased another three tickets   this time for 252 Euros. So I had now spent 452 Euros for three tickets into Disneyland Paris.This was ten days ago and even though I have tried many times via email and telephone calls to get a response from Disneyland Paris and Ticketmaster.fr and Mondial Assistance.fr (the ticket insurers), I have had absolutely no response. We went to considerable expense to get to France in the first place, and then to be ripped off by Disneyland is simply disgusting! Although we loved Paris and the many, many things that it has to offer, Disneyland Paris was a complete low point and extremely disappointing. Disneyland Paris is completely over rated and extremely over priced! Rather take your kids to the Louvre   Notre Dame   Versailles   a lot more educational and you wodon't get ripped off on tickets either. Such a waste of time and money.",1
While park and ride was ok .. Met a v rude staff managing the parade .. totally shocked.. wodon't recommend this park,1
"We were prepared for the lines and ques, well we thought. Way too many people for the available services. It was actually a safety issue with this many people in the Park. Restaurants were closed leaving food lines just as bad as the rides. All the fast track rides had run out of tickets by 1pm   2pm leaving nothing but ques for everything. For 100 euro I'll go find something else to do. We had planned to visit the Parks in California and Florida but that wodon't be happening. :(",1
"It all feels like a scam. You pay an absurd amount of money to stand in queues for 45 minutes (for a 1.43 minute ride). You spend the whole day standing and waiting, and then the rides, the food and the activities are below average. The park seems to allow an unlimited people into the park and that is their only objective; making money out of people with children who then feel completely cheated. Everything is expensive, the food is average at best. You spend nine hours in the park and maybe get to five rides. You wait 45 minutes to meet some of the characters and then you are told that they need to take a break and the kids never get to meet the characters. It only does not feel like a scam, it is a scam.",1
Dreadful place. Overpriced overcrowded and surely French staff in the restaurants. Go to America if you want the Disney adventure. Food was atrocious I mean truest dreadful.,1
"I visited this park in 2014 and had a great time. In March 2017, I had a miserable day at this park. The place was packed with people. Waited in line at restrooms for over twenty minutes in the area by the Peter Pan ride. Food lines were insane probably 45 minutes. We had park hopper passes, so we went over to the studios side late in the afternoon to hopefully find some food lines that weredon't so long. We were unsuccessful and they were shutting down some of the restaurants for the day. We eventually found an indoor restaurant near the Buzz Light Year ride that had shorter lines. I think I rode 4 rides all day long. Wait times were way too long and we were only able to get a few of the reserved time passes. We did go to a few shows including the finale, which is the best thing in the park. My experience in the 2014 was totally different. We rode almost every ride in the park and had no problem finding food or using the restrooms quickly. It seems they diddon't have enough staff the second time around. I will not return. It seems like Disney is not concerned about their guests' experiences.",1
"A total disappointment... waste of money. We were in the Ist batch to enter the park, I have toddler so height restriction made us to visit the rides that suites him.. but after one hour,.. its queue of minimum 45 minutes wait, moving ahead we saw, 75minutes wait for other rides, 90 minutes is too long to wait and take a picture with Mr. Mickey,.. Too much crowed and we diddon't enjoy much,..we returned to our hotel in Paris by 1:30pm,.. our excitement diddon't last long :(Be prepared for a long wait for lunch or breakfast if you diddon't reserve one.",1
"I was extremely excited to spend the day in my dream theme park, however i was sadly disappointed. Out of the 7 hours that i was in the theme park, 5 of those were spent in extremely long lines!! Wait time for the main rides was around 60 80 minutes long. It also took 40 minutes just to get through the main gates due to 1 person checking bags!!! Ridiculous. For a park that is celebrating 25 years you would think they would have it better managed. And there was no notice that one of the main rides was down for maintenance! We also spent 60 minutes in a line only to get to the front and then be told it is closed due to a fault. Absolute waist of time and money.",1
"I'm a big fan of Disney (superb in Florida) but found staff at the Paris park lacking in service, nasty and they seem to forget who the customer is. I think that they should receive some extra training to be anything like the US parks. The food is expensive and dodon't bother with the extra hours or annual passes which are restricted to a small part of the park. Shame really.",1
"Disney fan at heart and have visited Disneyland in Hong Kong several times, so this review is a comparison between the two. Entering is chaotic and security personnel are just straight out rude and lack basic manners. When you are filled with excitement and joy visiting Disney, this is not what you'd expect to be greeted with. Lack of variety in merchandise within the stores, where the majority of goods are aimed at young children. Not much option or choice for adults. Despite visiting the park upon opening, the restrooms were on the poor side in terms of hygiene. The park is definitely bigger than Disney Hong Kong and offers more variety in rides. With that however, comes longer lines and wait times which is to be expected. For a quick meal you have a small range to choose from and are pre prepared so expect your food to be on the colder side. Hotter and  fresher  foods are available but after looking at reviews they either tend to be located within the Disney hotel or not worth the hefty price. ",1
The park was really nice with lots to offer. Unfortunately visiting the park during peak summer season is really insane. The lines are really long averaging a one hour wait. Even though all of the amenities and service provided are top notch you will will not get to enjoy it because of the huge masses of people in the park. Visiting the park during off season is a whole different kind of story.,1
"As avid Disneyland fans we have been numerous times over the last 20 years. Celebrating our daughters 18th birthday this year we chose the hotel New York and were excited at the 25th anniversary free half board upgrades. There was very little information available on the half board options until we checked in, where you finally find out all the 'cans and cannots'. Got there to find our breakfast had to be taken at cafe Hyperion in the park   if we wanted breakfast in our own hotel it was over   50 a day supplement! Ok, so we head over the the cafe, voucher in hand, queue like cattle for half an hour, to be given this disgusting, rubbery 'omelette burger' and dry, stale croissants. So much for a 'free upgrade'. More like a stab in the back downgrade. And the half board dinner vouchers, well of course everywhere is fully booked (they diddon't ask tell me to book restaurants when I spent half hour on the phone to them booking our holiday). So now we're here all we can get is fast food, which is ridiculously overpriced and pretty revolting, again   thanks for the free 'upgrade'. In order to convince one you are getting free special upgrade offers they've downgraded all the services so if you want the standard you've been used to in the park, you've got to pay more whilst you're here. Sneaky, callous and underhand way of making more money and getting people through the door. Absolutely disgusted, Disney. In our twenty years of coming here we have never been treated so poorly. ",1
"This was something that my parents planned for my family and I on holiday abroad. We all became very excited, especially my little sister. The parade was cancelled and lots of the rides were shut down due to rain. There wasdon't a lot of really thrilling rides. I have to say that it is very publicised and rude that the customer services dodon't come back to you about any queries. The queues are terribly long and not worth waiting for. I was extremely disappointed.",1
"From start to finish, this place is hell! AVOID! Here's a flavour of our day... Bossy parking attendant chased after us and shouted at us when we tried to park at the end of the row instead of the middle, where he then ordered us to park. Long walk from the car park with several of the travelators not working. Surly security guard closed the bag check for no reason just as we reached the front (having queued for 15 minutes)   caused chaos as the whole queue then had to merge with the adjacent queue. Smokers everywhere ignoring the no smoking signs and no one making them stop. The breakfast vouchers we were given were only valid in one restaurant (the other one was closed even though it was peak season). They closed a third of the tills just as we arrived, no doubt just to make sure that everyone could queue that bit longer. Badly organised service meant a 30 minute wait for an 'omelette burger' and a stale croissant. Massive queues for everything, even the smaller children's rides. Several of the 'big' rides broken down for long periods of time with no explanation. A 70 minute wait in hot sunshine for one ride. Nothing, absolutely nothing, to amuse the children while you're in the queue. The FastPass tickets are a joke   if you dodon't get them as soon as you arrive, forget it! We tried at 11.30am and the next available ticket was for 6.30pm. Hopeless, and definitely not fast. Nearly 60 euros for four burgers and chips. Hardly a sign of any Disney characters all day. Daisy Duck and the Genie from Aladdin   not what you expect from the ads. And the worst thing of all   we'd booked for 3 days, so we knew we had to come back and do it all again! We hid our massive disappointment from the children, but even they asked why it took so long so that they'd only been on 3 rides during the whole day. In our opinion, the whole place is just one massive badly organised shopping mall selling overpriced tat. If you want to shop, eat expensive junk food or stand in hot smoky queues for hours on end, then this is the place for you. If not, give it a miss. We're NEVER EVER going back.",1
Do the maths complete con spend all day in a que for rides last 2 mins too busy ....upsetting for children !!,1
Park is as you would expect. Well themed with lots to do. Good fastpass system. You are advised not to bring your own food but I queued for 40 minutes in one of their 'fast' food restaurants. This is really unacceptable and seemed to be down to inefficiencies in the process. I recommend bringing food with you. Maybe this isdon't normal but it is unacceptable. ,1
"My partner and I are about to jet off to Universal Studios in Florida, and the excitement I feel at going back to that wonderful place reminded me that I haddon't left a review for our stay at DLP earlier this year. We went for the Star Wars: Season of the Force celebration, having booked two days, and were initially excited. When we arrived, that quickly vanished. Where to begin? The queues to actually get TO the entrance were unreal. No order, just a huge bottleneck of people funnelling through a couple of metal detectors. When we finally got through there, we discovered another queue, this time to actually get into the park. A WHILE later, we made it inside, and decided to have a bite to eat. Sadly, there wasdon't really anywhere to sit and do that that wasdon't already swamped with people, so we had to order counter service and basically sit on the floor. With that out of the way, it was on to the rides! Well, it would have been if there had been any with a less than 2 hour wait time. I gave DLP one star because the Aerosmith coaster and Tower of Terror were actually very good, when you actually got through the massive queues. As a huge Star Wars fan, I was looking forward to the show, however. That, and the sci fi themed area of the park. This part, however, was basically closed. Just let that sink in for a moment   They were putting on a STAR WARS celebration, and their Star Wars rides were closed. We nearly missed the show on the first day, because we asked about it at one of the information kiosks, only to be shrugged at vaguely because neither of us spoke French, and they apparently diddon't speak any English. I should stress that the show itself was great, and salvaged the weekend for us. Sadly, I did not get a photograph with the  squad of stormtroopers  that we were promised would be patrolling throughout the day (2 guys showed up every hour or so, and were immediately swamped by people), and over the course of the weekend, we managed to get onto maybe 7 rides. And now you see why I am so excited to be going back to Universal, where they do everything so very much better. We'll stick to that in future, and wodon't be repeating our trip back to this badly run park. But hey, if you like massive queues and closed rides, this might be the place for you!",1
"Spent the last two days at Disneyland Paris. Totally shocked by the experience. Majority of the best rides did not work. Space Mountain, Indiana Jones and Thunder Mountain all with  technical issues . Huge waiting times which often resulted in the ride being closed before one got a chance to go on it. Sheep like crowds prepared to accept the worst possible experience. To cap it all off many of the staff that work here dodon't seem to get the Disney brand they are supposed to be ambassadors for. Totally clueless and unhelpful. Seem to take pleasure in informing you of difficulties. No investment for last ten years, peeling paint, old rides and total lack of magic in the park. Cadon't understand how Disney can let 14 million people endure this every year. I would write to the Chief Executive if there was any point to save people this. He wodon't read it as he is too smart to visit the park with his family. The only saving grace is that in 5 years time the place wodon't exist as it will go out of business. ",1
Visited when it rained in the morning only lace to shelter is the shops.. None of the character s we're available. Parades shows were cancelled or delayed so long that ckids got bored. Biggest waste of money. Go to a non Disney theme park that has decent rides. Kids will have a better day,1
"I visited Disney Paris in 2001, 2005 and last month. Nothing new since my last visit. Same old technology, same attractions. Even the 3D movie (star wars) is still the same. That was somthing interesting 10 years ago but you can find the same now at you local village shopping mall. The queues are still long enough to kill the day. But you end up with an old fashioned attraction. They made no investment since my last visit 12 years ago. But they added a lot of new shops selling chineese Disney stuff for a fortune. On the day of our visit there was rain and they cancelled the shows at the last minutes without acknowledging visitors waiting for hours under the rain. Meanwhile they sold thousands of raincoats (for 10 EURs which you may find for 3 4 Euros at the city)....It was a promise that I gave to my doughter to visit Disneyland but was really not the place I visited 12 years ago (or it was exactly the same old place but shouddon't be)...I believe that there are much more interesting amusement parks in Europe and this place is just targeting to get as much money as they can from you...",1
Came specifically for the Jedi training academy for the kids who had been hugely excited all week about it to be told it's fully booked for the day by 11am. Got here at 10am but an hour to get through security etc.  Really disappointed,1
"Crowded is not the enough to describe this place! Once you see the waiting times all the magic is GONE, nothing less than 55 minutos. People smoking EVERYWHERE. Fast passes are nothing but Fast since you can only get one at the time and you have to go to the ride walking to get it. The magical day we waited for was waiting in lines the whole day!! Another thing is that during the day Many attractions are  temporary closed  nobody knows why... Seeing the Pink castle was a dream come true but still never going back! I dodon't understand why DISNEY as a brand allows this kind of things. ",1
"Very buisy in august dodon't get chance to do many things.Rides closed when it rained so two days out of our trip no rides for us.We diddon't see any princesses in four days and the lights show was on at 11pm meaning that after a day at the park our four and eight year olds was far to tierd to stay in the park till 11pm or get on a bus and travel that late at night.Also fast track is a con.We tried to fast track a ride at 10am,it told us to come back at 3pm.by round about this time fast track offer closes meaning you can only fast track 1 ride all day.We would never go back and I would say it was the worst holiday a family of six as ever had.",1
"Very few rides, huge queues and just loads of rip off shops selling junk. Nothing compared to Disneyland in the U.S.",1
"Having seen the universal studios in LA, we went with great expectations to the Disney Studios and Disneyland Park in Paris. We went on a Monday to avoid crowds but it was not only overcrowded, some of their rides failed after our waiting in line for more than 90 minutes. The staff are overwhelmed and under pressure, no one was polite. Came back disappointed, having wasted a prescious day in Paris.The park is mismanaged. It is evident from the fact that they dodon't restrict entry when excessive tickets are sold out. We could only take one ride between 10:30am and 5:30pm, due to the long lines and failures in between. We wanted to give feedback and demand a refund (something we havedon't done in years) but the line at the city hall way stop long and the lady at the gate rudely refused to hear us.I would recommend no one should ever go there.",1
"You're better off going to Nigloland, I'll explain why.From the moment you get into the parking area it is all highly regulated, draconian and not really family friendly at all. The parking is expensive and very far away from the entrance. The parking attendants make sure they direct you to the furthest part too! We arrived at 9am in the parking and got into the park only just before 10am. We then had to wait for priority guests till after 10am. By then the crush was so huge that my 6 year old daughter got banged and crushed several times. We kept getting seperated as a family by people pushing in and pushing us out of the way. My 6year old got banged so many times during the day she left with several bruises on her head one from a turnstyle that hit her as she went through it and the rest of the time from other guests!We struggled to find a toilet for her that diddon't have less than a 10minute wait. There are no family toilets. she was so desperate at one stage that my husband had to take her into the men's toilet. There was another dad in the men's toilet with his daughter in the same predicament.Resting and seating areas were very clogged up so we struggled to find anywhere to sit down as a family for a water break. All the seating is for the overpriced restaurants designed to make you spend more money on the disney machine.Some of the staff were extremely rude. One of the staff members actually caused me to fall over by openening a gate I was leaning on to tie me shoe lace. He coulddon't even wait for 10seconds for me just to finish. He just opened the gate causing me to fall down, no apologies but just a very bad attitude!The indication for waiting times for rides are wildly optimistic! Autopia said the wait was 45mins on their board but my daughter was kept waiting almost 75mins no chance of leaving if she needed to go to the toilet urgently.The fast passes are not really that helpful once you get one you cannot get another one until you have done the previous one. Usually they are several hours away. After 6 7pm you cannot even get one and again only priority guests are allowed in on fast pass! It's not even worth buying the super fast pass as there are only 7 rides you can you use in disneyland park.I gave disneyland park a star because some of the rides are good, and my teenage son enjoyed them but in the evening we got stuck on rides in the middle of several rides. There was a distraught child crying on one of the rides that got stuck.When we left with a our very exhausted children we were purposefully directed through the disney village with al their shops and restaurants which are designed to make you spend more money with disney. We got completely lost trying to find the parking lot and ended up having to go almost back to the park. No staff there to help you find your way out, no sign posts. Only a rude man on one of the other entrances who was explaining in French so we coulddon't understand him to other lost guests that we had to go all the way back through the disney village to find the parking again! My daughter's last words were whilst in tears was 'I hate this place!' Is this the impression disneyland wanted to leave her with?If you are willing to spend the money there are ways the disney machine gives you priority but it's not about giving everyone a magical experience. For that you have to be willing pay quite alot of money!I did give it a star as some of the rides are very good, but you spend most of the times in a queue and very little time on the rides. So in truth Disney diddon't make my daughter or my family's dreams come true. She had brief bursts of excitement amid long periods of boredom frustration and claustrophobia. It's a nightmare we wodon't be returning to in a hurry. You're better off going to Nigloland if you are in this area.",1
"Disappointing day at Disneyland in Paris! The park was absolutely heaving! The queues where unbearable! I queued with my 6 year old son for 1 hour 20 mins to be turned away 5 people from the front due to a technical fault! Nothing they can do of course...but we could have been given a extra fast pass ticket or something to make up for this! But no nothing just turned away!! The fast pass stopped at 4pm, many rides had stopped taking people around 530 6pm. We got fast pass for thunder mountain at 10.30am when we arrived and our ride time was......18.40 so rest of the day we could only have one more fast pass reserved! We only saw 1 Disney character the whole time we where there, which was the most disappointing to be honest! No atmosphere! Was rubbish! Their photo pass is shocking! Dodon't waste your money on it!    18 for 1 picture! We had 4 pics taken and not one of them included the whole family even though they where all on the ride!  badThe shop was ridiculously priced, along with the food and drinks! But is to be expected in these places! But I queued for 30 mins to pay    50 for 2 adults and 2 kids very basic meals! I had a chicken burger, fried chicken but it had been sitting that long the underneath of the chicken was white and soggy! (That for me is not ok though) The park itself is beautiful, we got some lovely photos of our own but other than that was very unimpressed and felt let down! The adverts make this place looks amazing and it's just not! I wrote a email of complaint to Eurodisney to which I have had no reply as of yet but it's early days! ",1
"We have visited here 6 or 7 times over the past 10 years and have always had a great day with the kids.We visited two days ago in August peak season. Never again. The quality goes well and truly out of the window whilst the focus is to cram as many people possible into the park and make as much money as they can. Waiting for an hour in queues with young children is not fun. The enjoyment of the day was completely sucked out of us by the long waits.Within the half hour before the parade began, we were trying to get back along the footpath to the Main Street. The path was covered in people sitting down on the ground. We had a pram with a sleeping child. There was no gaps what so ever to get along the path or even onto the road. We very politely asked for people to let us pass through. They refused. They were incredibly rude. We were stuck with the buggy surrounded by people swarming the footpath and no security to step in.Absolute abysmal experience!The fireworks at the end of the day (11pm) were well worth the wait though.",1
By far the worst themepark ever!!!Very expensive and far from cityWay too many guests and very looong lines for all attractionsEntrance demanded security checkThe line was hardly moving and took  30 minutes. Diddon't feel very safeNew line to enter was 30 min even though we had passes printet from home30 90 minutes lines for EVERY rideMany attractions closed earlyOnly possible to try FOUR rides in a whole day. Impossible to meet Mickey and his friendsReally bad and expensive food. Of course fod lines were also long and slowWe are NEVER coming back,1
"Sorry to say but our recent visit was terrible, we'd bought tickets on line costing 84    for two day tickets. When we went to pick them up we ended up being told they were not valid for July, we had to pay an additional 79    to get in. To make matters worse we could not even visit the other park that would have been an extra 40    each. I've written an email yo Disney but as expected no reply at all apart from an automated response. The 160    for one park was a joke and 5    for a medium size packet of crisps..their robbing a lot of visitors.Just go prepared..",1
"I have been going to Disneyland for almost 60 years, since I was   1. More recently I have been to Disney World in Orlando many times. This year, Disneyland is truly pathetic. Greed runs rampant. Overcrowding, treating guests like cattle, rude staff. It's the Bob Iger regime. He's made hundreds of millions of dollars squeezing the business like this. Walt would be disgusted at what his dream has become. I suppose all good (great) things must come to an end, and Disneyland is there. If you've never been, go once but be prepared as it will not live up to its heritage.If you've already been, dodon't go back, it's just sad.Just remember how cool it used to be, enjoy that memory, and save your money.",1
"We have visited DLP on a number of ocassions and previously enjoyed it for what it was   a gloriously hyped, plastic fairytale, thrill, movie experience. However, over the last decade, they have clearly cut the offering to the bone, and this time we struggled to have a good time. 2 hours waits for a 1 minute meet and greet with a princess... 2 hours, plenty of time to reflect that you are really meeting a stranger in a dress up... and I'm sorry, but as a customer, I am no longer chuffed at my six year old's reponse, (as she is mostly fed up with waiting, not wowed) and instead of pleased, I'm miffed that DLP think it's okay to keep us waiting for that blinking long.... Only one parade... people were looking for their spot 2 hours before it was due to start... it only takes ten minutes to waft by, so I wasdon't prepared to wait that long, so we were way back with a restricted view... few shows... horrendous waits for any of the good rides... the fast past system that used to work so well has broken down, as people down rush at 10 am to queue for a fast pass ticket for anything popular.... sorry   it's just not fun! Other people diddon't think so either... and were trampling the petunias to get a seat and shouting at each other as they barged around in queues. Our six year old has asked politely never to go back and I very much doubt we will. We ued to enjoy DLP so much, but with so little investment, it is falling far short of our expectations!",1
"I have spent a weekend here to support my daughters dance troupe who had the opportunity to perform there The prices are extortion    3.95 for a bottle of water and in 30    heat dancing, water is a necessity Food was a rip off Meal deal    11.99 for sandwich crisps and a drink ppI always use the 80 20 rule for customer service but I need to use it the other way 20% staff just nice 80% rude !!!!Save up and go to Florida it's a completely better experience and I'd have to be paid a lot of money to go back here Disney your staff have let you down big time in Paris I bet Walt is turning in his grave !!",1
"From the moment we got there, closed rides, expensive drinks and food it was a totally poor experience. This is France but the food especially the breakfasts on half board was rubbish. I wodon't be back. ",1
save your time and money and spend it on museums or shopping. rides kept breaking down. the park is not anywhere near as nice as the disney parks in the U.S.,1
"I've been in Parc Disneyland on June 30th, with my family and a family of a friend of mine (4 adults   3 children).We are talking about one of the most beautiful parc in Europe, in terms of organisation, attractions, etc, but I think Disney Co needs to review seriously the way of managing the queues! The Parc is a long and endless queue: as it can happen children could be tired after one hour of queue (for 5 minutes of funny at the end), I wonder why is not possible to change the experience of waiting with the introduction of some screens showing Disney films. Perhaps the same film of the attraction you are waiting for: it is difficult to do so?Again: while waiting for Peter Pan, after 45 minutes of queue, the access was stopped for a technical problem. We were informed about this issue but decided to stay in the queue: after 50 minutes more (with no further info about the expected time for the technical solution) we enjoyed the experience. The question is: it is not possible in this cases to provide people in the queue with a special ticket to skip the queue for the same or other attractions? It would be a kind of compensation for the wasted time! After Peter Pan we did the queue for Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain but the attraction was broken while we were close to jump in the train (after 40 minutes): ok, we were not lucky that day, but a compensation like a special pass for other attractions would be very appreciated.Another remark: the expected time for jumping in the Disneyland Railroad is not true. In fact the train could arrive full in every station and the people in the train could stay on. So it is true that on average the train is in each station every 30 minutes: but you could wait for the next passage (or more) to hop on it.That's it: please do something for the queues or technical failures or the experience in the Parc wodon't be different from a normal day of traffic in a big city!",1
It's a trap. The only thing you can do is waiting in a line. Not worth the money or effort. I would bot recommend going there.,1
"There's always something magically about Disney evoking memories of childhood cartoons and simple times. The park itself is nice and at times you can get lost in a fantasy, some awesome rides, sweet parades and plenty of facilities. However those rides have hideous wait times, the parade and light show need military planning in advance to actually see from a good spot and the food is crazily expensive. You come to expect these things from a theme park but the worst thing here is the staff who seem unable to answer a simple question without tutting and sarcastic replies. Just remember you might bring your kids here to see their Disney heroes, however there's a whole bunch of Disney paid villians waiting to spoil your trip. Please sort out the staff training, no excuse for bad manners.",1
"There were a lot of things I diddon't like about this park and that is why I have given it such a low score. Let me begin by saying that the rides I went on were great and the character meet and greets were great but the negatives outweighed the positives hence the low review.Cons:People smoking everywhere. This is my biggest complaint. There are designated smoking areas and this is supposed to be a  family friendly  venue but there were people openly smoking all over the park and I dodon't want to be walking around having smoke blown in my face or worse in my kids faces. Maybe its a European thing but I've never encountered it in all my visits to Walt Disney World in Florida.There are not enough of the rides and character meets that have fast passes. The queue for crush's coaster never got below 70 minutes and the queue for the princess meet and greet never got below an hour, and after queueing for an hour it would have been good to see more than 1 princess. In Epcot in Florida when you queue for an hour you get to see 4 characters. The rides are always breaking down. I think Thunder mountain must have broken down about a dozen times in the length of time that we were there.There aredon't enough big thrill rides and that is why the queues are so long at the few that they have.Pros:The Park looks wonderful and walking around soaking in the Disney atmosphere is great.The hotels are so close to the parks it is great and makes a change from a 30 40 minute bus ride from your hotel to the Parks in Florida.Hopefully now that the US Disney has taken over the Paris one they will implement some necessary changes. More thrill ridesMore fastpass attractionsNO SMOKINGAnd dare i say it Magicbands!!! Definitely needed. ",1
"Visited for 3 days with my husband and 6 year old daughter, was expecting our trip to be magical like advertised. Well it was nothing but stressful from start to finish! Of course you expect lines, but the queues here are nothing short of ridiculous, not just for the rides but for everything! You want to meet a character, then be prepared to queue for an hour (minimum!), you want to go on a mediocre ride that lasts 60 seconds? Be prepared to queue two hours! You want a burger and drink? Be prepared to queue for over 30 minutes! You want to see the parade and the light show? Find a spot an hour in advance and again... wait....In 35 degree heat with very little shade! Some of the staff are very rude! Everything is ridiculously priced. The crowds again bordering on crazy! I honestly cannot for the life of me see what the hype is?!?! I love theme parks and I love Disney, but I can honestly say I have never been more disappointed in my life! ",1
"As with the more popular park in Orlando, this park is a horrible place to go. The long wait for rides of very short duration are a real problem for the children. This is made worse with absence of any real fast pass service. We found that the information posted on the estimated wait times was highly inaccurate. While most of the posted times were actually shorter, we waited much longer than expected for two of the rides (in case the wait was 1 1 2 hours when the posted time was 40 minutes). The monitors do not measure the children waiting in line for a ride until the end of the line meaning they can wait for 2 hours to go on a ride and then be told they cadon't ride it. Food is another huge problem. As with all the Disney parks, it is awful and extraordinarily expensive. However, the lines in the cafeterias are poorly managed. The offerings are very limited and only one type of food can be found at any single location. This means that one child cadon't have a hot dog and another a pizza at the same time (try finding two kids to agree on what to eat). The restaurants are reservation only and fully booked in advance. On the other hand, and unlike the US parks, you can bring in food from the outside. Many people did. If we had known we could, the trip would have been more enjoyable.The one area Disneyland Paris truly was better than the US parks is in the merchandise offered. The clothing was well maid with embroidered details rather than the decals on the US offerings. There was a wider variety of toys and novelties.",1
"Will never go again, waste of time, waiting for hours and hours for nothing, too much expensive, does not worth it, dont spend your time and your money for waiting on the lines for days. No benefit on going disneyland.",1
"They diddon't handle things professionally, it was overall a terrible experience to begin with. the lines took an hour and a half or more, keep in mind it wasdon't even a busy day it was a Tuesday. People were very rude, they just diddon't deserve the money they got from us and I will never be going back.",1
"I looked by the magic was gone. Everyone was running from one attraction to the other, without any consideration for other people. We had some HalfBoard Plus vouchers and it was, indeed, quite a burden to find a place that accepted them   either extremely busy or a reservation was needed with days in advance. Everything was very dark and old.",1
"Been to Disney Orlando Florida multiple times, was well aware that Disney Paris would be smaller and that they only have the two parks so I thought I was going open minded, but Disney Paris needs to lock their doors close up shop. It is small with unhappy , unfriendly staff, we had five broken down rides and no one could tell us when they would be working. The park has large Disney posters everywhere but that attraction or restaurant is not there. This is not one of the happiest places in the world like Disney says. A parade that is maybe 8 minutes long Main Street is pathetic, save your time money.",1
"We were very disappointed. The website offers discounted tickets available only for the day afer the tickets are purchased. We were in Paris for a short stay and when we saw that tickets could be bought for 57    for the two parks instead of 89   , we thought it was worth it. Turned out it was impossible to make the booking. We spent 2hours trying but an error message that diddon't explain the failure kept appearing. We tried with various of our credit cards with no better success. When we tried to call Disneyland they were closed and when they reopened the next day they refused to offer us the discounted price. We left Paris the day after without having had the chance to visit the park. ",1
We got a deal on tickets so not too bothered about the high prices some pay. We paid about    50 each (plus train fare form Paris).What everyone says about queues into the park (twice) and rides is spot on. It's rubbish and hot and uncomfortable with little shade for the longest part of queues. I got a bit of a tan but ruined a tshirt with sweatiness!!!! Had to buy a new one after we left.Started ok with some bubbly Disney sounds and buildings then the crowds and shoddy management took over. We manager three rides all day! ,1
"Arrived here before 10am, had to pay 20 euros parking on top of the   110 for 2 tickets. Took over 90 mins to get in to the place even with tickets booked in advance to find that most rides already had waiting times of 50   100 mins!! Even to see a disney character! Most queues were not shaded which on a hot sunny day (34 degrees C) is very difficult! So we decided to get fast pass tickets. Yay! Not.. We got our first fast pass and had to wait 5 hours to use it and then found we coulddon't get a second fast pass for 2 hours.. To get a fast pass on one of the rides would have left us waiting until 10pm... Then there's the food. Good luck finding somewhere to sit once you've got your tray of food that's just cost you a fortune and you waited an hour for.. We sat on the floor..After walking around endlessly we left at 3pm without getting on a single ride.. So as you can tell, we had a great time!",1
"What do you say when you your Disney loving wife doesdon't last an hour in the park?We caught the train from Paris to the park and got there when it opened at 10am. Got in very quickly for Disney standards, probably due to an overcast and slightly rainy morning. But that's where the thumbs up for Disneyland Paris ended. Most of the rides were open but nothing else, nothing! No stalls, no caravans, no restaurants, nothing! It seems you have to wait an hour before the staff arrive and very slowly decide to open up. It was ridiculous! After an hour of wandering aimlessly around this very small Disneyland where every road seemed to lead to a dead end we decided that was enough. My guess is the same for all the other tourists we saw doing the exact same thing. Where was the magic that Disney creates in it's other parks. We've done California, Florida and Hong Kong Disney's and this should not even be able to bear the same name. I cadon't believe that the Disney corporation who apparently own 84% of it let this happen.",1
Dodon't waste your time and money here. Your kids get 3 4 rides a day as each ride has 1.5 hour long wait times. Too many people allowed in each day for such a small facility.,1
"bought 2 Disneyland tickets for me and my daughter who is terminally ill as this was one of her dying wishes , however within a month of buying the tickets her condition significantly worsened and she is unable to travel to France , I emailed them twice explaining the situation and asked if I could get a refund so myself and my daughter could do something together in the uk to get no response , spoke to them on the phone yesterday but they blank point refused to let me have a refund . Gave me an email address of another department , so I explained the situation and this is the response I received,  We thank you for your e mail and your interest in Disneyland   Paris.We are sorry to hear about your daughter.We regret that the conditions of  Print at Home  tickets are very strict and therefore your tickets are non refundable, non exchangeable and non transferable, therefore we are very sorry we cannot provide you with a refund.Absolutely disgusting , what's   130 to Disney , never giving them a penny again ",1
"Visited both Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios with the Mrs on the 29th and 30th of April. This is what we think:Pros:1. Good production value in terms of sets, sounds, character costumes etc.2. Fantastic fireworks show at the end (22:00)Cons:1. Not many rides for teens adults: There are around 6 rides in Disneyland (and around 5 in Walt Disney Studios) that can be enjoyed by those who are over 16. This means you're spending over   110 per person (for a 2 day 2 park ticket) for a maximum of 11 rides. And it's highly unlikely that you'll get a chance to go on all 11 rides in the days that you're visiting as at least 2   3 of them will be  Under maintenance  and the remaining will have ridiculous wait times!2. Terribly overcrowded: Average wait times of over 90 minutes for the best rides and that's just what's communicated up front via the app or the signboards at the entrance to the ride. We joined a queue when the wait time was supposed to be 40 minutes and waited for over an hour before we got on the ride. Fastpass tickets regularly sell out and some of the key attractions in Walt Disney Studio dodon't have fastpass facility.3. Food Drink is 4 to 5 times more expensive: Water is    3.29! You'll have to queue for an average of 40 minutes to pay an extortionate amount for downright terrible food. On day 2, we learnt our lesson and brought food from outside.In summary, you're going to end up paying a lot of money for accommodation, food and tickets to come to a theme park where you'll get a chance to ride on less than 3 decent rides a day! My recommendation is, if you're from the UK, you save yourself the pain and visit Thorpe Park or Alton Towers instead.*** I've visited several theme parks in the U.K., Dubai and India and Disneyland Paris is by far the worst in my experience.",1
"Long queue with minimum of 60min waiting, just unacceptable and unbearable for 1 min ride with young kids.Starting by the entrance to the park, long queues absolutely disorganized and messy. No staff available to guide you or wish you welcome after validating your ticket. We spent the whole day at Disney from 11am to 10pm and we havedon't seen none of the characters except during the parade. Forget to have a picture of your little one with Mickey or his friends, there were not at Disneyland Paris!Streets was quite dirty and toilets absolutely disgusting. No separate toilet for changing babies in the park. Poor signage. In the whole day we could enjoy 2 rides. It's a small word was one of the best ride with kids. Space mountain was closed. Over 60min of queue to get some hotdogs at night at the Casey. The fireworks and light and sound show at night was amazing. Most probably most of the few things you'll enjoy.We paid 79    per adult, 71    for our kid of 3 years old. At this price we expect at least to see Minnie or Mickey walking around the streets throughout the day.Extremely disappointed first experience at Disneyland Paris. Never again! We expected long queues and crowd but not this poor organization and service.",1
"I bought pre paid tickets from Sydney and we still had to line up where people purchase tickets (1.20hr wait in queue). Not many rides. Some rides were closed and there are over an hr or two wait for each ride   a ride that lasts only a few minutes! My 8 yr old was totally disappointed. There are better theme parks in Gold Coast, Australia   go there People! Food was ridiculously over priced as they 'package' their offer. Take your own food if you can (if allowed not sure).",1
Was looking forward to the 4 days at the park but after the first day we really diddon't want to go back as they pack as many people into the park as humanly possible. With small children it's hard to explain that we would have to wait 2 hours for a 30 second ride that really doesdon't do much is a tricky thing. You know it's bad when you have to wait 20 minutes to get what is the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted and put in the bin after a few sips For the money we paid we could of stay at splash landings in Alton towers for a whole week and had a much better time. ,1
"This was our first visit to Disney Paris having previously been to both Disney's in America (California & Florida), we had lowered our expectations as the Americans just know how to put on a show. However, we never lowered them enough, overall the staff (crew) were grumpy at best and certainly not in the Disney spirit, the early access was pointless as only a couple of the big rides and only one of the parks was open before ten and 2 of the main rides were closed permanently or kept on breaking down, It was also hard to find somewhere open to get a drink food before ten. The photo pass is not worth the cost as the only photographers we saw were by the characters which always had massive queue's, in America there are photographers dotted all around the parks which results in a great Disney photo album at the end. I also coulddon't understand the lack of English in rides and shows which I thought would back up the French, surely being the only Disney in Europe you would want to include the rest of Europe by having anything French followed by the English translation? In short, If you have the resources please fly across the pond to experience a proper magical experience which you and your children will cherish forever. I just wish to forget Disney Paris as quickly as I can.",1
"All day for two rides not really vaule for money, Que are two hours long.trying to keep the kids in the que for that long. Even they gave up in the end. Walk and see the rides and the parade at the end.should be a limit on people allowed in the park. We wodon't be returning there. Paris is better vaule for money and less stress.",1
"Booked a 3 day trip to Disneyland Paris for three people, cost   2000, they then charged an extra   122 to amend my daughters surname that had been input to system incorrectly. Definitely about the Disney money not the Disney magic.",1
"We visited Disneyland Park as a group of adults and teenagers and were very disappointed by the whole experience. It is very overpriced and over rated for what it turns out to be.There were far too many visitors in the Park which made it difficult to view the parades and as a consequence we had to queue for everything rides, toilets and 40 minutes for a cup of tea which is completely unacceptable. The Thunder Mountain Ride broke down whilst we were waiting and when it was back up and running we queued an hour and a half for a 5 min ride ridiculous! after that we gave up. There were no Disney characters walking around the Park but I understand that there are designated meeting points around the Park where you could meet them but with the crowds this would have proved an impossibility .We left feeling that we had well and truely fleeced.... Disney Magic....more like Disney nightmare...save yourselves the time money and effort and spend a day and evening in beautiful Paris instead .",1
"If you add up the time you spend waiting in a line compared with the hours actually on a ride, the ratio is really poor. Even food and drink took over an hour to get   disgraceful. Sadly my 6 year old still loved it.",1
Dodon't do it if you are from North America. There is very little to see and do. The lines are insane   hour long plus for things you would do at a Fall Fair in the smallest of Canadian communities. Europe is wonderful for many things but theme parks is evidently not one of them. ,1
"My Disney Park experienceUnclear about how to order tickets online   doesdon't explicitly tell you limited days until after purchase. I purchased a weekday ticket but it was not valid for that day a Monday, still not sure why? Entrance wait for security   10   20 minTold not able to scan pass on phone   need to print tickets   30min to find a place. If travelling   it is difficult to access a printer. A lot of people were having this problem! Time to upgrade tickets 1.5 hours   cost me for upgrade of    133 on top of    88 paid initially for 1 adult   2 kids. Finally get in after over 2 1 4 hours. Kids hungry   walk around for an hour to find place as everything is full with huge queuesWait in line to order food 45 min. Food is very expensive and average.    15 for a burger deal! No free wifi in the place. This would be helpful for parents who will spend 90% of their day standing in queues.3 main rides closed which forces more people onto the other rides(Pirate of Caribbean, Phantom manor,Star Wars hyperspace)Wait time for most rides over an hourBad coffee diddon't help the pain   this is France ! Often see spaces that could be filled up on rides   even when people are waiting over an hour per ride. Other disneylands use a singles queue to fill capacity, and we are happy to spilt to reduce waiting times. Nothing fast about fast pass   often queues were as long as regularStaff nowhere near as friendly or helpful as the Anaheim park. Whilst kids were happy   think parents could do a lot better with their time and money than going to Euro Disney in France. ",1
Not a slick operation   expected better after visiting in 2003 and 2010 but alas poor service and staff diddon't seem to care. No apologies for delays.,1
"We visited a few years ago and had fond memories. Yesterday was just lines.Has Disney run out money that they need the full the place with people so there are endless lines.Place opens to the public at 10:00. We were there just before with pre bought tickets.First attraction we lined up at 10:10 and it was an 80 minutes wait.Would not recommend to anyone till Disney sort themselves out.Dodon't waste your time. There are much better places to go, spend time and money (very expensive for what you get in return, lines...)",1
"Despite advertisement smokers are freely smoking without being challenged. Once I saw a fire Marshall come out next to buzz ride and walk through a cloud of smoke, they did not challenge the smoker. There was even smokers next to the slinky ride in the Studios again unchallenged. I did complain to guest services in city hall but was met by a shrug and  what can we do?  Either there needs to be more designated areas provided or there will need to be designated staff to patrol areas for this. ",1
"Our bag was stolen at the Disney security centres. It was my goddaughters birthday gift and we lost passports, money, keys, everything. We received no help from security, suddenly they diddon't speak English, the hotel refused to accept a transfer of money so that we could eat and drink and my goddaughter got to wait for 10 hours outside the park while we were interviewed by the police and with the embassy to get us home. It's cost us over   1000 to get home not including the wasted money on the trip.Two weeks later we have had nothing, not even an explanation from Disney, a large company thinking they can just ignore customers, but happy to take our money. This is a place for kids and adults? They cant even make us safe and secure at their own security centres. How many other people have been through this? Disgusting behaviour, Disney should be ashamed, the 25th anniversary of poor.",1
"The parks are too overcrowded which unfortunately means you spend the majority of the day in queues. You can only fit in a small number of rides a day due to the waiting time. Fast passes are not always available and even if you manage to get one there is no guarantee that it will be accepted. We tried for 2 days to get on to the ratatouille attraction without success despite having a fast pass on the day of my son's birthday and travelling back to the park at the allocated time, very disappointing. The early admission for Disney Hotel residents is a bit of a farce as the attractions are not open and queues form at the different lands. DO NOT QUEUE FOR THE OPENING OF FRONTIERLAND as it is in my opinion unsafe for children due to adults running and pushing to get ahead. The shuttle buses are also unsafe for children at busy times for the same reason. I visited here 11 years ago and in my opinion it has lost the Disney magic. The attractions would be a lot more enjoyable if we didnt have to queue for 60 minutes to enjoy them and if crowds were managed better. I'm afraid the memories I take from this visit are queuing, being pushed and squashed in crowds and being disappointed which is a shame as there is so much potential.",1
"Worst amusement park ever. For the whole day we could only get into 5 attractions because the only thing you do here is waiting in the queues! It's common to wait 90 minutes for a 30 second ride. Sick. Definitely not worth visiting, unlike any other attraction in Paris.",1
"We made a mid March spring break trip to both parks Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios. It looked so promising and I was undeterred with a notice that some rides may be closed. The weather in March is perfect. A light jacket and you are all set. The park wasdon't particularly crowded making it easy to get onto Indiana Jones and Temple of Peril, then the Big Thunder Mountain. The lines were less than 30 minutes, no fastpass necessary. Unfortunately that was the day, you see ALL the major rides were closed. It wasdon't 1 or 2 in one of the parks, the whole damn core of the park was closed. We diddon't ride one single ride in Walt Disney Studios, there was nothing to ride except the infant rides. It is complete robbery.Here is a run down.Space Mountain 2   closed people working on itPirates of the Carribean   closed no one working on itAerosmith Rockin Roller Coaster   closed, ride shut down broken while standing in line.Armageddon Special Effects   closed no one working on it.We stood in line for the one other thrill ride open, the Tower of Terror and the 45 minute wait was changed to at least 1.5 hours as they were struggling to get throughput through the ride. The exit at the giftshop had a trickle of people once in a while that came out. The sudden jump in wait time wasnt from a flood of fastpass holders but from a ride that wasdon't functioning again.This park has so much potential, the rides are there, same layout, its newer and clean, the old tired rides like its a small world are not consuming space. Its actually a little cheaper with the strength of the dollar, but the park is not functioning. Man I would love for this to be viable. The weather was fantastic, but as it is it is a complete waste of money unless you have infants  toddlers that are just going to see the Disney characters. Wow, what a disappointment. I wish it was operating properly, so much potential.Between the 2 parks we spent 1 2 a day, took a train back to Paris and spent the afternoon in the Louvre...",1
So after saving an absolute fortune to take my family of 5 for a special break to Euro Disney we wish we'd saved more to go to florida!The park was rediculous. Two of my children got on 2 rides a day!! No queue was less than an hour and on average most were over 1.5 hours! The fast passed sold out by 11.30am and even entering the park early at 9.30 they still waited over an hour to get on one ride! So over priced. Woulddon't ever recommend anyone to go,1
"Stayed here in March 2017. It was our 8th, and last time. Yet again, a handful of the better rides were closed. The one that were open kept breaking down( Big thunder mountain was closed more than it was open). No apologies from these people. Even the fast pass ticket machines were occasionally closed. The fast food restaraunts have become really expensive. 14.99 Euros for a burger and chips! It's not the place it was ten years ago. If the entire park isdon't open they shopud reflect this in their prices.",1
"Dirty, Smelly, rude staff, lots of rides closed, lots of shows not on, and no it's not because I've been to Disney in America. It was a waste of money and I'd never advise anyone to visit.",1
"I cannot believe anyone would give this park a good review. When we lived in the states we would go to Disney in Florida all the time.....I was actually a Disney authorized travel agent for a while which I loved. We are, for lack of a better word....Disney experts. Here's what I can tell you about Disney Paris.....it is a travesty and an embarrassment to the Disney Brand. If I were an executive at Disney I would personally be horrified by the Paris parks. I cannot believe the lack of rides, outdated and irrelevant rides like Armageddon, the lack of entertainment including shows, parades and so on... constantly broken down rides (I've never seen such inconsistent rides)....not to mention the horrible awful customer service. We have lived in Paris for five years and have had season passes three of those. We have actually stayed at Disney Paris at two different hotels and had equally bad experiences. Sequoia lodge was so dirty and run down and NOT cheap!! My opinion really think before coming out here. I personally think they should shut the entire place down for two to three years and reboot.......it's THAT bad. The real sin of it all is the awful...terrible experience it gives Europeans. I promise you Disney in Florida is much much much better!! Terrible!!!! Shame on you Disney!!!!",1
"Attached is a letter that I wrote to Disneyland Paris summarizing my experiences there. I hope it is helpful to other prospective visitors. Dear Disneyland Paris, I am writing to you to inform you of the discriminatory and unacceptable actions of your employees against guests with disabilities. I am an adult (age 23) wheelchair user who visited your park on Saturday, 4 March, 2017 with my aide. The first disaster occurred upon attempting to enter the Disneyland hotel. Our hotel in Paris (the Shangri la) had arranged with our driver and with the Disneyland hotel for us to enter the park through the Disneyland hotel for wheelchair accessibility reasons. Shangri la gave Disneyland our names and information. We were stopped by security, and even after presenting our passports and my wheelchair, we were denied access into the hotel area and forced to enter the park through less accessible entrance. The second problem occurred with security and bag check. There was no clear line for wheelchair users and the employees ushering us in were uninformed. Because I was carrying a bag, I was asked after a long wait to join the wheelchair inaccessible line in the pouring rain, which caused further delays. Nearly half an hour later, we were finally able to attend the park. The third problem was inside the park at the information desk, where I experienced great difficulty obtaining a priority pass, despite having arrived prepared with ample documentation. Although I am above average height (165cm), the desk was so high that I could barely make eye contact with the employee attending to us, who was extremely rude and refused to speak with or look at me, only addressing my aide and asking her to sign everything. I am a university educated adult (who will soon earn a master   s degree) with a physical disability, but I was treated as though I were a child or had an intellectual disability. I was also informed on your website that my aide could enter the park free, but was told that this was not possible once I tried to enter the park and could not receive a refund.The fourth problem was the lack of accessible ramps and misinformation given by employees. There were few signs directing us to accessible entrances, and employees were unhelpful in guiding us to wheelchair ramps, either shrugging or blatantly giving misinformation when they did not know the answer. Many of the few ramps that were available were steeper than legal regulations mandate and were difficult to navigate.The fifth and most discriminatory problem was the treatment I received by employees who were managing the rides. This happened at multiple attractions.After entering Peter Pan   s wheelchair accessible entrance, I was asked by an attendant to wait for several minutes. When he finally returned, I handed my priority pass to him, expecting to board the ride. He shook his head and said,    People like you aren   t allowed on this ride.    I explained that I could transfer myself from the wheelchair to the ride, but he responded that his    boss    told him not to let wheelchair users enter. He said if I wished to enter the ride, I could wait in the standard queue. I explained to him that my wheelchair would not fit in the standard queue. He shrugged, said,    That   s the way it is,    and walked away.At It   s a Small World, I entered the accessible entrance and patiently waited to board the boat. I was asked by two different employees who were not in contact with each other if I needed a    special    boat or if I could board a    normal    one. I told them that I was capable of entering the normal boat. They told me my wait time was two minutes, but proceeded to keep me waiting for fifteen minutes before they got me a    special    boat, which I did not need.At Autopia, there was a trash bin placed on the wheelchair ramp that blocked my entrance to the attraction. I attempted to get the attention of the employees, who looked at me but did not move the bin. Once I entered the Autopia car, a female attendant moved my wheelchair directly into the rain. When my aide complained afterward, the attendant rudely said,    This is not my problem.    My wheelchair was soaked, despite the fact that ample sheltered space was available to park the chair.The worst experience I had (and the reason we promptly exited the park afterward) was at the Indiana Jones roller coaster ride at 3:00 3:40pm. I entered the wheelchair accessible entrance and waited behind about five other guests. The attendant asked for my name and priority pass, which I provided. After the guests before me boarded the ride, she told me that my aide and I would be next. Afterward, she said I needed to wait longer, and switched twice with two other attendants, who told me the same thing. I proceeded to wait for approximately 40 minutes, even though I was next in line while FORTY OTHER GUESTS WHO HAD ARRIVED AFTER US were allowed to board. The park was not very busy, so if the normal line had been accessible, the wait would have been shorter. I asked several times why I could not board, and the employees said,    There are many people here,    refusing to give me an answer. I patiently explained that there were only two of us and that I could easily transfer onto the ride, but they said that my wheelchair was a problem. When I was eventually granted access, there was no one behind us in line. Literally every single person who had arrived after us had already gone on the ride. When I told the employees that what they had done was irresponsible, they verbally mocked me.The constant discrimination I faced in your park is ableist, illegal, and embarrassingly outdated. Your disorganized Paris employees made it clear that I was not a welcomed guest and treated me with disdain and disgust, as though my disability was a burden with which they were forced to deal, rather granting me the equal respect that I am entitled to as a human being. As someone who has previously enjoyed countless positive experiences at Disneyland Anaheim, I was outraged by the way I was treated in your Paris park. I demand an answer and for your park to be held accountable. I can be contacted at the following addresses and expect your explanation and resolution immediately. ",1
"We went for three days with a toddler who, luckily, is young enough to be distracted from the disappointment.  On arrival we were given our meal vouchers (full board so two meals a day plus the 'free' breakfast) and told to make reservations at the concierge. The only slot they had available was one the following night despite our hotel having two restaurants, the second of which was always empty. Shame they diddon't use it for over spill and double the capacity for the buffet. No others slots at any restaurant for the whole trip which meant our meal plan was useless, our food bill was doubled after we had to buy separately at non meal plan restaurants.  45% of the attractions where closed for refurbishment or broken which left very little to do and very long queues if you wanted to do it. Rides were incredibly short in duration if you did go on one. The parks look very run down and tired with the castle's moat empty of water, very little Disney atmosphere around.  The weekend boasted a St.David's day theme however all we saw were five huts selling welsh tea and love spoons that were closed until the evening (unless you count the weather which was definitely Welsh themed!) In the evening we planned to watch the light show on the castle. It was hard to find out a time as all information only gave 'end of the day'. No mention if that's end of visitor hours or magic hours (It turns out it 9:30ish) but left after getting repeatedly stood on and people climbing over the pushchair and hitting my toddler in order to get a better smoking spot in the crowd.Smoking restrictions are not followed anywhere in the park which is horrible when you're trying to eat or queue. Security is poor going into the parks which makes you wonder why they bother as most people are waved through unchecked even after the machine flagging you up. One guard said he needed to check me then said he coulddon't be bothered after all. Extortionate prices in the hotel shops...5 Euro for bag of Doritos! They make the most out of their hostages. The train station is a short walk and has a newsagents with a better and cheaper selection as well as a sandwich place with some very tasty baguettes. Even the vending machines are better value.On the day of checkout I asked if it was possible to have a late checkout and was told they were too busy to deal with doing it. The people in the queue next to me were asking if they could leave their luggage after checkout while they went into the park for the rest of their day and were also told by staff that they were too busy to deal with the request despite it being given as a perk of staying at a park hotel.The room was a decent size however the beds were small and the windows in our room diddon't close properly. We kept the heating on to compensate but the squeaking from the system was too much to bear. The bird song that is played through the speakers all night kept waking me up due to the open window and the carpet looked like it haddon't been hoovered in a month as there were desiccated pieces of food under the table and by the sides of the bed.Disneyland Paris is really letting the brand down as far as the parks go, it's worlds away from Orlando.",1
"We visited this park in March, assuming this would not be a full crowded season, but it turned out to be very disappointing. We stood in line the whole day (even while using fastpass lanes). Many rides were closed for remodeling (Space Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean   which in themselves are the whole point of going to Disneyland). Paying full fares to stand around in never ending lines in the cold was hard on the children. Disneyworld Florida is crowded as well but offers many more ride options. If you do decide to go to Disneyland Paris, make sure you pay the extra 15 Euros to get the flexible pass that allows entry to Disney Studios and get more for your money    but I sincerely doubt it. We just felt completely ripped off.",1
"Took our 4 year old granddaughter for a birthday treat. Stayed at Santa Fe, average at the best. As many people have said huge queue's for absolutely everything,whether this was down to half term or lots been refurbished who knows....also very expensive,which we expected,though how they can charge so much is beyond me,   5 average for a drink. We paid for full board premium meal plans, almost   600 for lunch and dinner for 3 on 3 days, everyone had free breakfast. Waste of money...coulddon't get in to restaurants at all without bookings....1st time visitors! I rang to book various things 6 weeks before we went, lunch with princesses' fully booked, although still available on Disney website, same with breakfast with Mickey, and the wild west show, so assume bookings need to be made well in advance! Where we did eventually eat, places very expensive and menus limited, it much choice for vegis. The only saving grace was that my granddaughter loved it, even the waiting hours for everything, meet and greet been the worse! Complained whilst there and followed with emails on return home, no replies tho, presume now they've had our money they dodon't care. Not what I was expecting, very disappointed. As supposed to be a 3 star review, woulddon't alter for some reason ",1
"Am here with friends. No less than THREE times did we queue for an hour, reaching the front of the queue, only for the ride to break down entirely and the staff to send everyone away without any explanation or compensation. The park seems woefully ill equipped to deal with wet weather (have they not realized that some rides are outdoors?) and is in no way close to being able to deal with large numbers of visitors. We are here in winter, I assume that coming here during peak period is like holidaying in Gomorrah as God burns it down. At the RC Racer, passengers were literally TRAPPED in the vehicle for ten minutes with no staff attempting to explain (see attached picture). Currently in the restaurant having waited twenty minutes in the queue to join the queue. For the extortionate amount we paid, standing in queues (which is fine) WITHOUT getting on the ride is unforgivable and not worth the money. ",1
"This whole place feels like an homage to the 1990's. The parade was basic; the rides broke frequently or were already shut for refurbs. We waited 35 minutes in an allegedly fastpass queue because they were allowing people regardless of timing to join (big thunder mountain, the only  big  ride of the day that was open). Disney studios was better but is tiny. Most rides dodon't have fast passes, so we waited for 2 hours to watch the ride break in front of us! Restaurants were either shut or full or fried food. Mickeys cafe was basic food but again, we had a booking and queued for 30 minutes. Valentine, our  waitress  was rude, forgot things and mixed up the order completely. Hotel (Santa fe) was basic. Again queue for breakfast, no one pays attention to the time slots. Best thing here was planet Hollywood. And that's saying something. Whole place needs some investment and magic putting back in.",1
"I went with my son in February hoping it would be quieter due to his ADHD. I got fast tracked disability tickets but it seems an awful lot of French also have these tickets, never seen this at a park in the UK and 95% of the disability queue is French (and it's a really big queue). So we had to wait in queues of one hour when frequently the normal queue was faster due to priority given to different disabilities. I dodon't mind queuing but my son simply cadon't, so therefore it was extremely stressful. I wish I had just gone to Blackpool or Alton Towers, it's much more organised and enjoyable. We fell out most of the day, children dodon't enjoy queuing most especially when the have disabilities, spoils it! Clearly this park is too busy and huge amount of large rides are closed. I woulddon't come back, I want family fun not trauma and stress!",1
"Honestly, I know this will have little impact   and it may break your kids hearts  but it will save you a fortune.This place is dated and tired   I was here years ago and nothing's really changed. Technology has moved on and Disneyland Paris's rides are still in the late 80s early 90s!Today 3 main attractions were being refurbished or out of order  thunder mountain, pirates and that old Star Wars thing  yet do you think that they reduced any prices? For us   family of 3   to get the train from Paris, buy tickets and food   around   200. We managed 3 attractions on that day the haunted house (12mins) Pinocchio (2mins) Snow White (2mins)  so under 20 minutes of third rate 'entertainment' in 5 6 hours. Queuing was horrible too. If Disney spent more time in actually trying to build attractions to enhance the experience and reduce queues, instead of restaurants and shops in this complex it may be different  but no, the only thing they want is for you to spend your hard earned cash on their overpriced garbage.This was the worst value for money experience I've encountered and will never knowingly give a penny to Disney   even if they completely flatten and rebuild it.",1
Our first family problem with Disney was booking we made a error with our booking and where happy to pay more money to change and add a day it was genuin mistake which now means our autistic son his twin sister and myself a organ transplant patient will not be able to go and stuck with a large bill for nothing.fly be where happy to change and everyone was happy to do so accept Disney there opinion is contract is a contract and your sons and your health does not matter and compassion is not in our ethos as a company. my son loves Disney it's how we communicate with him and he loves the Disney castle this is such a shame and I am upset for him and disappointed with Disneys booking department which is supposed to be family and special needs oriented. I am sure once in the park he would of been treated brilliantly if we could of made it he would of been so happy and it would of helped him so much and that would of made us All happy very sad day for my kids and Disney,1
Paid in the region of 2000 pound for four day trip to Disney land for my daughters birthday Must say after being here two times before this will be my last Only half the rides on in main park and others closed because of technical issues ( think that's the official statement for lack of staff ) Although we still managed to get through the day and having to cue for everything due to the park only being part open have to say I dodon't think I'll be back to Paris Disney Expensive and badly managed and organised Four days in Paris for the same price as two weeks in Orlando You would think they would make an effort,1
"Before I start and in case anyone thinks I'm anti Disney that is not the case. I've visited Disneyland in L.A. and visited Walt Disney World on 5 occasions staying on site on three occasions. I love Disney but Disneyland Paris was a total shambles.It looked great with the decorations and festive atmosphere etc. but it was horrendously busy. We got in at 0910 with the park opening 10 minutes earlier and queues had already built up. We went to the Studios first and the RocknRoller Coaster was a 45 mins. by that time. By later in the day the queues were simply unacceptable. I'm used to Disney queues around the world but 180 min queue for a five minute ride is simply idiotic. Yes, we went during the French Christmas holiday period but there were far too many people in that park. I dread to think what would have happened if they'd had to evacuate quickly.We went over to the main Park at lunchtime to let our 9 year old ride the thrill rides   that was a joke. He's 142 cm's as I measured him to be sure. He was refused access on Indiana Jones with a minimum limit of 140 by a totally disinterested staff member who actually hit his head with the measuring stick on the way past. This was queue management and nothing else. Star Tours was closed for refurbishment so that was out. Big Thunder Mountain was shut due to a fault so we went to Space Mountain   also shut due to a fault. So we had a park stuffed to bursting point and the four biggest rides all out of limits.Decided to have some lunch and see if the rides would restart. That was a joke. Every place was bursting at the seams with folks sitting eating on the floors or outside in sub zero temperatures as there were no seats. Ended up with burger and chips outside in the cold. No patio heaters or shelter. Just left to get on with it by staff who coulddon't care less and were totally run off their feet.Big Thunder Mountain did re open but immediately shot up to 2 hours wait so we gave it a miss.In short this was the biggest waste of nearly   200 I've ever spent. I WILL be back to WDW but I'll give the money grabbing shambles which is Disneyland Paris a miss in future. I'll never complain about queueing in the heat of Florida again.Sorry Disney you seriously angered me and let down you're company name in a way I woulddon't have imagined. 0 10 from us and sort out your numbers before somebody gets seriously injured.",1
"Really not impressed  stayed at one of the Disney hotels   on the whole we found the staff unfriendly, there was no Disney atmosphere in the hotels and the parks, the lines were on average over an hour long no matter the time of day. You do not see a Disney character unless it's a paid for meet and greet. The park is very poorly signed and the staff are not overly eager to communicate in any language other than French. As my husband summed it up, 'there's no Disney love at this place'. I would not recommend it to anyone.",1
After being around 10 times in the past I will definitely not be going back. We where unable to go on or see various shows  rides as too many people .. try queuing with 2 children under 5 . They have skimp on fireworks with a light show so unless you get your space an hour before you cannot see the display very well . Staff look miserable and do not greet you . Lack of Disney characters walking around like there used to be . A truly stressful holiday . I will not be going again . Poor attitude. Too busy. Zero customer service.,1
"Frankly, I'm surprised the Disney Corporation is happy to have its brand associated with something as badly run as this. They summarily decide to finish fast passes (for no apparent reason), the rides break down intermittently, the food is dreadful and vastly overpriced and queue jumping appears to be a common pastime here. The place looks and sounds magical, as you'd expect, but the heart is simply not here. Such a shame.",1
"I have just returned from Disneyland and the park itself is faultless. Great rides and a great setting. Unfortunately all this is ruined by the hordes and hordes of children. (It was like the walking dead on smarties) my enjoyment was ruined by he clear lack of discipline in 99% of visiting children who basically had a free for all with no intervention from their parents! From the constant screaming, to having endless prams bashed into my feet! To the running and screaming around the restaurants banging tables with their parents simply having the attitude of  it's Disneyland go nuts  I must also mention that I visited at a time when schools were not in half terms and I can only say no wonder the economy is in dire trouble with thousands of children missing out on valuable education! (120 minute wait for ratatouille in term time!)If your a parent reading this then know that my day will come and I will have a child of my own. And I will simply visit Disneyland give them a box of smarties and watch them go nuts!In short Disneyland is a great place to visit (if not expensive) just would be better without the children! :p",1
"I cadon't understand how anyone can give this place a good review. It is so overcrowded with lots of rides out of action. There is no atmosphere, no Disney magic, no characters walking around. It was such a disappointment. The French also seem to lack awareness of personal space and are constantly banging into your back as you queue, even when the queue isdon't moving. Queue jumping and letting their kids run riot also seems to be perfectly acceptable. As is mowing you down with their buggies and barging you out the way   whether you are an adult or a child. As others have mentioned, smoking is rife all over the park. The security guards with dogs also let their dogs crap on the pavement and dodon't bother to clear it up. You will spend your whole time queueing Queuing for underwhelming 30 second ridesQueueing for a vile coffee or disgusting junk foodQueueing for the unsanitary toilets You get my point. Dodon't buy into the hype. Spend your money on something else worthwhile.",1
"Disney have got this so wrong and you come away never wanting to buy anything Disney again! The majority of the park under renovation with unimaginative boarding and temporary signage. I would expect more from Disney as it could have been themed and made as an experience but no its just painted grey and boarded up. Some areas are almost completly closed and you do feel ripped off for a once in a lifetime trip! I accept that things need updating but dodon't update multiple rides throughout the park at the same time! We counted over 10 rides closed for renovation and then on 4 other occasions rides were temporary shut due to technical faults. These did reopen but then caused long queues at other rides due to these faults. Whilst you can almost accept renovation however unimaginative it is done the price of food is something that is unforgivable! You are quite simply robbed if you expect to eat! When you do remorgage your house and decide to buy a meal the quality is shocking and something you would get at a late night food joint! Simply do not eat here it is not worth it! There is also a severe lack of seating within the park and if you go out of season there is not much cover anywhere and no where to sit where it's warm with kids. The kids did get very cold at parts and as we coulddon't afford the restaurants you are left with little choice but to leave the park and go to the hotel. Overall you feel very much like you are being fleeced of money and whilst some things seem reasonable in price like the photopass between the renovations and the cost of food it's simply not worth going! There are better theme parks I'm the country that I live in that I can go in a day and it costs nothing near going to Disney. The characters are good and they do spend time with the children but there is no hospitality and the park has no atmosphere, severely lacking the Disney magic that they promise. ",1
"Just come back from a 3 day visit to Disney Paris. We have been many times before but it seems they have  lost the plot .We travelled with daughter and 5 grand children looking forward to giving them a similar experience to what we had previously experienced, only to find that not one ride had less than 60 min waiting time including children's rides, the main adult rides were 90 mins plus and fast pass availability 4 to 5 hours in advance! We only achieved 6 rides over 3 days! Costing over   1000 for the tickets is daylight robbery.Both parks were the same problem far too many people being let in and hardly able to walk down the main street.We had to go to Macdonalds to get anything to eat as no tables or capacity for eating anywhere in the park.We admit the exchange rate is poor at the moment but paying thousands of pounds to barely move around in the overcrowded park for 3 days is hardly worth it. Far better to save the money to go to Florida where the staff at least are friendly and welcoming and you can actually get on a ride in a reasonable time.",1
"Having bought some tickets via the internet before we went to Paris there was a problem with the website and we ended up with tickets that were only valid from when we came home. Phoned told no refund but would be accepted by desk in Paris but may be a small difference to pay. How wrong   treated as if two seperate organisations and had to buy new tickets full price (would have walked away but children would not have understood). Apart from ticket desk all staff very friendly with fixed smiles but park was diappointng as so much closed down. A very expensive day, park catering facilities expensive and typical American junk food.",1
"There is just shopping center and restaurantsThere is no deisny fun , just one park for walkingNo attractionFor each photo or game you must stay long time sometimes more than 1hPrice of the park and parking is highComparing with price there must be 5euro with free parking",1
"Just travelled in the October half term with my partner and two children aged 7 and 9. Booked a 5 day 4 night trip expecting to have a lot of fun   but there was almost none to be had. WAS THE WORST FAMILY HOLIDAY WE'VE EXPERIENCED. Many rides closed for maintenance. Many very dated and dull. Not enough to do and see for this length of trip. You should only need a day but queues would prevent you from getting on everything in this time.Long long queues for everything. No queue less than 30minutes even for the more minor attractions, over an hour (frequently 90 120minutes) for the big thrill rides. There were a few good moments: The big thrill rides (Space Mountain Crushes Coaster Aerosmith Tower of Terror) Rattatouille were great fun once you got on them   but these are of course only 2 3 minutes long at most and the fun:dull (queuing) ratio is very very low.The Motor show is good but a bit disappointing with lack of good finale.Backlot tour pretty impressive.Cinamagique films very goodMickey and the Magician goodStitch Live goodThe Disney Parade goodand we loved the night time light show .... that was very impressive.... but that's about all folks!We added up the fun moments and they totalled a very generous maximum of about 4 5 hours   not great when we were there for 5 days!!!!Many of the smaller rides are OK but just not good enough to be worth the wait.Armageddon awful   what was that about!!Jedi experience dull.Disney Junior Live awful lacking in energy and very dullWhilst Ratatouille was good it was clear there are major problems as seemed to breakdown on daily basis. Queued nearly 1 hour on one occasion to then have the ride fail and be closed!! What a terrible way to spend a holiday! Reduced me to tears that day!!Similar experience on Crushes Coaster!Where was the Frozen experience?!?! Ok there was a float but no other reference other than dresses for    80!Food overpriced and generally rubbish. Shops everywhere selling almost nothing other than overpriced Disney tat.No magic, no excitement.There could be entertainment for the queuing masses, street entertainment, original shops, disney characters walking the park (people employed to do this rather than stand manning yet another stall of rubbish merchandise), more shows catering for larger crowds (Go to Puy to Fou it's soooooooo much better) ..... I dodon't know what else but there's got to be some way of doing better than this.We could have had more fun in just one day at a local theme park (Drayton Manor or Alton Towers) for a fraction of the price.DOdon't GO! DOdon't WASTER YOUR TIME AND MONEY! DREADFUL DREADFUL DREADFULSo many more better thing to do with your life!!!!",1
Well wish could get money back. Took 3 young kids. So much more closed or broken down then ever on web site before booking. pirates of caribbean closed one day pinocio ride broken down two daysstar tours closedone station closedpirate boat couldnt walk aroundshooting galery broken and closedthunder mountain closedhalf seats of slinky dog ride brokenratatouille got fast pass ticket at 10am said come back for ride at 7.55 pm. with small kids? pocahontis village closedmesa riverboat closedThats some list erhh! kids very disappointed. Half term holidays so huge queues taking about 1hr per ride. As Disney before found staff very unfriendly to small kids lost the sparkle of true Disney. Characters hardly walked around anymore. meeting places took hours to have cuddle with them. Strollers prams well become so difficult now. used to offer single or doube stroller.    12    18. Now    20 single only. Then find cant take out park unless    50 deposit given. Then if take from one park you cant leave at another park as cant get deposit back so needs returning to same park. staff unhelpful and whole process useless as babies and young toddlers cant walk between village restaurants and park distance too great and stroller pointless. whom would steel stroller? they are solid and heavy and dont fold. Food and drink become total Mickey take for best words. Now so expensive for poor quality food or drink. vending machine coffee at too hotel price in horrid paper cup not even drinking lids like mac donald's do for    1. Really the park is looking tied. run down and staff need training. Nothing like Disney USA and just feel totally let down for my family and kids disappointed. Oh yer and broken down roller walkways to car parks leaving little kids so far to walk without help. left days with boards up at each end and no effort to fix. Shame on Disney. ,1
"We have just returned from a family trip to Disneyland Paris. My two sisters and I decided to take our daughters aged 4 6 and 7 for a day and night. Well firstly can I say that this trip is costly. Everything about Disneyland is expensive. It cost us over   50 per ticket for entrance into the park and what do you get for this??? It seemed like we were walking around a park with hardly any good rides. My first impressions was that it was dated. Have they not updated this park since it first opened 20 plus years ago. Disney you really need to move with the times. The castle is plastic looking and not real like. Where is the Disney characters waving from the balcony? The rides are out dated. We queued for some ride called Le Pays Des Contes De Fee, according to their leaflet it's not to be missed. Well it a small boat ride around some lame small wooden scenes from Disney movies. My daughter could have made in nursery. Where is the animations. Where is the 3D cinematic rides that take you through a journey of Disney film adventures. Where is the holographic Minnie and Mikey waving at you as enter the park? Where is the Elsa and Anna Characters? Your most successful Disney film to date and you havedon't decided to make a frozen castle? Where is the magic? All I saw was a couple of unpopular Disney characters in the park where you have to que hours to have a pic with. Mickey and Minnie well expect over a 2 hour queue to meet them. You should have a proper theatre auditorium where visitors can sit properly to see a property show. It seems Disney you have lost your magic, This park is not about the children this is a money spinner. Everything is about making money. We booked to have lunch with the Disney princesses 70 EUROS PER PERSON! The kids menu was Cinderella bites to start and pasta for main. Well what came out for our young kids to eat was laughable. Quails eggs and a load of salad leaves in a bowl. You call that Cinderella bites. Kids dodon't eat food like this. The pasta a tiny bowl of plain pasta with a small portion of tomato sauce on the side. What a disgrace. The manager said but you pay for the princess experience. Oh what Cinderella Ariel and sleeping beauty walking around the restaurant for half an hour. WHERE IS ELSA AND ANNA or your up to date characters. They should all be in the park every single day. This is a Sham! Sorry but I truly think Walt Disney would be turning in his grave. Bring back the real magic of Disney where kids truly experience good food and great quality attractions and entertainment. Why dodon't you bring in a macdonalds into the park and a pizza express? Decent food chains. Your greed means you are so lacking in quality. Very very dissappointed. I would say to a family saving all their hard earned cash to go. DONT BOTHER..",1
"Being disabled getting on rides weredon't so bad but to see any characters most were fully booked, but if your lucky you could find one to book but then you needed to work out where to be so not missing it, feels this could be avoided by booking timeslots at townhall office then you could plan better",1
"You have to pay a whole lot of money to get to Paris and to stay in Paris. Then you pay an absurd amount of money to enter Disney!For what, a whole lot of shops and very expensive restaurants. A lot closed attraction and after 18:30. The train, cabs and attraction Snow White are also closed! Personal doesdon't listen, the just speak.Never ever again! They can learn from the Efteling in Holland! Better atmosphere and vibe! ",1
"  far too comercial, it is not 'in' theese days, it will bunkrupt during next 10 20 years  admission and everything inside is too expensive  too crowded  long queues for train  lot of expensive and rubish food  not for adults, too boring  not worth visiti",1
90 euros a person to get in for one day (two parcs) which is bad enough. Upon entering the parc we discovered that most of the main attractions ie rides were closed it seemed the only places open along with the minor rides and attractions were either shops or restaraunts. With so many parts of both parcs closed there should have been notification before shelling out all that cash plus 20 euros just to park the car and or a reduced entry price to reflect the diminished state of the parcs,1
"Went for a weekend with my 13 year old daughter.Stayed at one of the on site hotels which entitled us to early entry between 8 10am.Arrived at gates at 8.15, which were closed and not open until 9am. By this time hundreds of people from the various hotels were all queuing. No updates or info given as to what was happening.Got to ticket office with my mobile voucher, then directed to customer services. Queued at customer services to be told I had to email then the voucher, even though they could see it on my phone. They did not have the facilities to scan it. This is one of the largest company's on the planet, but they dodon't have the facilities to scan mobile vouchers??!!My email was unable to sent it to them, I was told at this stage that it was my fault for not printing it out   great customer service!! The que was full of families in the same predicament. I had a 13 year old who although fed up tried to find a solution by sending it from her email. Other families were not so fortunate, toddlers were crying, parents were stressed and it was certainly not the happiest place on earth.When we finally got into the park, we had arranged to have breakfast there, there was no one the to ask directions. Many of the large rides were closed. Frontier land is basically a waste of time.I have been to the Florida Disney which is far superior to this. I would recommend you save your money and go to Florida. Give this pour imitation a miss.",1
"Last month (August 2016) was my second time ever at Disneyland Paris and Walt Disney Studios Park... I grew up going to the US parks (been to WDW and DL at least 20 times in my lifetime), havedon't been to any of the Disney parks located in Asia... I'm mentioning this as a reference point.Returning to Disneyland Paris was a terrible experience, it was my birthday and my girlfriend's first time ever at a Disney Park (I wanted to take her to WDW, but she's from South America and doesdon't have a US visa).The two main problems that we encountered where that there are many rude cast members (I would say about 40% of the ones we interacted with) and also that rides kept breaking down.Our first ride was Buzz Lightyear's at Tomorrowland.... it got stuck for at least 2 minutes halfway thru.The same happened with Haunted Mansion later in the evening... we only rode it once, and it got stuck twice! For about 2 minutes the first time and 5 minutes the second.The Ratatouille ride was also out of service for a couple of hours right in the middle of the day... we later returned and it was working fine.Had a reservation made over a month in advance at Chez Remy, it was for dinner but since we rode the attraction at about 3PM, we asked if we could see the place and the host with a smirk replied that it was  better  to wait to see it later, at the time we had our reservation so that it was a  surprise  for us... a  polite  way of saying  no ... because of this attitude we decided to have dinner elsewhere.We were also treated rudely by another cast member at the Aerosmith ride... I dodon't even want to write it because it will probably take too much of my time and I dodon't really want to remember it.After that I simply tried to stop interacting with cast members.Guests were also smoking everywhere around the park... something you dodon't usually see at the US parks... EVERYWHERE.One of the few positive things I can say about this park is that the castle is perhaps the prettiest and the Ratatouille ride is very good... but not worth traveling all the way to Europe for... You'll have a much more magical, authentic Disney experience at the US parks.",1
I bought tickets on the internet page of Disneyland Paris. We were terribly surprised when we visited both parks. Major attractions were under reconstruction. It was nowhere mentioned when I bought the tickets for full price. If I new this I would not fly in from the Czech Republic! This is a tricky behavior and I would not expect anything like this form Disneyland.,1
"Was here recently , at arrival we saw signages that a few of the attractions were closed . We had two tickets for two days . We hardly spent three hours and moved out Coz there is nothing much to do if you are a teenager and above your days of taking pictures with cartoons. Apart from the thrill rides which are very limited in number there is nothing great to do apart from clicking pictures and watching animated stuff. We did not even use the tickets for the second day as travelling all the way from Paris is a task and was not worth. We checked with the staff if we can return the tickets for the second day atleast but they would not accept it so had to walk off having paid about 160 175 EUROS per ticket and spent only about 3 4 hours . Not worth. ",1
"August 2016, Went to Disneyland Paris, Paid Full Price to Enter, only to find 50 % of the rides we wanted to go on were closed for Maintenance.Most of Frontier Land, ClosedThunder Mesa Riverboat Landing ClosedRiver Boat ClosedBig Thunder Mountain ClosedAdventure Land;Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom, ClosedSwiss Family Robinson Tree House, ClosedPirate Galleon, ClosedAdventure Island, ClosedPocahontas Indian Village, ClosedStar Tours, ClosedLa Galerie de la Bell au Bois Dormant, ClosedLes Voyages de Pinocchio, ClosedNo warnings on the Gate, Limited information in the park.If 1 2 the park is closed, you should only expect to pay 1 2 the entrance fee.",1
"I was very sad to see the conditions that the park was in. Many rides were closed, it was actually ridiculous the amount of rides (and very important ones closed).The other rides had technical problems constantly. Every day we would wait for more than 30min and when we where about to go to the ride, at least 3 rides per day they would say that there was a problem and they force you to leave. I was only given once a fast pass to go back, but the ride was out of service during the whole day so we coulddon't even ride it. Staff was rude, they dodon't even bother to explain it in English or Spanish and when they want to say something they do it in French and many of them in such a low tone it's imposible to even try to understand.I was worked in disney 2 years ago and I was very sad to see how it is now. I asked the people I used to work with and they told me that they were renovating the attractions for next year that will be disney's 25th anniversary. So if you really want to go, wait until next year because it was a mistake going now.",1
"Just diddon't enjoy the queues, poor customer service, closed attractions, lack of dining options and the underwhelming impression that the management coulddon't really care. Oh and bring your credit card as whilst the premium wodon't surprise you, the lack of value for money will. Frankly if you're going to Disney sob the real thing in the US. In Europe Phantasialand is so much better.",1
"Probably 2016 is the worst year ever for the following reasons :1  big attraction closed in the summer for renovation can you believe it in the vacation season !!2  most of attractions keeps failing for technical and would close for an hour or two3  due to points 1 & 2 all the rides are rushed now and duration cut in half to accommodate as many guests and lessen the queues , so after waiting for an hour to ride suddenly the whole ride takes a minute or two that you miss a lot and dodon't enjoyWorst year ever in Disney On the other hand the poor staff are trying to help in a very friendly way Renovations should have been done out of the peak season ",1
Extremely rude and threatning staff especially at the Princess Pavillion. Thomasz and Zaida are extremely rude and shout at families and children like animals.,1
"Being a lover of all things Disney, I was so excited about this visit. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. I expected long queues, everyone who goes to a Disney park comments on that, however, I was astounded by the sheer commercialism. Yes, souvenirs   great... but more souvenir shops than rides attractions? 40 euros for two hot dogs, two beers, one fries and one coke?! How does a family of 4 5 afford this?Blown away by the 2 HOUR QUEUE to have your photo taken with Mickey Mouse only to realise you had to pay for this privilege. The best bit for me was my Minnie Mouse ears which I proudly modelled all around Paris!",1
"My visit was in August     summer      Half of rides were under maintenance!!!  Adventureland & Frontierland were under maintenance all together!!!!  Workers are unprofessional and depressed, not like Disneyland Orlando experience!!!  I really dodon't recommend Disneyland Paris at all.......",1
"Not a good time to go. Online ticket machine scanner not working, so we waited over an hour at the guest relations window to get our online ticket scanned just to gain entry into the park. Extremely inefficient if you ask me, considering there were only several people in the line before us, and three windows servicing guests. Half the rides were closed for refurbishment or were not operating due to wet weather. All the large 'thrilling' rides were basically not operating. Some of these closures were not mentioned on the website either, so we came expecting to at least be able to enjoy some rides. We were left with the more family friendly rides which can be kind of a bore one after the other. We left the park at 5pm, the earliest I have ever left Disneyland. There really wasdon't much to do or see there. Extremely disappointing and not worth the money you pay to get in right now.",1
"Well, we visited the park on monday the 1st of august (first day of peak season) and there were a lot of rides and park zones closed for works, there was a big red crane at midday painting the pink castle. We woulddon't recommend the visit during high season (august) due to works and high entrance prices. Real images from yesterday.",1
I've been to both parks in the US and this place shoulddon't even have the same name. Nothing magical. I'd like to say the kids diddon't notice and loved it but they did feel the difference. I'd spend one day at most to minimize your frustration. Fun fact   my hotel had a scheduled power outage one day and we coulddon't use our room or the pool for hours. They really diddon't care.,1
"I was there for an hour before my iphone got stolen. I was queueing with my two year old who needed help, so I put all my things down on the ground and saw to him, and meanwhile someone came past the queue and stole my iphone, hat and jumper off the ground next to me. Nobody cared. I managed to find city hall, after being redirected four times, and they just wrote my number down on a piece of paper and a description   no help even though there are security guards EVERYWHERE   nobody was interested. I queued for three rides, Mickey mouse (40 minutes queue), the Teacups (25 minutes queue) and the Carousel (20 minutes queue) this was just after 10 in the morning, so we got there as early as it opened. Each ride was really fast   actually so fast I barely managed to take a few photos with my iphone (now stolen) before they ended   maybe 2 minutes maximum? I bought a hotdog at Casey's hotdogs, for 9.50euro (about 8 british pounds) and it was properly disgusting. The sausage was plastic, tough and rubbery, luke warm, and the bread was like plastic, tasteless, yeasty and boring. The  cheese  was nothing I had ever seen that came from an actual cow   more like yellow covered slime, and the crispy onions were saturated in greasy oil. I bought a small cup of popcorn for 5 euro, again, it was greasy, bland, tasteless and actually, I left it on a seat because I coulddon't be bothered carrying it on all the queues, where I had to leave my 20 euro hired stroller behind and carry all my things, including my two year old son, through the enormous queues. My son wanted to meet Mickey Mouse, but there was a half an hour queue and I said no. Temper tantrum ensured but I was tired, alone, and in a large place that felt really unfriendly and all about show and making money, not about wonderment. The staff really diddon't care. The ticket cost 84 euro for me for the day, it surely wasdon't worth that. Many of the rides were shut, and you have to walk for miles around all the construction walls that are up. My recommendation? Hell on earth. Please dodon't waste your money. Go to Paris, see the Eiffel tower, walk along the river, go to Notre Dame   give your children a brain, not an empty wallet.",1
"I love Disney but was really ,really disappointed this visit when my two favourite rides were both out of action at the same time !!! When you are travelling with teenagers it meant that they were too bored with the other parts of the part too quickly and it soon list its magic on a four day stay ! Have to say this was really poor   several other main attractions out of action too   surely these maintenance operations could be timed better ! Was really excited about this holiday and have to say it fell flat   disappointing beyond belief !",1
"I was recently made redundant from my job of 15 years. I have 2 daughters aged 24 and 21 and we are huge Disney fans. We have visited Orlando on a few occasions when they were younger. I decided that I would use some of my redundancy money to fund a Disney trip as a treat. I could not afford Orlando so we booked a trip to Disneyland Paris and the three of us were very excited about it. The trip was a catastrophic disappointment. We stayed at the New York Hotel which was lovely   no real complaints there. We were offered the free meal plan which I upgraded to the Plus Plan.We arrived on Tuesday 28th June quite late and decided we would go into Disney Village for our evening meal. We decided to use our vouchers at Annette's. Whilst the food was lovely the service was unacceptable. We were served by a young waiter who advised us what we could order from the menu. I explained that I am vegetarian and so he said I could have the Veggie Burger, I asked if if was possible to change the toppings on the burger, the response was  no . Nothing else, just  no . We ordered drinks and I ordered a lemon fanta. Again the response was  you cadon't have that on your meal plan . I was very taken aback as this is not the kind of service I expect when in Disney. The food was lovely but the service left me feeling like I was a pauper expecting welfare handouts. It sullied the whole meal. I would have been prepared to pay for anything extra we wanted but that clearly was not an option.Nevermind, we thought, tomorrow is another day. We'll have fun in Disney Studios. How wrong we were. We arrived at the park at 11.30am, attempted to get into a Cinemagique and Art of Animation experience to be told to come back at 12 o clock. We then moved onto and spent the first half an hour queueing to get into the Armageddon  ride . It was absolutely rubbish. We coulddon't understand a word that was being said and had expected so much more based on our Orlando experience. The day then goes from bad to worse. We next went to the Rock n Roller Coaster and expected to queue for one hour according to the notices. However, the ride broke down and so it was more like 2 hours that we queued. We next went to the  Behind the Scenes  tram experience and queued up for 20 minutes to then be told to go away as the ride had broken down. We were feeling very despondent and let down by this time. We moved around to Crush's coaster and queued up for half an hour to be told again that the ride had broken down and to go away and come back later. We decided to go into the Toy Story section of the park. More disappointment when we realised the Indy Car ride was closed for refurbishment. Never mind we thought, we'll go on the Parashute Drop. Can you guess what happened? After 45 minutes of queueing we were told that the ride had broken down and to come back later. By now this had totally ruined our day. We decided to try Crush again and after one and half hours of queuing we managed to get on the ride. Earlier in the day, around 3 o clock we had tried to get a fastpass for Ratatouille as the queue time was 2 hours but even though the park had 4 hours before it closed there were no fast passes available. So we spent nearly 8 hours in Disney Studios and only managed to get on 3 rides. Not exactly Disney standards or our money's worth.We were still unsure about the meal plan after our experience at Annette's and so decided to pay for a meal at Planet Hollywood instead that evening to cheer ourselves up.The next day we went into Disneyland Park with hopes that we might have a good day. We queued for 45 minutes for Buzz Lightyear (the wait time said 15 minutes). My girls were excited for some of the bigger rides and so we raced over to Space Mountain: closed. More disappointment. We raced over to Star Tours: closed. It goes on: Casey Jr: closed. Big Thunder Mountain: closed. Pirate Galleon: closed. Robinson Tree House: Closed. Peter Pan: Closed. Riverboat landing: closed. What a huge disappointment. We spent 12 hours in the park and the only rides we managed to get on were Indiana Jones after a horrific queue (no wonder as no other thrill rides were open) and Pirates of the Caribbean. We tried to get a fastpass for Indiana Jones at 2pm and bearing in mind that the rides diddon't close til 10 that evening there were none left!We also ate in Blue Lagoon and I ordered the only vegetarian dish available and it came in a fish sauce so coulddon't eat it.The whole trip was a huge disappointment from start to finish. Well over 50% of the big thrill rides were closed and added to that the number of rides that broke down we only managed a measly 5 rides after spending a total of 20 hours in the parks.This trip was meant to be a memory making trip for my daughters and I and it made all the wrong sort of memories. I dodon't think a review can fully get across the true disappoinment of the trip.I feel that my money has been taken under false promises. We booked with the intention of getting a Disney experience. Blackpool Pleasure Beach would have done better.I wrote to the CEO a week ago and havent even received an acknowledgement.",1
"I am currently trying to find the best place to formally complain about my recent break to Disney land Paris.I honestly dodon't know where to begin with the list of complaints..........The security on entering the park is fairly non existent. There were 4 adults and 4 children in our group and most days they ushered us through with out any checks at all. Given recent circumstance this left us slightly nervous. The park looks almost shut with boarding up EVERYWHERE saying under renovation for your future enjoyment. The majority of the large rides were shut, restaurants all around closed up, and some of the big shows again closed!This caused the queues at the remaining rides and shows to be insane. A serious lack of staff throughout the park leading to smoking everywhere even though it states it is non smoking. We stayed 5 days and due to the closures and queues we were only able to appreciate around 50% of the parks.Horrendous and costly experience.My advise is dodon't go.",1
"First, the price you pay at the entrance is more than 50 pct than the internet price, with no obvious mention of it on their website. 75 euros instead of 47...Then, most of the attractions, included the biggest, were closed   supposedly for maintenance ! Star wars, space mountain, Adventure Island, Pirates Galleon, Pocahontas village, Robinson's hut, and several others ! Therefore the queues were long for the few opened activities even if it was a low attendance day. More than 45 minutes for Indiana Jones, more than an hour for a picture with Donald.... We felt utterly ripped off. ",1
I went in Disneyland and Disney studios last June.. everything was very well but not the Ratatoille... it was unuseful... I am sick so I have just a bit time to spend in this life... all my money went to this vacancy on Disneyland. Also  white snow attractions  was cracked.. and in toy story world my boyfriend and my daughter were blocked in the attraction because a guy forgot his bag. They were scared of a bomb.,1
If you have older children they will be very disappointed as all but 2 rides were closed. Waste of money. Expected so much more. They should not be allowed to charge full price. Total rip off!!!,1
"I was ready to pay and children ready to enjoy. But Disney let us down. They took the money all right but they were not able to handle the number of visitors in the park. Most of the day we spend in line and in a period of 8 hours we were able to try 3 rides. Same scenario the following three days : (We have been to Disney in the US, and it seams that they are more ready for the high numbers of visitors.",1
"I have been there few times and each time I regret. If you stay 8 hours there, you will enjoy attraction for 30 mins, remaining time is for waiting only",1
"Our family has visited every Disney Park in the US, and looked forward to visit the one In Paris.This was i big disapointment. Several of the main attractions were closed due to maintenance. This caused ques up to three hours on other attractions. Both reservations for dinner was lost, even though we had booked months ago. The food served was terrible and overpriced. We stayed for two nights at the Disney New York Hotel. This was OK. But we were promised two hours exclusive time in the park every morning for Hotel guests. When we turned up, the main areas for teenage kids were not open. A total rippoff!!Paying good money for these days were not worth the hours we spent standing in endless lines.We will never return to Disneyland Paris or Disney Studios.",1
"they have made it in two parts, the Disney studio and walt Disney park. but the walt Disney park has nothing, it is waste of land. all the good rides were closed for maintanence. we Indians should go to hongkong Disney which is faaar far better and you will have a feel of Disney. they have every thing is Disney shape., all characters are always roaming and you can interact. the paris Disney is just big in size and they are not able to justify .",1
"Five things to think about before going.This is not a Disney park, just to be clear about that so you dodon't end up in disappointment when you dodon't see any characters or hardly anything else that reminds you of Disney.You still want to go? Next to do is check which rides that are open, at the 27e june there was so many out of order, and it wasdon't just a bad day, most it's planed. 5 8!! of the thrill rides was out. Well you still hanging in for going, then book on internet, it's more then half price. But even with that make sure to have your Big pocket with you, they will try to charg   you for everyting. Have a bag to put items in pocket, no safety boxes at the rides.After this checklist dodon't forget I warned you, this is the short list of how bad this park is, there is more to discover (there is more reviews at their Facebook if you not trust me) so now it's up to take your patience and go, you will definitely need it.",1
"This was my second visit, my first visit was way back in 10 yrs ago and I had great memory from my last visit. I've expected bit like disneyworldish disneyland.. probably my expectation made much more disappointed.. Today it is late Jun which is considered as beginning of high season. More then half of the attractions and restaurants were closed. Here is the worse part, there were like one or two thrill rides were opened today including disney studio parks. Also rides suddenly stopped more than three times while I was riding rides through out the day. (One had to get off from the ride cuz they were not able to reoperate it)Also non of guests respected designated smoking area. I had headaches from queue line out side of building cuz ppl were smoking even in the lines. Well from this experience, I guess I will never coming back to disney land paris. This park is far off from the other disney lands standards.",1
"It's a total rip off!!! 12 rides were closed for refurbishment, the rides that are left are basic fairground rides with a Disney theme. Dodon't get ripped off go to a different theme park, save money & have a better day    ",1
"Unless you are positive about all  refurbishing  attractions has ended, AVOID THIS PLACE at all costs or you will be scammed like us: more than 6 rides in Disneyland Studios have been closed for weeks (I diddon't know this when I booked my vacations last October) and many other run the same luck at Disneyland Park.Moreover, parades look cheap and unprepared, prices are outrageous and rides are all fashioned.I've been here before in 1997 and I am positive they havedon't invest a dime in new attractions.STAY AWAY! Go to Disneyworld @ Orlando,Fl for an unmatched experience!",1
The staff here is very rude and racist they dodon't know how to talk   We indian are very big spender I think Disney Paris does not need Indian tourists   So all Indian groups big no to Disney Paris,1
"If you want to make your kids disappointed Disney Paris is def. your place to go!!! Im sorry but we been in Florida many times but this one is not even close to that disney. We not enjoying to stand in the line for hours just to have pictures with Donald, or Mickey. Way to overpriced for NOTHING! cheap and tired rides. Approximately 40% of the park is closed, and the stuff is not nice at all... ",1
"As I child I went to the Disney World in Florida and it was one of the most magical things I can ever remember. So on our way to a French holiday with relatives, we booked 2 nights (at the Vienna Magic Circus which was fab but different review) and a 1 day 2 park pass. Our boys (6 and 4) first visit we were so excited and we had a loose plan of what we wanted to do especially with height restrictions. Few days before noticed a lot was closed like Peter Pan and Space Mountain, disappointed but already booked so not much we could do and we had never been before so diddon't realise how bad this would be until there. We hit the Studio park first and the rides that were open like Ratatouille waited 55mins with a 4yr old already doing so well but haddon't even got on and were evacuated off as it had broken down. Went straight to Crush Coaster and after 20mins same thing happened it broken down. We headed to Toy Story Parachute and Hollywood Tower but there were over 90mins waits because there was nothing else running so everyone was hitting them. Advertised as a midi day (a May Friday not in school hols) but coulddon't see how they could have got ANY more people in the parks and it was 25C so even getting a bottle of water was a mission and more queing. We went over to the Disney park hoping to at least see some characters but unlike my friend said a few months ago they are not walking about anymore it's a ... You guessed it, Que system at least 55mins alll day to see Mickey. So by now it's 1pm and the boys have done NOTHING, except que but been on no rides or seen any characters! My 6yr old just broke down I actually have a video of him saying  Disneyland isdon't as fun as I thought  it was heartbreaking. We ended up going on 3 small rides like Small world and the Tea cups (can pay   1.50 at our local fun fayre to do) and watched the parade but all we did the whole day was que in boiling sun and ply the kids out of guilt with ice creams, treats and hot dogs (4 plain hot dogs, 2 bottles of water and a Coke 41E and a 30mins wait!!) more money in Disney's pocket though as you're trapped... very clever. We were told it was open until 10pm so after the parade Bee lined for the studio again to try Ratatouille but that park closes at 6pm!! No one mentioned this. I had tried to get fast passes but all gone and we spoke to a few who had got them for Ratatouille but they coulddon't use them as it was broken down anyway, I did complain as we left but they diddon't want to know. We gave up then, boys could barley speak from exhaustion and they had spied Planet Hollywood in the village which we then bigged up as  Pizza planet  from Toy story as they diddon't get to see Buzz and Woody as hoped. Again 35min wait for a table then over an hour for our food, even the waiter was apologising. 100E for greasy pizza and a few drinks. Totally devastated for my boys feel I totally let them down by building up so much doing big reveal bags with outfits etc WOULD NOT return, total rip off.",1
"If you love your children please dodon't let Disneyland Paris be their first  Disney  experience. I go to a Disney park at least once a year and I always LOVE them. I do not understand why Disney even has their name on this park. The service at Disneyland Paris is deplorable even for French standards. Additionally, if you want your children to get a large dose of second hand smoke take them to Disneyland Paris.The only positive thing about Disneyland Paris is they sell alcohol in the park. You do have to buy food with it so expect to buy a round of beers with a single donut. Additionally, it was nice that the train goes straight to Disneyland from Paris. This has been on my bucket list for years and it certainly is not worth the money even for the biggest Disney fans.",1
"With over half the rides being refurbished and the rest becoming very dated,this park has had its day. I hope for the site's sake the refurbishment significantly change the park and reduce disappointed visitors. If I thought my complaints would be responded to I would make a lot of noise and demand my money back. Come on Disney sort it out!",1
"Well what a disappointment. We have just finished a 3 day visit to Disneyland Paris and have come away very disappointed and deflated. So what went wrong. Firstly we picked the wrong week. You would think that booking in May June you would have had some decent weather but no 3 days of heavy rain with the occasional thunderstorm nothing Disney could have done about that really but what was annoying is the profit they must have made on the sales of poncho rain coats at 10 euros a throw. Nearly everyone had to buy one as the weather was so bad. The most annoying thing was on our arrival 19 of the 45 attractions were closed for refurbishment. This included Star tours our favourite ride in Orlando , big Thunder mountain , the dragon ride , autopia, adventure island , Aladdin, Peter Pan,pirate beach Pocahontas village,rock and roll coaster to name a few. It just felt like everything good was closed. Why oh why could they have not planned this better and just had 1 or maybe 2 attractions closed at a time. Walking round and seeing everything boarded up was heartbreaking for my little boy. Well and truly disappointed especially after spending well over   2000 of our hard earned money on a 5 day getaway. ",1
Please save your money and go somewhere else!! It is full of ignorant people who do not know how to queue. Some of the people would literally stand on your kids to get to the front to see anything that is happening. There is no communication on the park to inform you of what is happening. If your child wants to meet Mickey Mouse you have to pay extra money on top of what you have already paid to get into the park in a restaurant. The rides are not always open (even when weather good) you queue for over an hour for a 30 second ride (no exaggeration). The toilets are disgusting. I am not a moaner but honestly this holiday has been the worst we have ever been on my kids (13 & 6) wanted to go home after 2 days so that must say something.,1
"Just arrived at Disneyland Paris. We are a family of 7 with 4 small children. Hotel   fine and friendly. Ventured in to the park to get something to eat. We are in the self service pizza restaurant. We have been standing in a queue for 45 minutes and we are still 10 from the front! They have just 2 tills open out of a total of 10 available. The supervisor Valerie is embarrassed and apologetic but explained that this is the best she can do with the people she has available. I'm not sure whether she means quantity, quality or both. There is zero evidence of management let alone leadership. Whoever is heading up this part of the Disney operation needs either to 1. Be fired or 2. Have a strong word with themself. There are thousands of catering establishments around the world to learn how to serve delicious food quickly and efficiently (for example ski resorts, airports, Eataly). I suggest someone from Disneyland Paris urgently gets themselves on a research mission or recruits an expert. We are now 3 from the front of the queue. I hope the food is better than the service!",1
"Do not book at the moment.the park is having a MAJOR refit ready for it's anniversary. Half the rides are closed. No Peter Pan, no Pirate ship no Swiss family Robinson treehouse,no Thunder Mountain, main station station closed, no autopia, no adventure Isle, no Aladin, Rock and Roller coaster Aerosmith, no Rustler roundup shooting gallery, no Star tours,. This was bad enough we paid extra to stay in a disney hotel to get in the Park early.Waste of time. It's a Small World opens at 10. Pirates of the Caribbean opens at 10, Disney Studios ( the whole Park! ) opens at 10..... Absolutely shocking. I also paid half board....which was ok as an adult, but for the kids they had pretty much the same three choices no matter which restaurant they went to.....pasta burger pizza.....this is not very imaginative and it was a rip off. Definitely wait til the anniversary....I felt ripped off. R",1
"Having been to Disney before I was so looking forward to it but once arriving I was to be in for a major shock the ques were terrible 70 mins plus for rides even with ur fast past it's not much better waiting to see charachters with an exc 8 year old to get half way there after waiting 30 mins for them just to walk off and tell u will be bk at 4pm, the rudeness of peo is terr I wodon't be in a hurry to be bk ",1
The lady staff at call center disneyland was very rude and unhelpful. I need some directions and she cant be bothered to help and was very insulting to the customer. Worst customer service I have ever received.,1
"Visited on 17th May. Expensive to enter and were not informed half the attractions were closed to the public. Queued for half an hour to be told by young lady that they were closing it. No explanation or apology when asked why ? Having already visited Disneyland, Orlando which was a lovely experience compared to Disney Paris which needs to review prices and not to rip off public who cannot use attractions. Cleanliness and staff attitude needs to be reviewed. Was going to pay for my niece and family to visit Disney Paris but would certainly not consider this establishment for them or myself.",1
More than 15 rides are closed and the park over sells the entry tickets way more than its capacity to handle. No one inside to help or guide you. Huge queue for certain rides having wait time of more than two hours.,1
1 3 of the rides are shut. We complained on our return to get a reply 2 months later telling us we should have checked and they are making improvements for their 25th anniversary   basically we dodon't care that your daughter was disappointed. Not the Disney spirit at all. Check what is closed before you go   the number of closed rides means the queues are worse than normal and the fast passes are all gone by 11 for the most popular rides. If we'd have been made aware that so much was closed when we booked (directly with them) we would not have gone,1
"We paid full price while 16 !! attractions were closed for renovation. Also restaurants were closed, so it took us 1,5 hours to wait for our food... It was sunny and warm, one would expect all icecream shops would be open, h  las! Waiting hours were sometimes 220 minutes, which is expected when 1 3 of all attractions is closed! Fast pass check in for the same day had to be arranged before 11am, no possibilities to use your fast pass for the next day. To know about the renovated attractions, you have to dig deep on their website. Expensive, crowded and dissapointing, those were the main impressions of all our family.",1
"Spent the best part of Saturday at Disneyland and left feeling very disappointed. It seems for every ride, there are at least five restaurants or shops. It's hard not to feel you're walking through a massive money racquet.An awful lot of the attractions were closed for refurbishment, which meant the queues for the remaining ones were ridiculous. A forty minute queue just for the teacups is not fun.After 40 minutes waiting in line for Thunder Mountain, the queue started moving rapidly. We were being shepherded to the exit with a member of staff saying  You all have to leave . We assumed a technical fault was to blame, but staff were not forthcoming with any sort of explanation.We only got to go on four rides all day due to the extreme waiting times and they were largely not worth the wait.Food mediocre and overpriced, but this was expected. The park was annoying to navigate, with little signage and several blocked paths due to refurbishment.Characters were at specific photo points and again, queues were ridiculously long. We coulddon't understand why some of the staff standing round chatting to each other coulddon't have thrown on another costume and just stayed away from their counterpart to let children and big kids have more of an opportunity to meet and greet.A frustrating day all in all, lacking in any of the Disney Magic we had hoped for. I would recommend Portaventura over Disneyland a thousand times over.",1
"We went as part of a group tour so this visit was planned for us. As the title states, many of the attractions were closed for maintenance or remodeling and will be for many months. The ones that were working were overcrowded and prone to breaking down. We got stuck in the haunted mansion for about 20 minutes and Buzz Lightyear was stop and go. Peeling paint and tattered banners. Not the level that one would expect from the Disney name. Too few staff and too many guests. Even though attractions were reduced, the admission prices were not. No reason to go here. If you are going to go, at least do an internet search for the complete list of closed attractions and the schedule of repairs so you will not be too disappointed.",1
"Having been many times to the the park, we were looking forward to going for a short break in May. I wish we had not bothered. The park is undergoing a lot of renovations of which they did not inform us many of the attractions were closed. Rocking roller coaster, big thunder mountain, Main Street station, Peter Pan just to name a few. The work has walkways closed from one area of the park to another so you have to walk back the way you came. The wait time was over 90mins on many rides due to the lack of attractions open. The staff were grumpy and not very Disney at all. I will not be returning as I feel it is no longer Disneyland. We returned home to find items purchased in the park store were not in our bags. I contacted them with full details of missing item and receipt details to be told there's nothing they can do. Be warned check your purchases!!",1
"I just spent the day at Disneyland Paris with my 2 children, aged 11 and 14. We are from Canada and have been to Disneyland in California three times. We were very excited to have a Disney experience while in Europe. Unfortunately, we were not impressed. We read prior reviews and went on a Wednesday in May to avoid crowds. This paid off as there were almost no queues and we could get right on most rides. Unfortunately, half the restaurants and at least 20% of the rides were closed. It was like a ghost town. The staff were unfriendly and some were actually rude. The place was dirty. Toilet paper dispensers were empty and there was garbage on the floor in some areas. It was like a dirty ghost town   every second place was closed down! I have celiac disease and one of the wonderful things about Disney is that they are very respectful and accommodating of this. I would not recommend that anyone with celiac disease try to eat at Disneyland Paris at all. The restaurants had no food that wasdon't battered and deep fried and I coulddon't find a salad anywhere. It was awful. We ended up eating at the expensive restaurant next to Pirates of the Caribbean. The food was disgusting   neither of my kids could eat even half of it. I'm certain that it is just frozen food that they microwave and serve. My tasteless dinner was served in a microwaved cardboard package   clearly a pre packaged, inedible meal. We are not fussy eaters   we are happy with most things   but this was by far the worst meal any of us have ever had in our lives. In California Disneyland is an experience. The guest is overwhelmed by the cleanliness and loveliness of the surroundings. You truly feel transported to a magical place. It is amazing. This place in France should not be called Disneyland. It is a disgrace to the name. I understand that many people are happy with Disneyland Paris and I believe that they have likely not been to Disneyland California. If I haddon't experienced the California park, I might have been happy with the Paris one, but it really is a disappointment for those who have been to both. I really dodon't understand how Disneyland Paris could go so wrong   the Disney brand is being devalued by this place.",1
This park is a huge merchandise operation with some dated rides spotted around. We arrived at 10 am for the park opening and the crowds were already huge. There were times when the crowds were so think we were gridlocked. That meant waiting in line for a minimum of 90 minutes even with fast pass. We were there all day and one child only went on four rides and the other went on six. The lines to the rides were one thing but the lines for the restaurants were equally daunting with up to 30 minutes wait for really bad food. Then there were the lines for the characters which were on a schedule. So my kids diddon't get a photo with any because we're always too late for the timings. 25% of the rides were under repair and some of them broke down and had to be closed momentarily. The parades were ok but the park needs refurbishing. Save your money and go to the Disney in Florida.,1
"Disney is getting worse and worse. Endless waiting time, tons of closed attractions, unpleasant staff... Nothing might save the day. I definitely will NOT go back to this living inferno",1
"We basically paid 200 euros and wasted 1 of our days in Paris to go to a closed park. The only major attraction open was Space Mountain: Mission 2. Every other major ride was closed for maintenance, even the haunted mansion was closed. We literally walked all the way around the park from closed for maintenance sign to closed for maintenance sign. A complete waste of money, and time.",1
"I stayed at Disneyland Paris from 5 4 2016   9 4 2016. I was with a group of 5 adults and 2 children ages 5 & 8 I was aware that certain attractions were closed before we travelled from the information supplied on Disney Paris Website. But when we were there at least half of the attractions were closed including ALL the childrens Play areas, Swiss Family Robinson, Pirate Beach, Adventure Isle, Pocahontis Indian Village, this meant the children had no where to play. This also meant that the rides which were open had longer than normal queues 55   90 mins 30mins for fast pass. We were lucky to get on 3 rides a day. The children were fed up of queing The full list of closures wasdon't disclosed before we booked had it been we most definately woulddon't have booked. The food in the parks is very expensive rubbish paid    256 in Cafe Mickey for a cold awful meal, we was given free coffee because it was so bad. I cadon't believe that this is part of the same Company as Disneyland Florida there is no comparison my advice is dodon't waste your time and money on this dreadful place",1
"I've been to all the Disneyland theme parks and this is the worst park ever! I had an issue with my friends ticket and I needed it addressed and the supervisor was very rude and even yelled at me telling me that I should've bought the ticket for full price at the gate instead of the cheap one on their website. He diddon't care if I would complain, so here I am! His name is William and he wears glasses and is balding. Secondly, this park encourages secondhand smoke because no one did anything to stop the teenagers and adults from smoking in front of the children or on the rides. Thirdly, their restaurant staff are all slow and I've seen them just chitchating in the back with our order in their hands, but they bring it out 5 minutes later. Fourthly, half the park was closed for reconstruction and half the stalls were closed until noon.. I understand the construction but why were half of the stalls closed?Regardless, this is d finitely not a Disneyland I would recommend.",1
"I diddon't count, but I bet that there are more shops then attractions. In diddon't like the atmosphere: so many morose people and whining children.   Very long waiting periods while not even in high season.   Not anxious to go back any time soon.",1
"Horrible place, run down. It's like it was built in the 90s and nothing has changed. Apart from there are more hotels and nowhere to sit and eat. No characters about, unless you go to designated areas and queue for an hour. Even then nothing is relevant to today's children. The food is all fast food, no salad, veg or sugar free drinks in sight. I'm a diabetic and found it impossible. The coffee was disgusting apart from the 1 Starbucks on sight. There are no newsagents or even a pharmacy. If your child is ill, tough! The hotels are basic, large windows that open all the way in and children can hang out. Even on first and second floor. The electrics must have been fitted and tested by the chuckle brothers. Worst holiday ever. I sat in the bath and cried every night while the kids slept. Avoid the place, it's a waste of money, hopes and dreams. ",1
Do not go and waste your time and money. Over half of the rides were not working. Two broke down when we were on them. The queues were over an hour long on each ride. The fast passes machines were shut down later in the day. A plat du jour was E69. It was a nightmare. Having been to 2 other Disneyland this is a disgrace.,1
"I am writing this with a heavy heart having visited this attraction practically every year at Easter for the past 10 years. In fact, we were so disappointed by our experience this time that we probably wodon't be going back. WHY?With three kids, all under the age of 12, we go there for the rides. However, the following were all closed last week:Practically everything at FRONTIERLAND including:1. Big Thunder Mountain (Fastpass)2. Phantom Manor3. Thunder Mesa Riverboat Landing4. Pocahontas Indian VillageMost of ADVENTURELAND including:5. La Cabane des Robinson6. Pirates' Beach7. Adventure IsleAt FANTASYLAND:8. Peter Pan's Flight (Fastpass)And at DISCOVERYLAND:9. Star Wars (Fastpass)So of the 6 feature attractions (Fastpass), HALF OF THEM WERE CLOSED. And the total (9) equates to about a third of the park!And to compound this, with tickets for access to both parks, the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster (Faspass) at Walt Disney Studios were closed too! They do publish attractions that are closed on their website so CHECK FIRST BEFORE BOOKING YOUR HOLIDAYS! We always go at Easter to avoid the busy summer queues, which we find unbearable. This Easter was unusually quiet   I guess in part due to the closure of so many rides and additionally the recent atrocities in France and Belgium. However, despite this, those who were there were queuing for less rides open, so queues were as long as they usually are.We managed to get on to about 10 rides each in a day. At   270 in entry fees (1 day, 2 parks) for the 5 of us (2 adults, 3 children), that's   27 per ride. Good value for money? Not when you consider that among these 10 were things like the Carrousel and Tea Cups, you might want to consider visiting your local fun fair or UK theme parks. Especially when you add your transport, hotel and food expenses, it presents the prospect of going to Disneyland Paris in a very negative light.We had a VIP Fastpass from a previous visit which they issue to guests that stay in their swanky suites, thinking that we could use it this time. However, they no longer issue or honor these, so it seems that there is very little incentive to spend any money with them on accommodation either. Fortunately, we stayed at a better hotel (and there are plenty nearby) off site for far less!And when I'd asked their representatives at the information centre (City Hall) as to why there were so many closures, they were well rehearsed in objection handling stating text book responses that they are getting ready for the summer and their 25th anniversary, that rides were getting tired and that closures were published on their website etc ... So what about us then? In light of these closures, why were we charged MAGIC rates (which is not the cheapest tariff)? It seems that Disneyland are still hell bent on cashing in on the hard earned cash of working families who can only travel during school holidays! I hope that in writing this long (and perhaps rambling) review that some of you may think twice as to whether you want to visit, and if you do when you plan to visit the theme park.If you still do, a few tips:1. Save yourself some money and stay at at a hotel or serviced apartment off site. You can always prepare a picnic and return back to the car park (where there is a picnic area nearby) for lunch   dinner.2. Plan ahead by checking their website for closures and devise an itinerary accordingly. Otherwise, you'll end up walking around aimlessly and queuing unnecessarily (as we did this time). 3. Get yourself a Fastpass as early as possible to cut down your queuing time later. You can only secure one Fastpass at any one time (this was not the case before) but if you get an early return time, you may be able to get another for a different attraction before they are fully allocated for the day. The newer attractions like Ratatouille are always very popular.4. Make sure you dodon't miss the Parade (5.30 pm last week) and stick around for the light show   firework display when the park closes (10 pm).",1
"We have been to Orlando several times and love the parks there especially the Disney parks.So seeing as we were in Paris for a few days we thought that we would go to Disney land Paris.What a disappointment, we went on Wednesday 6th April 2016 the connection by train from Paris was good but that's where the good bits end until we left.There was no characters walking about, all the staff looked board and unhappy, the lady on the studio tram tour was rude to us then sat there huffing and puffing for the whole ride, there is no sparkle or magic about the place, it looked worn out.There was several rides shut down and this is not on considering how much money it cost to get in, as said in a previous review it was like one big merchandise shop.I dodon't believe the park should be open or the tickets should be massively reduce to account for the amount of attractions not open.If you have ever been to Orlando like us dodon't wast your your money here it's nowhere near the same in any way shape or form.",1
I recently spent 4 days at both Disney Parks with 3 children and we also stayed in a Disney Hotel (Davy Crockett Ranch) so I feel justified in writing a review. The experience was quite simply atrocious. I mean absolutely abysmal. I build product teams for a living and if I had been involved in putting out such a sub par product I would be ashamed. Here is a brief list of the problems   1. Rides that were closed Aerosmith roller coaster closed Animagique closed Star Wars ride closed Thunder Mountain closed Big Mesa Waterboat closed Peter Pan Ride closed Pirate Island playground closed Pocahontas playground Future land train station closed Swiss Family Robinson closed Andy RC racer closed Pizza Planet closed Agrabah cafe closed Horse Drawn a arrives closed Main Street train closedFuete Restaurant Closed2. Rides that broke down Disney Juniors broke down 30 seconds before the start...literally 30 seconds with no apology and nearly 100 crying kids who had waited for upwards of an hour Ratatouille ride broke down after 40 minute wait Slinky roller coaster closed early at 4pm Magic carpets fast pass machine out of order Monsters Inc scream o meter out of order Magic Carpet ride   three of the carpets malfunctioned and refused to rise; parents had to complain 80 minute wait for Nemo roller coaster and no fast pass available 3. Issues with meals   eating Restaurant booking system broke down across the park on Tues 5th meaning could not make reservations to use meal tickets Restaurant reservations were only taken in person in the restaurant....genius idea except Davy Crockett ranch is 5 miles from the park... The team time snack for Disney Studios is redeemable in only one restaurant which had counters closed during the peak period of 3 6 with an average 20 minute wait Under 3's eat free...except at Davy Crockett Ranch where under 3's are given Apple pur  e for the duration of the holiday. Saw a customer being refused to trade his baguette for a packet of cornflakes No cornflakes available on third day 4. General criticisms There are more merchandise shops open than rides   that is unacceptable Every restaurant is used a way to sell merchandise which generates awful queues The kids area of Disney Studios (Playland) is 1 3 of the size of the adults area with tight lanes and steps whilst the adults area (Armageddon) is wide boulevards. Who thought that up?! No characters to greet people on entry or exit to the park over any of the four days. Seriously? I mean not one character to greet guests? Walked around both parks for 4 days and we saw two characters   Pluto and Marie from Aristocats. That is simply unacceptable. Summary Without doubt one of the worst experiences of a theme park I have ever had. Basically; 3 children spent four days looking for mockery mouse and the only place they saw him was on the merchandise you ram down customers throats after the rides break down. You should be ashamed.,1
"Be sure to get the correct train ticket. Even though I ordered our tickets at a booth (in both ENG and FR) the ticketer sold us the wrong tickets. When we got to Disneyland Paris, not only did we have to buy the correct train ticket, we had to pay a fine.WARNING: Do not buy your tickets online the same day you are going because they will not accept the ticket. They also will not let you exchange the ticket at the gate to a day ticket.Wasdon't aware of the online ticket restriction and had to go back to the ticket line to purchase day tickets (over 2hrs wait). Was never able to get a refund so in addition to wasting a lot of time, we were out a couple hundred of dollars.Park is smaller than Disneyland in CA. In addition, there was no notice that about half of the park was under renovation so there was not much to do! Finished the park within 3 4hrs.I reserved a late lunch at Bistrot Chez R  my and the service was atrocious. Food was mediocre. Cute decor though.The whole experience was the worst on our Euro trip. My BF is anti Disney while I'm a big fan so it diddon't help my argument. Woulddon't recommend.",1
"I visited with 5 other people in February, 2016. I have never been so disappointed in a visit. I have previously been several times to Disneyland Paris when I was younger, so I was quite looking forward to visiting again. How niave I was. It was far, FAR too busy and the ride times (and qualities) reflected this. A two hour wait for a ride on average, many of those rides closed and the quality of the rides was a little bit of a letdown because of this. The fast track system, much like other parks, is an excellent idea. However because of the park being at over capacity, the fast track points were closed by 11.00am as they were all used up. The food was over priced and the park full of people smoking (despite being banned in the park   much like the 'selfie stick' and staff did nothing to rectify those who did). A very disappointing experience, nothing like when I was younger.I would not visit again.",1
"Went there today. 11 rides were closed, 4 of which were fast pass rides. What a waste of a lot of money.",1
You have to wait around an hour for an activity less than 5 minutes long and the prices for food are crazy.,1
"Just back from 5 days at Eurodisney, firstly I can tell you that 5 days is waaay too long but I was sucked in by their special offer of free days so we went for the 5. We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge hotel, our first room had a flooded carpet from next door's shower so we were 'upgraded' to another room (a Montana) which was exactly the same in every way apart from being in the main hotel as opposed to a separate block. The decor of the rooms is very tired, even my children (10 & 12) both commented that it was horrible. No kettle or tea & coffee making facilities in the the room. The towels provided for the shower were literally as small as hand towels.Being Easter hols I had hoped that more of the rides would have been open but a huge number were closed for refurbishment which was yet another disappointment. Many of the shows we did go to featured an awful lot of filler and about 2 minutes of any interest.What really left a bad taste in my mouth was the ridiculous cost of the restaurants, for the three of us to have anything other than a burger hotdog cheap pizza would have left me at least    100 lighter per meal. One of the restaurants on site was charging    31 for a BURGER! At another I was charged    32 for three rolls and 3 cans of drink. They have a captive audience and by crikey they make the most of it.The cheaper option food that we did have was very ordinary, I dodon't think we have eaten so much junk food in 5 days as we did last week.Overall it was a truly disappointing experience and not one I plan to ever repeat.",1
"Feel so let down with this place,the Disneyland train was fantastic until you get past the station,bad signage, terrible staff who just did not want to be there ,it was rainning and rides were not working could not find a map of place, over priced fun park. Disney characters only 2 seen under a cabana having photos with visitors queuing up in the rain. Dont waste your money. Walt Disney would be horrified, not enough eating places for the amount of people or rest rooms. Seems they are building something but who knows what. No atmosphere of fun and fantasy. ",2
"I went to HK Disneyland on 5 April which happens to be Qing Ming festival and did not expect the massive crowds on that day. Queues for rides and F&B outlets were very long and we did not have a great experience especially with a young kid. For the amount spent on the tickets, it's really a waste of money as we only sat on a few rides. I'm wondering if the park has any cap on the number of guests in the park as we had a hard time finding seats around. I booked my tickets via the Disneyland Hotel online but there was no info or confirmation given to me whether my park tickets are booked. In the end, I was unable to enter and had to buy tickets on the spot. Luckily, one of the cast members, Carmen, helped us to resolve the issue and let us access without queuing up again. Also the balloons there are overrpriced   HK150 for a helium balloon.",2
"Didn   t feel the Disney spirit in this place. There were few Disney characters around, but one must wait in long lineup to shake hand with them. We stayed for only couple hours and left.",2
"Very very small, disappointing all along the line... the park is too small, without big attractions. In 3 hours you will have seen everything. There was construction with a lot of noise during our visit. It was ridiculous to visit the enchanted forest when you heard a jackhammer!! The maneges are limited. The prices are high for the quality of the park. It is better to keep your money and invest it in another activity ",2
"As my husband and I had a free day before we flew back home , decided to visit here, being that as we are over the age of 64 we got entry of just under   10 each depending on the currency rate. This park does not open until 10.30am, but we arrived earlier as we decided to buy our ticket on the gate rather than do this by phone. Surprisingly enough it was a very easy and quick process, just had to show our passportsWe got on the metro from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay station, crossed the platform to catch the Disneyland train which was only one stop.Seeing that this was a Monday the amount of people waiting for the park to open was massive, bug bear is that nearly everyone is on their phones and then you have to put up with them doing a 101 selfies. (please if you love yourself that much just get a mirror). Anyway the announcement was NOT TO RUN when they opened the gates, BUT WHAT did they all do RUN, no manners at all, push and shoved.This park is not a patch on the original Disney in Florida. There are very few rides and you can get round this park so quick. This is certainly not worth the   60 plus for adults .The atmosphere is certainly not here either, maybe because it was not very warm.",2
Overcrowded with Chinese tourist who likes to take photos of cute young children without permission. The rides are fun but taking too long to queue. Food offering is good.,2
"One of the group had been to Disneyland in Japan and wanted to go to this one.I had been told was the staff are very friendly, welcoming and peppy plus the mascots milling about and very fun. Don   t know if upwelling went on a bad day or something but it was not a great experience. With the exception of two staff none of them smiled or made you feel welcome. As to for the mascots, finally saw them at the end of our day and only in the    town    part.Costumes were ruined by staff wearing black running shoes. OK they are on their feet and need to be comfortable but it was seriously jarring. Staff get a 2 10.Things like the recycling bin being loaded and taken away to be emptied but not one put in to replace. Tables not being cleared.Two of the restaurants were shut, a number of the rides were closed, the castle was shut.At HK$620 it was not worth the money. I was told Disneyland HK was loosing money and I am not surprised.We went on a number of rides and they all had positives. Loved the Ironman ride, Starwars and the roller coaster in the Gulch.",2
"So much of the park is closed!! Very disappointing   only a few rides In the park. I do know there is an expansion planned, but so much was closed now, I dodon't know how they can afford to expand! I knew it was a small park before we went, but it is lacking the 'Disney' in every aspect... other than the cost! It is really easy to get to on the MTR and good for about 3hrs of entertainment If you are looking for something different to do while visiting HK.",2
I love Disneyland but I woulddon't recommend Hongkong Disneyland.The reasons are:1. The staffs in Hongkong Disneyland not good like Disneyland or disneysea tokyo. They're very rude n not polite. Difficult to speak in English.2. Better I went to Dufan Jakarta than Disneyland Hongkong. I heard staff shouting the people who lining the attraction.3. No smile from the Disneyland Hongkong staff.,2
"If you going for the Disneyland adventure this is not the place. The price to enter is ridiculously high and don   t bother with the skip line thing coz it   s just not worth it, if you get there early enough you will get to go on all the rides before lunch and then you have been on them all. The famous Disney castle was undergoing a renovation that was not indicated on their website or at the gate. From the drinks to food and all those stupid little shops everything is way overpriced. The photo below was taken at 11:00. ",2
" Too experience to visit ,for over $600 Hk , every things so crazy , waiting time for any ride well over one hours ! washroom is closed to one and half hours wait ,poor ladies 1,the foods is so pricey ever Micky would not buy it ,people ,people ,people ! it is a small kingdom with no local want to come ,no wonder they lost money every year ,better off save time and moneys do some things else ,you will thank me for it !",2
they dodon't have as many rides as other Disneys.  Easy to get to.  Charge a fortune for bag storage but there are cheaper lockers if your bag is not big. Castle is still being built so not great yet.,2
Our two day visit to Disneyland was a bitter disappointment. The park was so busy you could not move around freely. The average wait time for each ride was 60 minutes. There is no option of a fast pass as is the norm in many other theme parks around the world. We did not see the Disney Princesses for a photo opportunity (which was the only reason my youngest two wanted to go to Disneyland) and all the other photo opportunities were full before we even arrived at the destination. The train around the park only went one way and did not return to its point of departure. The lines for coffee and food resulted in is leaving the park earlier than we anticipated because the wait was too long. A very disappointing experience to say the least and we will not be back! Please do not visit during the Christmas New Year season!,2
"When we arrived there the castle was closed and some other rides were not operating, but still had to pay full price. We ate a meal there and it was absolutely tasteless, in fact the worst meal i have had for years.We ordered Shabu Shabu from the Japanese outlet. I wanted to order fish & chips from somewhere near the goldmine but the restaurant was closed.Corn on the cob about US$6, ice cream terribly expensive. My wife enjoyed visiting Disneyland, seeing a couple of parades, a couple of shows and many photos but it would have been more enjoyable if we had children. BUT i am sure it would have cost a lot more because they would be wanting ice cream, toys, pop corn drinks etc and i would not have been prepared to pay these ridiculous prices.",2
"Hong Kong Disneyland is just too small with limited rides compared to parks in California, Tokyo or Paris. A little disappointing but the kids (10 and 13) enjoyed it all the same   it   s Disney after all!! A good place to spend the afternoon if you have time to spare, otherwise I would give it a miss.",2
Was quite disappointed as the castle was under renovation hence no fireworks. The characters roaming around the park was limited. The street march ended very fast.,2
"Yikes, the worst thing about HK Disneyland is the never ending same same music, over and over again, the same tunes. Omg I could pull my hair out, I would seriously go bonkers if I had to work there. When my kids were small, we went many times and I have to say, they absolutely loved it every time. We even discovered that the best time to go is in the pouring rain as no one else is there and there are no queues! If it suddenly brightens up it will be about 2 hours before the crowds return, that, my friends, is a very good tip. Nowadays we never go and stuff like that I avoid like the plague but if you've got young kids then you just have to take them, they will love it. Remember tho, it's crowded as all hell, expensive, you cadon't take your own food so you are forced to eat at the restaurants and even buy water and the queues are long. I used to smuggle in sandwiches under a dark piece of cloth at the bottom of my bag, you can get stuff in if you hide it well. Enjoy x",2
The Disneyland here is way too commercialized   too many stores than rides compared to the ones in US!My brother did not enjoy it since the ultimate night show was cancelled & that was not announced in their website!It was a big disappointment for my supposed to be treat!,2
"When it comes to Disney, you expect wonderful things, but we were very disappointed with our overall experience here on our recent visit. The park is very small and doesdon't have the magical vibe that Anaheim Disneyland exhibits. The majority of staff that we encountered had the personalities of bricks and showed no happiness or excitement. Food options were very average and opportunities for photos with characters were limited. With the park closing at approx 8:45pm on the day we visited, photos with Mickey and Minnie were closed off at 4pm, causing much disappointment from numerous visitors. The general upkeep of the park also seemed quite poor, with overgrown gardens and dirty grounds in some areas. While there was the advantage of much shorter queues for rides, this Disneyland just feels like another average theme park and doesdon't even come close to comparing with the original in Anaheim. I woulddon't recommend visiting this theme park. ",2
"When we planned our trip to Hong Kong we diddon't realise that we would be there for the Mid Autumn Festival. When we went to Disneyland on the Sunday before the Festival we diddon't realise that the line to get into the park would be over an hour long at 10am. The heat was oppressive and there was far too little shade and water dispensers available. After waiting, waiting and waiting we gave up by 3pm (after only getting in at 11am!) and left.The park is very small compared to other Disneyland's but the crowds at the bag check at the entrance were like I have never, ever seen before. Crazy!",2
"Only go here if you have never been to a Disneyland before, or you are one of those people who are crazy for Disney. It   s small. Really small. You can do the whole park in a half day. Don   t go on a Chinese Holiday or it will be flooded with Mainland Chinese tourists. Pretty much the same as every other Disneyland just 10% of the size. Take advantage of the fast pass system. If your ticket is crumpled or broken and the machine won   t accept it, there is a small inconspicuous button on the back of the fastpass machine that will print a fast pass ticket for you. Unscrupulous visitors can press it repeatedly to get multiple rides without waiting in line. Visit the rides that don   t have fast pass first or last thing. Stay late for the fireworks over the castle.",2
"Second time here in 11 years and my first visit was better. Trying to celebrate our honeymoon in 1 of 3 Disneylands. They dodon't have a good pin selection here  just stickers? Not impressed since we traditionally get pins from Disney world every time we go. Customer service is not Disney level. People avoided eye contact, only approached us at the dining cafe when we we're signaling for help, and some cast members were on their cell phones! We we're trying to buy storm trooper magnets and we had to wait for someone to look up from their phone and ring us up. The roller coasters are fun and there were no lines it being a Wednesday. Super clean bathrooms and park. Toy story land is small but the rides are good for kids. They decorated for Halloween so it was enjoyable to see. Due the damages from the typhoon, the jungle cruise was closed  no biggie but I probably wodon't want to come back specifically for that ride. Thank goodness for the good company I was with. He was able to point out the fun Disney decor. Which is what I love about Disney parks.",2
"The services compare with the opening period is totally different.1  Guide and map is not easy for traveller organize they own plan as the date before. It   s must be spend more time for the whole trip. 2  The show (Lion king my favorites show) not such carrying the same feelings. Less actress and not monumental anymore.3  The souvenirs quality honestly really    China   , such like the things you can find in Mongkok market.Hope its will help you somehow. Thank you.",2
"What can I say, having been to the USA and to Disney Paris, this one is the worst one so far. Expensive to enter, expensive to buy water and food.Gifts were over priced too.Totally disappointed that there were no big rides, everything seemed geared towards young children, nothing for us big kids.Dodon't waste your money, save up and go to the USA, the best Disney by far.",2
"We found this the worst Disney Park around the world. It's far too small, not at all immersive in some areas. The castle was very small too, it just diddon't have the magic. On a bright note, it's easy to get too for a quick few hours.",2
"Over priced, overly busy, too few attractions, expensive food and drinks and just generally not worth the effort and attendance compared to alternative parks in Hong Kong!!",2
"Took my 12 year old, she was really excited as we   d nevre been to a Disney land before. We were expecting to see the characters walking around for photos, greetings etc but there wasn   t any that we saw. You could queue up to meet them privately if you wanted. Think 12 was just too old. There were a few bigger rides that we went on that were very good,but not many. Long queues for everything and mostly family rides that very little kids could go on so not very thrilling. Very expensive day out. Took an hour to get there, went on 4 rides in 31 2 hours and left. Wouldn   t go back.",2
Small and dated. Poor facilities. Young children will enjoy the place. The food is very expensive...,2
"Definitely not the best Disneyland Park. Disappointed with the size of the castle as well as with most attractions (definitely for very young children). Not much of a Disney magic in the parc, it doesn   t feel like Disney at all.",2
Attraction are not a lot.   Klook is a cheapest way to buy a ticket but recommend to not buy a value meal and reason is in a photo i share.  About popcorn is not good cooked.,2
"After buying tickets via trip advisor to find that we had to go on a defined day, we went on the day when there was a typhoon warning so the vast majority of the attractions were not open   in fact all of the outside attractions!! We had a lovely very day but sooo disappointed that the sun was out but so few rides were available",2
"Have been to other Disneyland and sea, this is definitely one of the worst that we have encountered. Yes, some of the staff is friendly and helpful. Well, we did met a quite a handful staff with typical arrogant attitude that we faced in explorer hotel. Not sure if the staff was train to put on such arrogant attitude or what, if this is the case, then good job Disneyland HongKong, you have pissed off and turned off 1 of the many tourist.Will never ever visit this horrible place again.",2
"So many things were missing from this park. The castle is so small it is embarrassing and I did not find the American experience translated well. Food prices are obscene   $5 for a bottle of water   so bring your own water if nothing else. There are water fountains but the water is burning hot   really   and I was hesitant to drink it. Mystic Point was a great addition to the park as was Hyperspace Mountain. Strange hours   opening at 10 and closing at 9pm. Also, the train stopped at 6pm which was super disappointing! Why?? Really overall it seemed like a money grab and while the day was enjoyable, as someone in our party (who is a HUGE Disney fan) commented, the place  Is missing the magic . And I agree. Not a bad amusement park   the rides were fun   but the prices... .OUCH! Easy to get to though and the train there is fantastic. Also, a very nice train station at the park so that I highly recommend.",2
"Had a nightmare experience when the online booking system issued tickets for the park which my bank had rejected but this wasn   t picked up until at the park gate which caused Disneyland Park for several security people to pay a visit at the gate, it was resolved 10 minutes later but not the best Disney welcome !!Generally the park is pretty good but very busy, we stayed at the hotel so had some advanced passes which helped and it was raining on the day. ",2
"Although I read the reviews prior to going, I still wasdon't expecting the park to be that small. The first disappointment was the 'fake' train station building. It looked like a backdrop from a cheap play made out of canvas. Main Street was less than 5th of the length than it's counterparts, and castle (although surrounding by hoarding), looked no higher than your tallest basketball player! Many of the food establishments were closed, although what i eat eat was very good. Been to many Disney Parks, and this was by far the worst...really not worth they money they're asking for.",2
Not value for money.. Overated and very small Disneyland and its a tourist trap to go here. Better to visit Ocean Park instead...,2
We are from the Gold Coast so spoilt with amazing theme parks but had to tick off Disneyland while in Hong Kong. The place is very well done but hardly any rides and a very small park. The rides they did have we're more geared up for toddlers which is Disneys target market.If you have teenagers I woulddon't suggest it. My kids were very disappointed.,2
"There were no fireworks because the castle was undergoing transformation : ( Since it was already a small version, the transformation of some areas made it much smaller : (",2
"My wife and I are Disney fans. We aren   t particularly fanatical but we have enjoyed our visits to Tokyo Disneyland and are the type to go before opening and stay till closing time. Since we were coming to HK, we couldn   t pass up the opportunity to visit HK Disneyland as I had never been before.Based on reviews online, I had already tempered expectations but even then, I was disappointed when we got there. The good thing was that the queue to get into the park and the rides was so short (we went on a weekday). I enjoyed the trackless mystic manor ride. The effects and the ride experience is one of a kind and highly recommended. Grizzly mine cart was fun too with 2 unexpected twists, no spoilers here.That   s about all the good I can really say, now the parts that disappointed:I don   t see what   s the point of letting guests in 15 minutes early to the Main Street before they open up the park proper. After they finally opened the park, I didn   t expect other parts of the park ( toy story, etc) to open at 11. They also closed earlier at 730pm. The place was already so small, surely they could organise it such that all parts of the park could open and close simultaneously.As we walked around the park, many snack stands were still closed and many cafes were closed for the day. It takes away from the festivity of the place.We were the first to sit Mystic Manor and we were excited but when we got to the ride, we found the girls standing around chatting and they looked surprised to see us. They then hurriedly rushed off to prep and asked us to wait 5 minutes. It felt like they lacked a lot of professionalism. The staff were also not enthusiastic and acted like they were there because it was their job and not because they had a love of Disney. They could fake it even if they didn   t but they didn   t bother and most looked very blas  .It did not feel magical at all. The food was also very mediocre. The crowd in general was a lot ruder than the crowd at Tokyo Disneyland. I had multiple groups of people cut in front of me while it was obvious I was waiting to take a picture of my wife and they saw me. People yelling across the street for each other. Some people tried to pick the best seats for the rides so service staff had to tell them to move down the line and they looked displeased they were told to do so.The stuff in the shops felt a little    recycled   . We saw goods from Paris Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland there. Felt almost like they were given the leftovers from other Disneyland resorts. Albert the monkey at Mystic Manor is a character unique to HK Disneyland but they were sold out for some of his goods and the sales lady said they weren   t sure if they were going to continue making it again. We went at 10, left by 430pm and don   t ever plan on going back. I expected much more and had hoped for a decent experience but I feel like HK Disneyland didn   t put in enough effort to make the place as magical as it should be, especially moreso for the ticket price they are charging. It felt like this resort is just riding off the popularity of the Disney name but it did not do it justice. If you really want to go, look for discount tickets, don   t pay full price. Go with kids since the queue is so short, they can ride the rides repeatedly and you don   t have to rush there in the morning. Also, unlike Tokyo Disneyland, there   s a proper line to do the character meet and greets so you will assured of a picture as long as you brave the long queues. It gets very hot during the summer so be sure to lather on sunscreen and bring a hat umbrella. There is barely any shade there. Use the lockers to stash your stuff, you can reopen them anytime so it is worth the money to get one. Nothing is cheap in Disneyland, the only magic I felt was how quickly your money goes while you are there.I really had hoped for more from Hong Kong Disneyland but I think I won   t ever return unless they do a major revamp, for both the park itself and its staff.",2
A good effort but doesn   t really get close to the real deal. We visited out of curiosity but were a bit disappointed. Not really that entertaining for couples or families alike if you have experienced the real USA version.,2
"Hong Kong Disneyland has the potential to be a really fun place, but it seems management is more concerned about cost cutting than guest experience. The park hours of operation are very short compared to Disney in USA. When they open the park at 10am, they don   t open the ENTIRE park. They open in sections which makes no sense to me. There are many outlets that have limited hours which makes it hard to even find a place to buy water.Come on HK Disney   focus on the experience of the guests. Don   t be so cheap. There is still some Disney magic here, but it could be so much better if management would focus more on the experience. Perhaps they should take their own family to experience it from the guest perspective and then they would realise how it is.",2
"Visited on a weekday in April 2018. Rides have long lines and offer VERY short ride. Some as little as 30 seconds before it stops, but generally 1min. Food okay. Bathrooms okay. The daily closing ceremonies are a waste of time. Love the train to from the park, but very expensive (compared to the other lines). I guess you could take into account that you dodon't have to pay for parking.",2
I   d been to USA Disneyland so knew this would be much smaller and it is. Extremely long (45  min) wait for 3 min ride did not impress us. Add to this the air pollution on the day we went was classed as    extreme    3 times that in Beijing which we only found out when we got home. Wondered why Disneyland wouldn   t close in days like this? Don   t buy food from here unless you have to   very expensive and poor quality fast food. Parade was the highlight.,2
"I have been to California, Florida and Tokyo Disneyland, I got the most unpleasant memories in HK Disneyland, first at all, many rides were in maintenance, for instance the princess castle and Winnie the Pooh were down, that   s not worse to pay full price with major activities down. Secondly, not so clean in HK Disneyland, you can see beverage cans everywhere. Thirdly, NO FIREWORKS.",2
"Yup. Not the happiest place. It's just too crowded that it's hard to approximate even a tinge of happiness   well maybe just for the adults. But I used to love the shiny and bright atmosphere of the original Disneyland in Orange County which one does not find here. Service is non existent, the toilets stink and the food choices are just awful. Yikes lemme outta here!",2
"We visited Disneyland as overall we were not impressed. We have been to most of them all over the world and this was the most disappointing. Lots of the Park is closed off. The castle is tiny. There were only 4 good rides for adults (hyperspace mountain, iron man,mystic manor and runaway train) lots of the children   s rides were closed.Most of the restaurants were closed so we struggled to find somewhere to eat. The snacks were limited.The Disney site told us only about rides  restaurants being refurbished. Not all of the ones they just done open! They didn   t even have the park hours on the website.I wouldn   t bother visiting..... it   s a Disney let down",2
"If you   ve been to the    better    Disneylands in Florida and Tokyo, give this a miss. Be assured that you will be disappointed. It is small, and on top of that, a bulk of it is under renovation.  Not worth a visit.",2
The Disneyland park is currently undergoing some renovation. Can be quite dusty n noisy. There were many groups from schools n it was so crowded wherever we went. Especially during meal times. No seats and we had to queue for around 45mins for food!No more fireworks since January. Ticket price should be cheaper in view of the fireworks cancellation since it's the highlight of the visit.My son's favourite antique car ride was no longer available... The HK Disneyland is no longer the place that we will want to visit again.,2
"If you have kids, awesome. Then it   s a great park to to go. Not so big thou. But if you   re older then 10 12. Don   t go here...",2
"Having visited other Disneyland in Japan and US, i have to say the Hong Kong Disneyland is really really small. Fireworks at the end of the day was lackluster as well and it was alittle disappointing. You could probably go once but that   s just about it. ",2
"We were advised to go on a weekday and we did to avoid the crowds.  Dodon't bother, it was manic !  The worst part was the queuing    it took us 90mins from when we got off the train to actually entering the park !...More",2
"As mentioned in another review here, Hong Kong Disneyland is very overrated and Universal Studios at Singapore is far far better. I was expecting a totally different and good experience considering how famous disneyland is all over the world. However, all I got is lots and lots of over expensive shops and food joints. After being to Universal and Ferrari world, Disneyland is a total disappointment. The much hyped fireworks are really bad. Good rides are very few and its more of a shopping complex. Spend an extra day at Ocean Park and totally skip Disney land.",2
"Save your money n just go to OceanPark. The HK Disney experience is terrible. Over priced, under sized. Not rewarding like Calif or FL. Save your money n go to the states. Attendance is down. Walt would be sad.",2
"The name disneyland just makes you want to think it will be a magical wonderland, although designed really well i prefer Universal studio in Singapore over this and regret not going Ocean park which looked like we would had more fun. Food and beverage was limited, long queues to take photos with the main characters, kept on changing them without any notice, limited rides, mainly for kids so Disney saying for all ages is just not correct. Hoping Paris and Florida experience will be better if i ever go. Only good thing was at the end Fireworks over sleeping beauty's castle.otherwise place is really overrated!!",2
Diddon't rate this park.we were advised the first thing to do would be to take the train around the park to find out where everything was.. this was a waste of time as the trees and bushes were so high you could hardly see any of the park. Took us all of 2hours to walk around the whole site.we went with a trip and were being picked up after 8pm by 3pm we had seen the whole thing so left and got train back to hotel. Really disappointed in the whole experience.,2
"I have been to 4 Disneyland Parks over the years   Disneyland Paris, Disneyland Anaheim, Tokyo Disneyland and Sea, and part of the    magical feeling    is being surrounded by their super friendly staff. HongKong Disneyland however, was entirely the opposite. I really didn   t expect majority of their staff to be grumpy, snobbish, super rude even. Majority don   t smile, they don   t greet, they are not willing to help you out even when asking for a simple direction, they shout, my 4 year old son even got scolded in front of me since he was holding on to one of the queue ropes, the worst part?  I was carrying my son because he got tired while waiting for the queue at the ironman ride, this young staff shouted at me and asked me to put him down! I wanted to argue but I don   t want to ruin our mood so we just complied. In the royal banquet restaurant, the staff are also hot tempered. We hardly understand their english, so we politely requested to repeat what they are saying, but as expected, the staff got pissed and shouted again.When asking for direction, they seemed to be not in the mood to assist as well.In the merchandise stores, don   t expect them to help you when you are buying a US$60 toy and (after paying) you want to try if the battery operated toy is working. I have been told that    it should work or just bring it back it if doesn   t   . The positive side: The park is clean, and there   s always an english translation in almost all the rides. Also, since we went there on a weekday (Monday & Tuesday, which I think is the best time to visit), there was hardly a queue on majority of the rides and attraction . The longest queue is around 20 minutes, while majority is 5 10 minutes thereabouts.I am not sure if our experience with their staff is culture related, but majority of the staff at Disney Hollywood Hotel, including the shuttle bus drivers were likewise rude. I will be sharing our experience at this hotel in a separate review.All in all, if you are used to the friendly ambiance in most Disneyland Resorts, you basically have to lower down your expectations when visiting Hongkong Disneyland. Disney Management should seriously look into this. I am not sure if the staff are compensated well, but they should be consistently reminded to be customer service oriented, because they definitely seem to be the most unhappiest, and unfriendliest staff.",2
We have been to all the Disney parks in the world and Hong Kong was the list in the list and turned out to be absolute disappointment. My daughter wanted to see all the princess and we diddon't see any apart from Sofia the first and that too straight from the disney film. Castle was very small compared to other Disneyland or even one in Shanghai. All in all it was just an disappointment.,2
"The ticket price of 580 odd dollars is not worth the visit here. It is generally very crowded, one has to wait in line for hours for every ride, which means one cannot do more than 4 5 rides in a day. The food and refreshments here are very expensive too, so you end up shelling out a lot of money.On hot and sunny days, it becomes very difficult to move around.All in all, we didnt find the visit worth the money at all.",2
"The crowd in Hong Kong in general is rude and impolite and will not think twice before pushing and shoving their way through. And this trait of those visiting Disneyland gets heightened even more. The rides have a minimum waiting time of 1 hour. Often it seems people dodon't even know why they were standing in a particular line. Just not worth the experience. If you just cadon't miss this, then at least go after 3 pm. Most rides are open till 8 and park is open till 10:30. Disappointing and just not worth it. ",2
"If you every been to or intend to visit Japan Disney, I say can give this a miss! Not only the services are bad, the food, the rides and even the crowd here are terrible. I have nothing against China Tourists, but it looks like they behave extremely badly in theme parks, especially when the staff dodon't give a s* too. I was pushed, queue cut, spitted beside and even saw some smoking in toilet. People aside, only kids may not noticed the rides are not as good, it seems small and does not have the  magical feel .However, I find the meal at Enchanted Garden Resturant (we stayed here) though expensive but was enjoyable.",2
"All the old rides nothing new and a charge very high. Food is very bad, staff working there are very rude and very bad behavior they think they are the boss all the rides are normal and lot of people.",2
"This is one small crowded Disneyland and to be honest, the tourists that frequent this place aredon't the most considerate. Definitely my least favourite Disneyland.",2
"Was quite disappointed with the park and should have done some research. We were mostly disappointed about the small size of the park and lack of rides compared to its North American and even EuroDisney counterparts. It's quite far from HK but easy to get to by MTR although you will need to transfer a couple of time. It doesdon't need more than 1 day to get through it. We bought 2 day tickets but actually did not regret it as the heat in August is oppressive and we could only stay for a few hours at a time. Favourite rides were the Grizzly Gulch train and Mystic Manor (as it was air conditioned). Hyperspace mountain was OK   Star Wars themed now but pretty tame coaster compared to the updated Space Mountains in other parks. Meet and greet with the Star Wars characters was also a highlight though. On the 2nd day, it rained a little and all the outdoor rides closed. Also all the food vendors shut down as well. Cadon't imagine what we would have done if we bought the food voucher. If you've been to other Disney parks, prepare to be disappointed. If this is your first time to Disney, you get a taste of what the original is like so you will likely have much more fun. ",2
"This was my first visit to ANY Disneyland. We arrived at 10am on a Thursday morning. I expected to see larger than life characters casually walking around. I thought I'd see a HUGE Disney castle and watch my kids faces explode with excitement. I thought I'd find some healthy food options.....Alas, none of those thugs happened for us. I thought the staff would be super happy and friendly (like the Disney adverts!) but only the cleaners were. The retail staff were totally vacant!I appreciated the  fast pass  system, but wish that had been extended to other rides so our under 5yr olds diddon't have to queue 30mins for a 2min ride on a teacup. The best time of day for us was the last 30mins before the park closed whilst everyone was waiting for the parade and the queues cleared. Bliss. I cadon't say I'll go back. Maybe staying in a hotel on site it would be better.I just left thinking we should have saved the first Disneyland for a trip to the USA....",2
"It's not the most extensive Disneyland you'll ever go to but it's ok. If you're into thrilling rides, go to Ocean Park. But it's still good for younger kids of course.",2
"Disneyland is a fantasy for everyone, guess everybody read and watch about the stories and surely would like to see it in person. That's why everybody is excited about Disneyland. Especially those ones in Western World. However, the one in Hong Kong was too small to put everything together. Therefore they can only selected some themes they thought can attract more visitors. Unfortunately they failed. Once can compare with those one in France or US, You will found the one in Hong Kong is waste of time to visit, you will encounter only queuing but without fun. Further, you will be pushed to dine within the site and found they are robbing you. But in a while if you have nothing to do and have spare money in your pocket then you can tell your friends that you have been one more Disneyland.",2
"Had to wait on average 30mins for a ride.  Rides were on average 45 secs long.   If you love waiting in the stinking hot humid weather then this is the place for you.   For me, never again.  Kids were not overly impressed either.",2
Honestly maybe i'm just not a Disney fan. The small world ride low key creeped me out. The food was a tad bit over priced and tasted like microwave food.,2
"Disney is synonymous of magic. I am not particular fond of theme parks or Disneyland, after taken my kids their, now adults, too many times. But I appreciate what the inheritors of Walt Disney vision have been able to achieve. No one can deny the global significance of Disney as a cultural symbol of American talent, creativity and command of the entertainment industry. As expected they have tried to translate that experience into a more local and regional  cultural dialect . That is why we have Disney parks in France, Tokyo, Hong Kong and so on. In the end when you visit those Disney parks in foreign lands you have a kind of split personality experience. You do not really know where you are and what you are watching. If you are from the USA or from a Western country, and traveling with your family, I strongly advise you to avoid Hong Kong Disneyland. Immerse your self in providing them with a real experience of a place that most probably they will not be visiting again soon. Taking them to Disney will just make them yearn for going back home and reduce their interest in experiencing the certainly much more confusing cultural landscape of this strange lands. Going to Disneyland is quick solution to keep the kids happy. But dodon't be fooled. It will replace the magic of discovery for the conventional and convenient magic they are used to. The problem in the end is that Disneyland is not Disney and its not China.",2
"In Hong Kong the whole park revolves around disney merchandising.You'll find an endless serie of similar shops selling all sort of toys and (mostly useless) gimmicks.The rollercoasters seem to target far younger crowds than else in the world, or better, they are family focused, with exhausted adults wearing disney outfits enduring infinite lines with children on tail. Even if I have nothing against it, I was expecting some more excitement for millennials and grown up kids, like you can find in Tokyo for example.Surely a missed opportunity.",2
This is surely an over hyped place. The area is very small if you compare with other places. Rides are very few (especially for those who are  12 years) and place is more of a selling Disney merchandise than a theme park. Strictly for kids who are small and are still fascinated by watching cartoon characters. ,2
"For the Name Disneyland, this place falls short on expectations. Rides like Winnie the Poo was a disappointment. Except for a few ones like the Iron Man, the 3D Show & the Indoor roller coaster, rest of which were pretty much ordinary. Overpriced food and rude agents keeps them going. No sign of disneyland's experience...Felt Sad..",2
Hk Disneyland nothing can compare to the rest of Disneyland around the world ! I woulddon't take my kids there again ! Just too small boring !,2
Will not be going back. Very expensive and you queue for an hour for a 2 minute ride. The rides are great once you get on but the queues are just too long.,2
Expensive tickets and expensive food inside premises.  Few choices of rides. Long queues (each lasted more than an hour). Too crowded!,2
"This was my second Disney visit the first one was Tokyo. Well, what can I say? I diddon't really enjoy this as much as the Tokyo one. This was smaller. And the manners of the locals were so appalling that I would never come back again. Some kids were peeing in the middle of the square.. It's like the culture of the land is that you're allowed to be rude, disgusting and the road is your personal toilet. Would not come again..",2
"Pretty disappointed. There isdon't much to do here other than walk around the park. The 4d movie was good. There was a main stage play that everyone waited hours in line for but we found out after we waited for hours that it wasdon't in English (unlike everything else). There was one ride, it was like a western gold rush ride and it was pretty good! We only saw one Disney princess very late in the day as we were leaving. It was always a dream to go to Disneyland but I was sadly so disappointed.",2
Disneyland HKG   been here several times over the years and we were back again today   the rides are still good and especially the updated ones BUT the cast look miserable and it has a huge impact on the whole experience. The staff need to know 'smiling' is the most important part of their job!!,2
It's always packed here with long lines for everything   especially the rides. The rides are all very short and not very thrilling   I know Disney is meant to be for all ages but the rides feel like they are made exclusively for kids under 10. Add that with the crowds and I'd rather wait the several years it'll take me to go to the real DisneyWorld.,2
"If you're into standing in long lines to get your picture taken with Disney characters, then this is a place for you! The lineups are long for the rides, which pale in comparison to California Disneyland. If you want great rides, I'd suggest going to Ocean Park, instead of HK Disneyland. If you want a shirt that says  I went to HK Disneyland , then this is your place.",2
"They moan and groan every year and seem to constantly lose money. Yet their key attractions are closed for upkeep, it seems all the time. Food outlets are disgusting unhealthy rubbish fast greasy food. Full of junk shops and baby rides. When comparing this miserable place to Ocean Park its absolutely  no contest . Someone needs to be fired from management (n oxymoron in this case). Best skip it is my advice.",2
"A pretty small Disneyland theme park when compared to the rest around the world. The rides and facilities were not bad despite being on a smaller scale. The younger staff were full of energy and passion, which you could associate with in a Disney park. However, the good things stop there. There were quite a number of issues which could inconvenience your experiences at the park:1. Service from the older staff in supervisory positions are often a let down. They generally appeared to be cold and curt, displaying lack of professionalism and enthusiasm of those younger staff. For example, there was one supervisor (in white) at the Royal Banquet Hall who raised his voice and was pretty rude in his reply when approached. 2. Number of food options curtailed with several restaurants closed.3. A number of rides and facilities were also closed during the visits. 4. Numerous mistakes at shows such as Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. For example, singing was not in sync with the music and often out of tune. Dancing was not in sync as well. Overall, the experience at the theme park was marred by the unfortunate incidents. ",2
Its small. the rides are ok. If you been to the American one then dont even think about this. The staff is not so friendly which is a bit ironic! Nothing for vegetarians except popcorn,2
"Slightly disappointed during our visit to Disney, felt very over priced, and treated 2nd class for being a foreigner. Had fast passes, was told they diddon't work, then the next attraction accepted it, I mentioned they should tell the co workers at the Buzz Light year ride...I was approached by the manager for more detail, which was interesting...but a true apology would mean more...my intent was not to get anyone in trouble, just...well it felt discriminatory. The line up for photo with Mickey and Minnie at 2:34 minutes, well nice but not that nice.. Photo Pass cards with no photos to add to the collection, only 3 of 6 cards worked..so for a favorite stop in my passed, it's not shining like it used too...maybe Florida next time",2
"Upon entry to the Hong Kong Disneyland, there were many restrictions.  No selfie stick allowed to be used inside.  No outside food allowed, very strict checks in hand carry bags.What happened if those who are on different diet, example vegetarian, there are no pure vegetarian food available.  Will not visit again if given the choice.",2
"Having been to Disneyland in California and Disney World in Florida, this place is too small that you woulddon't need a day to see everything. The day and night parades were too short that watching them became a waste of time. Unless this is the first Disneyland that you will visit, going here would be futile.",2
"Nice buildings in disney style. Only a few disney figures. We only saw Mickey, Miney, Pluto and some of the princesses like cinderella and one other. I expected more from the Disney stories like the family duck, goody, newer stories. Toys r us etc.Some attractions where you have to wait a long time before you can go in. Everywhere you are overloaded with souvenir stores. There where too many in my opinion. No buildings from the movies.Try to go in a better season. There was a lot of maintanance.The park was clean. And ",2
expectations where high as i thought it will be better than euro disney...but by far is Hong Kong DL an smaller and really boring park. We went there on an monday out of season an i can just imagine how people will lay on eachother on an chinese new year or other peak days....my godness never again!!,2
"I was speechless when I arrived, even when I had yet to enter the disneyland. The other tourists around me were yelling at the top of their voices in the mtr, totally oblivious to the fact that it was a shared space and it was one of the most headache inducing 15 min of my life. When we queued to enter, I was shoved and nobody seemed to care that they had pushed someone. I mean.. what's the rush if everyone got a ticket. The facilities were decent and I thought they would have been good if they attracted more civilised culture to the area. Toilets were beyond gross and wet. Food was decent, but I would rather fly to Japan for their Disneyland than fight it out with this bunch here. ",2
"Well , at first we were happy when we arrive at disney station, but when we get up to the main gate, it was SO HOT! We did not prepare for the sun heat. The rides was ok , the food and drink was so pricey. I thought sleeping beauty castle was bigger and higher. Toilet smells urinate. Its better that people to go to Parus, or US disney to experience better park.",2
"As an avid Disney fan, I was very disappointed primarily by the size of this small park (compared to the US EU parks). Other than the size, same superb quality",2
"Found the place so in Disney! Give it a miss, go either to Japan Disney or Euro Disney which is amazing",2
"More like a big merchandising area with a few attractions for kids from 3 to 7 years. No real roller coaster, actually no attraction for people older than 12 at all. But my boys, 2 and 4, had fun. Queuing was OK, because it was off season. The rides mostly took les than 2 minutes, the time in between the rides was much longer... It wasdon't painful, but if you expect a similar experience to european or US theme parks, then it is disappointing.",2
"Having visited Disneyland Florida many years ago I was expecting a similair experience.Unfortunately Disneyland Hong Kong felt dated, basic & underwhelming.The characters were very professional and my 6 yr old daughter was pleased.This is a place for children under 10 yrs old offering little for teenagers or adults to enjoy.80 percent of the food halls were closed on our visit and the two we ate in were a nightmare. Aweful food, truly terrible, expensive and unclean.",2
"The day we visited was EXTREMELY hot, and the park diddon't seem prepared for the heat. Some ride lines had fans but not enough. As English speakers, we found no problems at all throughout the day with language. well over half the restaurants were closed and only ONE had a western food option, defiantly do not go to Disneyland for the food!Mystic manor was our favorite ride, and it's a Hong Kong exclusive!",2
"Took my kids there, long lines and boring rides, and they dodon't even have the haunted house....I wodon't go there again.",2
"IMO very badBeen to japan one and hk seems to be very pale in comparisionKids always enjoy the parade but the parade at 3pm only feature1   mickey2   minnie3   goofyWhilst the park at tokyo feature the entire cast of the parksAlso due to low season, a lot of eateries not openWeather is hot to enjoy the ridesRecommend go in cooling season",2
"Visited with 2 young children. Train to Disneyland is nice. Visited on wkday and not much crowd, short waiting time. Some pushcarts and a few eating places not operating. No selfie stick is allow. The food are expensive. 99% of the staff( fr restaurant or shops or rides assiatance) we came by are unfriendly, no smile and rude. The 1st rude staff is at the self  help ticketing station who keep saying 'no no no no' while walking towards us. These staff really spoil our day. Put on mozzie patch or repellent. Me and my hubby got biten all over the legs which the red spots last many days.Most of the rides are for young children, not much for adult. 2 days visit is good if u want a more relax trip especially with children. We spent 3 4 of the day during the 1st day and half a day on 2nd day for night view. Our verdict: japan disneyland is so much better and fun. Will not revisit in the next few yrs.",2
HKG Disneyland was an expensive disappointment. Time and money better spent !  Go to Ocean Park.  Especially if your hotel is on the Island side.,2
"It was my first visit to Disneyland so we do not know what to expect. went with extended family with 3 toddler. did not expect Hong Kong Disneyland to be influx with mainland China customer which cut queue, pushing from behind all the while in Disneyland. working staff is way too little, did not have anyone to control the crowds and their behaviour. it was just a very bad experience at Disneyland. Food was terrible yet at exorbitant price. definitely will not recommend any tourist to visit. it will be a whole day wasted.",2
The price to get in here was pretty steep for what you get for it. The Gulch mine cart ride was well worth it and the boat trip around the island at adventure land (I think) was entertaining. The Star Wars ride was thrilling through pitch darkness but the wait for this ride was ridiculous and no fans or coolers to keep such a large number of people cool in high heat and humidity while they wait. We just waited for long periods of time in line after line for short rides. There weredon't too many spots to sit down to rest and you could only buy the designated branded items on sale at their high prices for food and drinks. The family were pretty frazzled by early afternoon and we pulled the pin only to have to wait in lines for the train to stand all the way back to the hotel. ,2
"yes this is the smallest of the disney parks, do you need a fully day here, well no. It was busy and hot and several rides had broken down including the rollercoaster and also the car racer in toy story land. They also closed 3 lands at 5pm for a private function, if i knew that I would not have booked as this was not on the website!",2
"Visited Hong Kong Disneyland with my husband and three children, ages 7, 5, and 2. We had a beautiful, albeit very warm, day at the park. Having been to Disney World in Orlando several times, this park was much smaller scale and was a bit underwhelming by comparison. At the outset, we were frustrated because my husband purchased tickets to the park online upon our arrival at the park, and we were told we would have to wait one hour before we could gain entry, even though he had received a confirmation of purchase. Not what we wanted to hear when we had three eager children at the gates. We were really disappointed by the lack of characters to be found around the park. Plus, we tried to visit with Mickey and Minnie, Pluto and Jessie from Toy Story, and each time we were told to come back later, as they were closing for a break. It was a little frustrating that they dodon't have replacements available. We waited in long lines  generally 30 minutes to an hour for each ride  but we were there the day after a Chinese holiday so it is possible that we encountered higher than normal crowd volumes. This meant that in the 7 hours we stayed, we only rode 7 rides, and took one breaks for a beverage and one for lunch. In addition, they shut down three sections of the park at 4:30 for special events, which undoubtedly also contributed to overcrowding of the rides. The bad news covered, Toy Story Land was very unique and creatively designed, the park was well maintained, and the smaller size of the park made it manageable to navigate in one day, but I would not make a special effort to return.",2
"Did not think it's worth the money,does not compare to other Disney parks.Very compact and would not like to be their in peak season.The staff in the main are good and polite but board stiff (sorry disney)The site and toilets are very clean ,be prepared to Que for the few rides on the parkwould I go again NO",2
"It's okay, it's small, are the rides shorter cause they feel shorter ?  I wunder if Shanghai Disney is a better day out .",2
"The park is so small, with so few people and performances that it is almost depressing. There are no new rides there either so if you are a long time Disney person you wodon't find anything new or exciting. You will be much more pleased with Shanghai Disney which is only a short two hour flight away.",2
"Part of it why I didnt enjoyed was because it was raining the day I went. And I found out they charged for the raincoat at HKD 65, and some of their rides are even closed.",2
My only comparison is the Disney land Paris which is huge comparing HK one.The most action oriented activity are the mine and the space roller coaster but they are both small and not that exceptional.Would work with the very young kids.For teens or adult it's boring...,2
I decide to go see this attraction to compare the ones in Anaheim and Florida ! Sad to say it's a total bust ! Long walk from parking to Disney Entrance gate ! Some major attraction were closed for maintenance! Long long lines to ride most rides! Food was total overcharge and plain average! Service ? Hah hah they think they doing u service by pointing out where I want go? So pity enough said about the Disney I remembered in USA ! That's a must see if u have young ones ! Really so pity! Andre,2
"It's a little difficult to describe the experience there... A lot of good things in the park, but a lot of bad things either... the staff is great and helpful... The food court is to avoid... The toilets needs to be cleaned more often, the attractions are typically Disney... Unbelievably expensive merchandise... Great fireworks at night... ",2
"Disney is a long way on the MTR but , it's still quick, when you get there the park entrance is a bit of a walk,    once there you will be in a fair size Q to get your ticket, when you get in there isdon't much to do if your comparing it with any Disney park in Florida, we stayed at the Hollywood hotel for a night, it was fine as you would expect, it's a pity the hotel isdon't closer to the park, when you get off the MTR you have to get in a Q for the bus to take you to the hotel, when you have checked in you get the bus back to the MTR station then you walk to the park entrance, once your there you can fight your way round the few attractions there are, the park when we visited seemed very overcrowded it was like sardines, too many people for the size of venue, getting back to the hotel was walk to the bus which is at the MTR Q up and get the bus to the hotel, quite a bit of faffing about for staying at a Disney hotel, they should have provided dedicated buses from the park To the hotels, Getting on the MTR for your return journey is again another Q and a wait, and it was hot, not a good combination.Iv only given this attraction a 2 but this might be because we have been to Disney in Florida and it's different.",2
"I've only ever been to Paris Disneyland before HK Disneyland and when I compare it to that, HK is pretty disappointing. The excitement starts when you get on the Disneyland train of course and when you arrive, but when I saw the size of the castle I just laughed, that set the tone for the day.I was only able to go on a few rides and they were all very tame. To me it felt like it was missing a couple of exciting adult rides. The park itself is quite small and you can get around within 4 5 hours so it seemed to be better to go later in the day so that you could stay for the late show.Souvenirs were more for kids and greatly lacking in adult gifts, like glass items or other collectibles, coulddon't even find any snowglobes.This place is an alcohol free zone also",2
"As a Disney lover, I was so disappointed with Hong Kong Disney. With its next to no rides, disinterested staff, and general lack of spark and character, there was no magic to this kingdom.",2
"It's not what you expect from Disneyland, quite small, crowded of course and little boring also for kids",2
"Sorry, but I am not a big fan. It's part of the Disney corporation which simply fleeces people and families for nothing. The rides at HK Disney are nothing special, the food is terrible and they try to sell you plastic trash at every opportunity. Avoid. If you want to go to something like this visit 'Ocean Park'   it's 100 times better, easier to get to and educational, as well as having many more rides.",2
"I remember visiting HK quite a number of years back with the school trip.This is the first Disney Land I have ever been to, most of the rides is short but fun.At the end of the day, there's a 10 15mins long of fireworks, it was spectacular and beautiful. If this is your first time visiting a Disneyland and never been to any before, you surely will be left in amaze and wow.But after been to several DL around the world, I had to say, this is one of the  smaller  version with shorter rides. It's tough call esp after you've visit several better ones around the world. But nonetheless, it's still a pleasant experience and a legit DL park compare to the rip off CN version.",2
"was there with some friends for a long weekend, only wait for attractions , waiting waiting waiting. was a nice day not a holiday, chosen by purpose, but still very disapointing",2
"We visited HK Disneyland in the month of July, I'm guessing it was school holidays in neighbouring China, so there were hoards of Chinese tourists. The queues were Long and we had to wait a minimum of 45 minutes for each ride, the queues were very badly managed by the Disneyland authorities. Some of the quiet were suffocating as there were no fans even and hardly any place to stand due to the winding queues. To add to it, the Neighbouring crowd were very noisy and had total disregard for others, and were happily cutting queues at every opportunity without any guilt or consideration for young kids who were standing on the line.We managed only a few rides for our 7 year old Daughter due to the Long queues, however the evening parade and the fireworks display was a treat to watch and made up for the day's misery.",2
"We live in Japan and decided to hop over to Hong Kong and check out Hong Kong Disneyland. We went to Hong Kong Disneyland with two kids ages 7 and 4. The actual entrance is down a long pathway that takes 10 minutes to get to from the hotel drop off point. We were told the park opened at 10:30 so we arrived 45 minutes before rope drop time. But we when got there, people were already allowed into the park. Which was strange. We went on a weekday and even though the park opened at 1030. Toy Story land diddon't open until 11 and closed early at 8. Many restaurants were closed but we weredon't sure if they were closed because it was a weekday. We wanted to eat at Explores Club restaurant but it diddon't open until 12. We notice many snack food stands did not open until 12. We rented a stroller inside the park which cost $100HKD   $100HKD deposit you will get back when you return the stroller. If you want to do Jedi Training for ages 4 12 do the sign up first thing when you get in because it will get full. We bought tickets at DisneyLand Hollywood Hotel the night before. We generally dodon't go to the most popular rides first we went until the end of the night when the crowds die down and there isdon't a huge wait. One of the most popular rides is The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh that is also a FP but we opted to go right after the night parade and the wait was only 15 minutes. The Buzz Light Year ride we went right before the firework show at 8:50 and there was no wait. The kids loved ToyStory land and went right when it opened at 11 and we waited only 5 minutes for the rides. You are allowed to bring in food and drinks. Personal space does not exist and people will be literally on top of you when you are in line. We watched Festival of the Lion King which is great and we waited outside. We diddon't understand why we coulddon't wait inside the air conditioned theatre. People will try and cut in line so beware. Our little 4 year got pushed by adults because she walked too slow. We had to carry her prior to waiting for shows because she almost got trampled. Would I recommend going to Hong Kong Disneyland? No. If you have a chance go to Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea. Even though it crowded people are polite and wait their turn. ",2
"every time i went to Hong Kong, i went to Disney.and the last time i went was disappointing.The staff were very rude, i think 80 percent the staff were rude, they did not only rude with me, but with my sons, nephew, sister, parents and with the other customer.I know it was very hot in July, but they must have some standard to take care of that matter.Many other customer dodon't like to queuing",2
This Disney land is a pore copy of the real Disney land in America. The rides are very short and have to wait in queues in stifling heat for 20 minutes until you get inside for another 20 minutes wait in the air con then a 60 second ride. At 358 hkd it is not good value. I wodon't be going back.,2
We were so excited about this day trip that we planned. It is very expensive and my older kids (23 and 21) found that there is not enough rides for young adults. In comparison to the one in Singapore this was not worth the time or money. The cooldrinks and water was over prized. Will not recommend Hong Kong Disneyland,2
I went here last year as I'm a Disney fan the travel agent said to get a 2 day pass not worth it as it smaller then the other Disney l went for the day instead as there was a category 3 typhoon was arriving so it was raining they closed the rides only thing that was open was the shops.They dodon't cater for westerns and the dodon't understand English.,2
"If you have been to other Disneyland, keep your expectations low when visiting Disneyland Hong Kong.Featuring only a few attractions, smaller land area and water downed rides (uhmm yes... I'm talking about Mystic Manor). You cadon't help but compare this to other theme parks and Universal Studios SG offers more than this one.On the plus side, well there's no long queue here for the  It's a small world  attraction.",2
We were disappointed in our visit here. With children over 11 being Adult prices it was an expesive day.....particularly the food and drink prices. We were there during extreme heat so diddon't get to see everything because it was just too hot. Waiting in ques for rides was so hot   no relief from the heat. (Unlike the Gold Coast theme parks in Australia where there is water mist and fans to cool you) Our 13 and 15 year olds were simply too old for this place and we would have been better off sightseeing elsewhere and saving ourselves a stack of $.,2
Nothing special if u had earlier visited another Disney. But for children good place to enjoy. Lot to walk. Pick discount coupons near inside entrance to avail discount on soft drinks etc. lol for them n ask for coupons . Jungle ride good. Tarzan good for kids. Dodon't leave ur belongings. Careful. Carry water enough   2 bottles per head. ,2
Usual Disneyland affair but disappointing as it is a lot smaller than other Disney affairs e.g. Florida. This makes the experience much less real as you can see the mountains etc   so you know you are not in DL but actually in a theme park in Hong Kong.At least the tube station was fun with Mickey Mouse themes throughout.I woulddon't recommend it but if you are a Disney fan then it might be worth a visit just to say  I've been ,2
"My Daughter had been wanting to go to Disneyland for quite some time so this year we decided to celebrate her birthday at Disneyland. We went in the month of June and it was Super hot. We were literally burning. It's all in the open, there are no shaded areas. Thus we were so tired in just 2 3 hours. Could not really enjoy anything. Except for the princess show which was in the auditorium, I diddon't really like anything over there. It's not worth the price we have to pay. My kids also diddon't really enjoy much. ",2
we were there as 5 kids and 4 adults and entering there we were told we can use our ticket to only one ride for priority and later found it they only have winne the pooh show seperate priority lines that too has limited time entry and a wait time of 1 hour in priority.. by the time we had reached there that line too was closed for the day..in all we cud only do two attractions such was the waiting time..ocean park is much better as we atleast spend time to enjoy rides...felt like cheated ,2
"This is the smallest disneyland ever, the staff are very unpleasant! Boring staff! Dissapointed with the refurbishment of tomorrowland! A very small Magic Kingdom! The knky good thing maybe is the transportation by MTR and the shop in the main street section and they have a short fireworks dont waste your time watching that!",2
"Visited in 2010, and with a 3 year old. No evidence visited with 9 year old and 2.5 year old Sister. The atmosphere is totally different. The Disney Magic is lost. Used to like the loud Disney songs that is played the moment you reach the main gate,but this time round, the music was soft and not continuous. Stayed one night in Disneyland hotel, hotel was old and worn out, and worse, the sewage smell was horrible. Service crew were all angry folks and you can see that they are unhappy, for some reasons. Rather disappointing. Disney has lost its charm.",2
"Having been to California Disney many times, Hong Kong pales in comparison by far. Fewer rides, different vibe, awful food. If you have time and want to spend the money, go. Just know what you're in for. We struggled to find enough to do for 5 hours, rode a few rides multiple times even, and were done. We went in November when the weather was decent and found it warm. Cannot imagine going in the heat, let alone with children. ",2
The park is small and some great rides closed in the limited number of rides that they have. The biggest thing missing in the park is the not so friendly staff missing the expected Disney smile and courtesy be it the ride operators or folks in the restaurants. Not recommended if you are a big fan of the  Happiest place on Earth  way of functioning of US Disney parks which they take literally ,2
"This is the second Disneyland I have been to after the one in Anaheim. It was my first trip to Hong Kong however and perhaps the review I'm leaving is due to having not experienced the culture here or the people, but it was my experience.The pushing and shoving to get onto each ride was ridiculous. Mothers yanking their screaming children past others to get good seats. I was trodden on multiple times, had my face scratched by umbrellas and selfie sticks (which are prohibited but not policed). On every ride we went on all you could see were the flashes from cameras. On the Mystic Manor ride you coulddon't see the projections because everyone was filming it.Aside from the other people there, half of the park was not open. There was a typhoon warning 3 when we arrived and were told none of the outdoor rides would be open at all. Then when we left at 2pm we were told the outdoor rides were about to open (good thing we diddon't leave). All the while all of tomorrow land was closed.We ended up going on about 4 rides multiple times as they were our only options, while getting pushed and shoved and blinded by flashes.",2
this was our 3rd time and went there to check the new attractions. the day was almost enjoyable until we had our lunch at Clopins festival of foods   particularly this lady and guy manning the centre portion of the fast food. THEY WERE SO RUDE! Now am not surprised why this place is loosing to Ocean park its because of these types of people with ill manners and bigots! Disney needs to call their attention and have them re trained to be customer oriented.,2
There's nothing special. Too expensive. The most popular attractions were closed. It wasdon't beautiful the whole park. Better visit Paris or Tokyo Disney. I was disappointed and felt like throwing my money into a garbage bin.,2
We visited on Monday only to find 2 of the main rides closed (space mountain and the runaway train) We were only advised of this after we purchased our tickets Considering the park is so small this led to a very disappointing dayThere were no details of this on the website and no ticket reduction offeredIf we had been made aware of the closures we could have arrange an alternative date when I'm sure would have fully enjoyed the Disney experience despite it being a small park.,2
"Went there and it was SLIGHTLY drizzling. It was signal number 3 (this was posted but no further details or notes added). Upon paying and entering we found out that NO outdoor rides would open that they and at around 12NN they announced that the fireworks is cancelled. We went home at around 1PM and saw that the line was still long at the entrance, the customers had no idea that Disneyland rides were not to be used that day.A sign outside along the signal number 3 should have been put. What a waste of HK549 and HK109 (food). I went to HK for this.",2
"This was my 2nd time there. I bought the combo entrance from a website 'klook' which was inclusive of the entrance fee & a meal. As there are 13 of us which some were muslims, the only halal cafe will be the one at the Adventureland...& it was closed on that day. It wasnt stated on the Disneyland website or neither am I been notified or been highlighted that the cafe will be closed on that day (when i actually hv to specify the date i am going upon booking). We hv to search high & low for a halal cafe & was given ONLY 2 choices of meal which indeed was lousy taste. Some of the games were closed & the rest does not meet my expectations. So as the parade too...very boring. ",2
I visit Disney on Thursday at 10.00 am its was not crowded put most of the things was closed to 12.00 and its so smaller than the one in France ..and there wasdon't international food only local food ..and fish smell all over the place. .its waste of time i dodon't recommend it at all. ,2
"Was really excited to visit disneyland however 2 of the first roller coaster rides we visited were out of order for the whole month.. no good to me.. we continued on and went on a few rides, but each ride had about a 20   45 minute wait. U spent majority of your time in lines than actually enjoying the park. (need a whole day to really enjoy everything)I did enquire about an express pass.. but they said none left. which diddon't make much sense to me considering when i entered there actually wasdon't an express line.",2
"If you've done the real thing in Los Angeles then be prepared to be disappointed. It's just not the same. The rides are obviously tailored for local attraction and not what westerners would think are really great. Not a whole lot to do, it was very basic, and for the price we thought very let down by a Disney product. I woulddon't recommend to anyone wanting the Disney experience to go here. Food  no good, rides  no good, Disney feel  nope not at all. The locals may like it, we diddon't. ",2
"Having said that you are in Hong Kong.Much more of an expensive place than the states.Water, ice creams, meals etc overpriced but so is Paris, Tokyo,Having taken my children to them all over the years, if I see mickey mouse I might have to kill him..Bottom line, kids love it Disney know how to put on a parade and if i was still six i'd probably stay all week instead of being dragged round Kowloon by my dad.",2
This is the second Disney land I have visited after Orlando and I diddon't like it again. Those parks are just overrated with too many people and little rides.For the rides you need to wait for long time and even for kids is not so much to see.Prices in the park are as usual overpriced as well. If you are in HK just a short time go to Ocean park which is a bit better. ,2
"We love theme parks and have visited several theme parks around the world. Unfortunately this is the worst we've been so far. This was our second visit to Disneyland in Hong Kong. The park was overcrowded with long queus. Due to the guests from mainland China there was a lot of queue jumping which resulted in a lot of fighting and pushing. The staff of the park did nothing to control these people. We stayed for four days but after day two my children did not want to go to the park anymore due to these rude, unbehaved guests from the mainland. Toilets are disgusting with human feces on the floors   again due to these uncivilized guests. The staff are rude and not all of them can speak English. They shout and scream at everyone. It was hot and all queues are in the sun. So be prepared to stand for hours in the sun in a queue with people pushing and breathing on you. I cannot recommend this park to anyone with small children. During the parades adults are pushing you. On more than one occasion I almost dropped my child due this. I visited this park about seven years ago and it was totally different. It definitely worsened over the years. If you are looking for a fun filled family vacation at a theme park, please AVOID this one at all cost. Rather go to the more civilized Disneyland in Tokyo.",2
"We were quite excited to come here and getting here was super easy on the MTR underground and overground. However we sadly slightly disappointed as we were expecting more Disney characters walking around. My daughter really wanted to see the Frozen characters which were advertised on the website as being in Fanstasy land but when we got there we could see Sophia the princess working her socks off, but the Frozen sister's were nowhere to be seen. The rides are ok but nothing amazing for a 4 year old. ",2
"Visited HK Disney Land with a close friend, though after the short train ride from HK to the station then onto the Disney Train there was nothing Special .. Once we entered we notice all the rides and attractions were Geared for young Children of 11years and below.. I feel that there are a lot better theme parks that cater for all ages.. Maybe they are just living off the name  Disney Land  will not return or recommend ",2
"Hong Kong Disneyland is not very big, it's ok for one day visit with kids but it's a bit overwhelming with mainland tour groups who skip the queues over your children for kids rides!",2
Prepaid for a 2 day ticket but was only issued a 1 day ticket at the park. Cost us 2 hours to fix at the gate on the second day with a toddler which was so cranky after waiting that long in the rain. Not what you want when traveling on a short trip. They did offer a fast pass onto all the rides which was then rejected by all the park attendants once we were inside so we spent even longer messing around once in the park. Sent emails upon our return and also got no responses. Disappointing with the organization and service but the park is a good size for a 1 or 2 day visit.,2
Dodon't go if you have ever been to Disneyland USA. This place is so small and has no atmosphere of Disney USA.,2
We went there in rainy day so it wasdon't crowded and most of the shows was cancelled it was really small and the crew was rude not helpful and not flexible with young children i will not go there again other Disneyland much more better,2
"This Disney park is the least interesting of all Disneylands in the world, and also the smallest one. It caters only for the youngest ones, with almost no rides and thrills for older.  Far better option is the Ocean Park (see my review for it).",2
A very average Disney. This is our third visit and whilst incredibly convenient if you live in this region this is not a great Disney. It is quite small and overrun with rude tourists who have no manners. They push shove and cut lines which can become infuriating after awhile. The food is also abominable. We were there for 5 days and on the last day we really coulddon't face eating more slop. All that said our 4 year old still loves it. Disney is Disney. But I doubt we will be back. The Disney is Japan is incomparably better. ,2
"Fell short of expectations, kids did not even enjoy, the pipe in music all over the resort got to ones nerves. Over priced food and limited selection. Might be worth a quick visit with I small kids but that is all in our opinion. Have been there twice since they opened but same verdict.",2
"Upon boarding the MTR train to Disneyland you are attracted to the specialised Disney themed train which only has one stop so there is no possibility of getting lost.It was a poor copy of Disneyworld, the street shows were overcrowded and young children could not see the performances properly. There were too many mainland tourists which made the visit even more difficult.The food was overpriced (expected) but more than double from outside was a bit steep. They did not allow food drink from outside.Anyone thinking of going should be warned there even weekdays there are many school group visits, it took us over an hour to get in on a weekday",2
"This was my first visit to HK Disneyland. I have previously been to all other Disney parks (Florida, California, Paris, Tokyo) at least 2 times each park. So I know a little bit about Disney parks.My daughter and I visited HK Disneyland in August 2015. The weather was warm and waiting for rides was an uncomfortable experience. For example, the waiting area for the Jungle River Cruise was a shaded area that only had 2 fans. With many people waiting for their turn for the ride, the air was very stall and it was uncomfortable even to breath normally while waiting for the ride. We went in the English language Jungle River Cruise. I have been to this ride in other Disney parks previously. This ride is normally very entertaining and the comments by the guide are generally funny. Not in HK Disneyland. The guide was not using a PA system and it was difficult to hear him clearly. What I was able to hear of his commentary was not funny or entertaining at all. (Yes, his English accent was also very bad).The park is small compared to other Disney parks, and has limited rides. Many of the rides were the merry go round type of rides e.g. Dumbo, Orbitron, Cinderella Carousel, tea Cups, Slinky Dog Spin. These rides may have been fun 50 years ago, but they do not appeal too much to the younger generation these days. Disney needs to come up with new ideas for their rides.The light parade at night is normally one of the highlights of Disney parks. Not in HK Disneyland. The parade only had a limited number of floats and was over in around 15 minutes.The fireworks display at near the closing time is also normally a highlight of Disney parks. Not in HK Disneyland. The fireworks here were basic type and only lasted a few minutes.As in other Disney parks, food and beverages in HK Disneyland were overpriced.Another negative point here is that many people did not want to queue up in waiting lines and they would jump the lines. This would happen while the Disney park attendants were around. The attendants never intervened to stop people from jumping the lines. RUDE.Overall, our experience was not a good one at all. If you have been to other Disney parks, please skip this one. If this is going to be your only Disney experience, please be ready for limited rides, bad management of park facilities and people jumping the queuing lines while park attendants not enforcing any disciple. One last word to Disney Management; your REALLY need to come up with new ideas for new rides and attractions if you want to retain you park visitors.",2
Bad experience as the staffs service was not friendly and food is lousy. Overall experience bad. Will not recommend any friends nor family there. It's just disappointment.,2
"Dodon't expect a massive Disney experience, this is the smallest of the Disneylands and doesdon't have many rides outside of the really kid friendly one. Large amounts of empty space, gives a sense that the park is half built and that grand plans were not met. One benefit is that on a week day every ride had a wait of less then 5 minutes. Also the temperature on the day we were there was mid 30's and it seems there isdon't a huge amount of shelter to stay out of the sun and with vast gaps in the park you have to walk a long distance in the sun between rides. ",2
"We were very disappointed with the service at the souvenir shop. We bought mugs and after paying asked the cashier if he could pack it in a box or bubble wrap and all he could respond was do you need a bag despite explaining to him (in Cantonese) we were travelling by plane. After much argument, he reluctantly takes out the bubble wrap to wrap the mugs . What disappointing service for Disneyland. Furthermore the water coolers at the entrance was rusty and filthy. Also we had to queue for 2 hours before we could take a picture with Mickey and Minnie. May be more time efficient if they had more stations for the photo taking as the 2 hrs wait included 4 rounds of Mickey and Minnie going in and out to  change . A waste of time for visitors. ",2
"Upon entry was told that all outdoor rides will not be available due to Typhoon 3 but what choice do I have because it's the 7th day of 2 Day ticket which I'm holding.To my surprise (forgot actual name) train ride, merry go round, teacup etc are also consider outdoor rides!",2
"We spent a half day there earlier this week ( we had been planning a full day but left early because it was so boring). Having been to all the other Disneys (with the exception of Japan) I was looking forward to another great experience. I was expecting a smaller park ( something like EuroDisney) but was REALLY disappointed by just how little there was to do in the Hong Kong offering. It looks as though they have just taken all their  baby  rides from the other resorts and tried to pass them off as the full Disney experience. As an adult couple the only rides worth taking were Space Mountain, The run away mine cart and Mystic Manor. We queued for over an hour for  Autopia  only to find that the ride consisted of driving an electric pedal car around a railed track at a maximum speed of about 3km  hour. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!! There were none of the usual aatractions Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones, Small World, Peter Pan, singing bears etc etc  basically, if you enjoyed it at the other Disneys you wodon't find it here. If you are travelling as an adult couple and dodon't have kids under 10 you should go to Ocean Park instead. We are now planning to spend the last day of our trip there as I've heard they really cater for the adult market  lots of roller coasters etc. it seems Hong Kong Disney has decided to focus on the toddler end of the market  which is OK if they dodon't mind warning customers before they pay out $400 HKD !!! I am sure even kids around 10 years old would get very bored here after an hour or so. I'm very sorry to say that Disney have really missed the boat with this one.",2
This park is aimed at families with younger kids so teenagers may find the rides limited.  It is expensive as you'd expect for Disney but it is lacking in the 'magic' that you'll find in Orlando or California.,2
"If you have ever been to Tokyo Disneyland, you will definitely feel very disappointed while visiting Hong Kong Disneyland!Food atmosphere souvenir are no good and no surprising. The park is very small and so is the castle of the sleeping beauty. Just save the money to spend on Tokyo one is the better idea to go!",2
The setting and everything are the same but the spirit and magic touch is not there.  You dodon't feel that you are connected to the casts members,2
Smaller as compared to the one in USA. This place is packed with China folks and I really advise going there during the holidays.,2
"Travelled here with my kids age 5 and 1&1 2. To my disappointment I diddon't see any of the classic characters, Mickey, Donald, Minnie etc. Mostly focusdd on the attraktions that requires 50 60 minutes of waiting each, which is to much to ask for from a any kid. I strongly recommend to skip this if travel with small kids, go to Tokyo instead, it's magic!",2
"Really small and also expensive, particularly food.   The theatre is 3rd rate.   Little kids will probably enjoy it but adults will know it is not value for money.",2
"For what you actually get it's a waste of money. I was curious to see what it was like on my first trip to Hong Kong. The atmosphere is what you'd expect from a Disney park, and it's nice to walk around but in terms of actual attractions it is a bit thin on the ground. By far the worst of the three parks I've been to.",2
"Much bigger than I was expecting. Heard so many stories about how small it is, but with small kids it's actually great. Very good for young kids, but older kids would be bored quickly. As usual, food & drinks are exorbitant. Night parade was greatGiving it 2 stars for no wireless internet in the park.",2
"This is my first time in disneyland, there is too many people, especially people from china ! omg they dont line up, they p every where ! Even the staff dont care what they did ! I dont think staff a well trained.",2
"Over pack with visitors, need to spend long time in queuing up for each of the games.   Even need to queue very long for foods.  Foods is very expensive & tasteless.",2
"Too many etiquette challenged guests added to stress of queuing in hot weather. My young 4 year old was treated to a couple of shouting matches, swearing and shoving. Staff preferred not to get involved most cases.  Overall stressful and unpleasant.",2
"It was a public holiday and the park was full, with lots of excursions and people from mainland China. From the high price of the tickets (and that's where the waiting lines start) to every attraction, you can easily spend almost all day waiting to see or ride some of them. Even the children get bored of waiting, and after some hours they're the ones asking the parents to leave.I was at the Disneyland Park in California and it was much better, still a lot of people but not so much waiting. And there they have some very good rides, comparing to these in Hong Kong. They're childish and mostly appeal to the kids, but maybe that's the idea   although the children dodon't visit the park by themselves?!Oh and the food is also not so good, almost every stall has the same stuff (and sometimes also waiting lines, hey even to go to the toilet you have to wait!)",2
"As a Disney Park enthusiast, I have to say this was a huge letdown. We came early, around 10am and rushed to ride the Buzz Light Year ride, which was pretty alike to the Florida attraction. After I came off the ride, I was surprised to learn that all the attractions had been shut down due to technical failures and there was no estimated time that rides would be back up. I left after less than 2 hours in the park. This park doesdon't even quality for a comparison to its Florida or Cali counterparts, nor does it deserve to bear the Disney name.",2
"After 24 days of travel in China, I decided to satisfy my daughter's insistent requests to visit Hong Kong Disneyland. Well, that was a disappointment: the park is very small, expecially when compared to the ones in the US, and, considering the number of visitors, the time spent in the heat queuing can soon become unbearable (only 2 attractions offer fastpass). The cost of the entrance ticket is huge and even drinks and food are quite expensiive.I also found the park lacking some of that special Disney atmosphere which makes Disney theme parks unique and attractive not only to kids but also to adults.The park is very clean and, unlike other reviewers, we did not have any problems with the local visitors.",2
"It's the usual Disney experience but be prepared for a few extras, like pushing, shouting and spitting Chinese tourists. Trying to get a table for food is chaos. The food selection and taste is pretty poor anyway.Worth a day, but nothing more and it's a poor relation to it's bigger siblings in the USA.",2
"I'd held off going to Disney for years. But I was finally convinced to give it a go. I'd previously enjoyed the Disney resorts in Paris, Tokyo and the USA. Firstly, this place is tiny compared with the others and has a lot less to do or see. Further, the day I went it was over crowded to the point of being uncomfortable. The unappealing food on offer is expensive. I was surprised to see people smoking. Apparently smoking is allowed in designated areas, however the rules dodon't appear to be enforced with people smoking in the line for rides. The staff appeared unwilling to do anything about this. I wodon't be back.",2
This Disneyparc is too small and overcrowded with China mainland visitors. We have seen 2 other Disneyparcs and our kinds loved those. In this parc they wanted to leave after lunch and go back to Ocean Parc   Homg Kong island,2
"Too small, too crowded, bad food.  Long lineups and some tourists are too eager and tried to jump the queue.",2
"Good...1. The theme park is well maintained. Facility is accessible and clean.2. Staff are friendly and well presented, professional.3. Close to airport and Disney styled subway is fantastic.Bad...1. Admission is too expensive.2. Packed with nasty visitors. Queue jumping happens all the time. There are nasty people purposely enter your view when taking photos. Someone worse even dare to tell you move away (unfriendly) because they want to take pictures. Completely disasters!!3. Games are not exciting enough. I guess it's because they need to care about younger kids.4. Food is expensive. Although you would expect that but management can control it better.I believe it can be demographic issue, since I never come across all these bad things in American and Japanese Disneyland.Good luck.",2
"I came several times and used to enjoy it more, the rides and shows are still great but it's truly getting too over crowded and staff are less and less friendly in a supposed to be a happy place.",2
What do you expect? It is Disneyland. It is small compare to its north America counterpart. Quiet crowded I would say. Especially when you come in some Chinese public holiday like may first or the national day. Usually a long queue for rides unless you choose ur visit day wisely. Weekdays are better and go early or better late must package tour leave before 1600. I go there because I have a kid of 32 months and my wife like Disney character. It is not bad a place to relax and have a little bit of fun when it is not crowded. But why read the review? You will go anyway if you have planned to go. You wodon't go if Disney is not your cup of tea. My point is you got what you ask for. But not much more.,2
"I shamelessly enjoy the Disney parks all over the world, as a child, and now as an adult. HK Disney falls short, however. It is SO crowded, and even with the long lines, it takes about half of a day to see everything. I love the magic of Disney, but HK just hasdon't managed to capture it.",2
"We did it so the children can tick it off. Would I ever recommend it   no unless I lived in Hong Kong.It is beautifully landscaped and clean and easy to get to. Apart from that it is aimed at sub 8yo I would guess and for that it is well done. It is Disney it's expensive for all things   entry,memorabilia and food.Buy tickets online,it helps a bit. We deliberately avoided the weekend so the queues were tolerable.There are other theme parks more worthy in Hong Kong.",2
"We went to disney hong kong as a lot of people say is very nice. We went on monday which was a good choice because it was not busy. When we came in and arrived at main street i excpected that this where real buildings but most of them are just front panels with on top plastic printed canvas looked cheap. As we are a family of 3 and our kid is 11 years old he looks for rides but all in all there where maybe 8 or 10 rides which he likes or are fun for him. We Walked all the park and within 4 hours you seen every thing. You would think the disney figures would walk the park but no. Also most of the buildings are either food kiosk, restaurants or souvinier shops. The best area is adventure land which is setup nicely. If you are in hong kong and you want to go to attraction go to ocean park much better. For the price 499 for adult it was a disapointment",2
"We booked our 2days pass tickets in UK via the web site before our holiday in HK. It's really for our 3year old daughter as I've been to the one in Paris and Florida and thought it would be nice to spend some family time in a magical place.Good job we got a 2days pass as the following attractions rides were out of order: lion king show, run away mine train and slinky ride at toy story land. Hopefully lion king show will be available on our 2nd visit.Diddon't realise you have to obtain some form of token to be able to join the queue to take photos with the Frozen characters so when we arrive at the area at 2pm we were told all token pass for the day have been all given out and we will have to come back another day.Fingers cross we can get a token on our 2nd visit tomorrow. Overall the Disney experience isdon't one of my best in HK, and the park isdon't big enough to spend a whole day with the family.",2
"HK Disneyland has a relatively small amount of rides compared to other amusement parks. It will be amusing for children till the age of 12 maybe, but teenagers will not find it fun. Most you will need to spend is around 3 hours at the park.",2
"We were very disappointed with the fake Cinderella painted on cardboard... It really spoiled the experience (and our pictures) for our trip... Shame on you HK Disneyland, that is just not right, with all the money you make, the least you can do is have a proper castle as the center of your park!",2
"I've been here twice already. So I get a bit of a comparison. Attraction wise not much have changed since my first visit around 5 years before. So it seems that HK Disneyland does not progress very quick. It even has less entertainment going now. Previously there are lots more entertainers going about the park, such as the princesses taking photos with the kids, bands using garbage can, guys on stilts, and so on. The second time, we only got Chip right beside the entrance taking photo, and later on Stitch in the area. No other entertainer met during our whole day there. and it seems a massive decrease of entertainers compared to 5 years ago. That's a let down for us and our kids, since we are hoping to meet a lot of characters from the Disney World.But the real problem lies in the queues. On average we need around 30 40minutes queuing time for each ride. and there are no express lane. there is a system of gaining a fast pass ticket for some of the more popular rides, where it states at what time you should get back to have fast entry to the rides. although this is quite good, the problem is you cannot get any other fast pass before the one you held earlier expires... this is a major problem. For example, I took a fast pas on 12pm, and the fast pass state that I need to get back to the ride at 2.30 3.30pm. now this is definitely too long (2,5 hours) so I need to get back to the ride at 2.30pm and ride it (or wait until it expires at 3.30pm) before I can take another fast pass to another ride. you can imagine if I take another fast pass at 2.30pm it will require me to get back again at 4pm. that is too long. and in the meantime via the regular queue we still have to stand in line for 40 minutes each. I spent too much effort while i was there trying to be effective with my time there. I NEED to be effective since I'm there with small children (as with everyone else). after 3 times queuing for 40 minutes each, children will get cranky for taking so long to ride just one attraction. We also got an incident with another group of people that try to cut our queue. We were there patiently waiting in line and trying our best to control our children so that they can also wait patiently in line, and then another family (that doesdon't speak English too well) tried to cut in front of us. that is the last straw and we had a scene. although this is not Disneyland direct fault, they should have staff and attention board to notify that everybody should queue in line and may not cut in front of anybody else. this is particularly needed since the influx of non English speaking tourists that tends to also have no decent manners in modern society.overall, Disneyland Hong Kong should not use the tag line  happiest place in the world  anymore. We are definitely not happy while there.",2
"Overcrowded, overrated, overpriced.  You should go to Ocean Park instead. More authentic. Never too commercial.  Forget about the Disney dream.",2
"I went to Disneyland in US,France and Japan. Here is the smallest compared with all I mentioned.The parades and characters are ok for small kids.The place is crowded with people form mainland China. We had to wait for the long long time.Facilities are alright. Nothing much to buy in souvenir shop.There are not enough shade in the hot day that make us so tired.Avoid if you have chance to visit disneyland in other countries.",2
"This is relatively small compared with other Disneyland in the world and packed with tourists from Mainland China 365 days a year. The park itself is ok but if you come from a country with your own Disneyland, skip it in your itinerary.",2
"Hong Kong Disneyland is very small in comparing with the Tokyo or in the US. So many people that you have to queue at least two hours for a single activity. Normally, you can have enjoyed one or two activities in the morning, then, find places to eat, then another one or two activities in the afternoon. Then if you want to see the fireworks, you should buy some snacks and then go to find your places to wait. Beware that it is so crowed that you have to wait and wait and wait.And, one more thing you must make sure you dodon't mind, there are too many visitors from Mainland China, their behaviors, sometimes, are examining your patience and tolerance level.If you can go to other Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland is absolutely not your first choice to visit.",2
I think i had been ripped off... went to HK Disneyland and found that the train ride was not available and the Cinderella Castle was made up of Cardboards (upperhalf) but they still charged full price on the tickets...,2
"We took our young kids (9, 7 & 4). I thought it was highly disappointing, expensive and the food was awful. Your choices of food were Asian cuisine or Western fast food crap. That was it. We were dying for something fresh.The park itself, the kids were bored of after half a day. It is a very small theme park, not what you expect from a Disney franchise. The theme parks at the Gold Coast are bigger and have more for everyone. When I asked the kids what their highlight of their 3 days in HK was, they all said the cable cars and the Buddha Temple. Go there instead!",2
"If it weredon't for the lineups, it would take me like 3 hours to go through every thing. The park is really small in compare to other Disneyland parks. There were only a handful of rides you can go for and they are mostly for children 6 years or under. The experience was not impressive and I woulddon't go back in the future at all.",2
"Very Disappointing. It took near on two hours of lining up just to get in. Once inside we did not end up going on any of the rides as the signs said the wait time for all rides were around 1 to 1.5 hours. The crowds in the lines and around the park itself were overwhelming. We were expecting to see Mickey Mouse and other Disney folk walking around and mingling with the crowds to add to the atmosphere of Disneyland, however we only saw these characters in the opening parade. After a long exhausting unadventful day of seeing practically nothing and with a two year old who was worn out from all the waiting and walking and still waiting to see  Mickey Mouse  we ended up leaving before the night parade and fireworks. We went on a Friday so maybe if we had gone on a weekday it may not have been as crowded.",2
I went to Disneyland with my family some time in October and I diddon't really like I arrived at 11AM and left at about 4PM because it was boring. There were only a few rides and they lasted for a few minutes. The only person that was available to take a picture with was Mickey Mouse. Their were no other characters to take pictures with. The staff were a bit rude.Dodon't think I'll ever be returning to this Disneyland again.,2
"It was a very good place to visit back then, but now it is getting unorganized and the environment getting  polluted    dirty by groups of uncivilized local tourist making the place so uncomfortable to visit now. Any chance to monitor this?",2
"HK disneyland is small and not very good. For starters, about half of the buildings on main street USA were wall paper of buildings and not real buildings themselves. It is only worth it for those that have never been to any other Disney Park as this is the worst one of all. I have been to all other Disneyland Disney Worlds, and always felt that one day wasnt enough. With Disney HK, I saw all the attractions and rode all the worthwhile rides in about 3 hours.",2
"Hong Kong Disneyland is tiny but yet costly.Very few selection of rides and need to queue for quite some time.In order to spend time more efficiently, I suggest going there after lunch or even later in the afternoon for following reasons (if you wodon't go for all the rides):1. Avoid overhead sun2. Save money on food and drinks in the park3. Do not need to wait for hours for the night parade4. Great sunset",2
Payed 150 USD for 2 adults & a kid.   It's only to make money & the amusement is not so special.   If you want to eat or drink calculate a lot of money. It's wasting time there.,2
"If you have visited the Disney parks in America, this will be a major disappointment. For example, Main Street did indeed have storefronts on one side of the street, but the other side was a painted canvas! The main Disney Park features are there, but the quality is so poor it does not create the illusion I associate with a Disneyland experience. What was of interest to me is the park was built taking into consideration Feng Shui. If you are a Westerner visiting this park, take the time to understand this feature of the park to distract you from its shortcomings.",2
We diddon't like this very much. We were so excited to be going to Disneyland and had prebooked a 2 day pass and diddon't even stay for one full day. If you want to buy select Disney products   it is good (not all though). Every  shop front  was another gift shop. ,2
"If you have extra money to burn and extra time to kill and have never been to another amusement park   then you might enjoy this one. If you have ever been to almost any other park   and if you are from the USA and have even been to a large county fair   you will be disappointed. The few rides there are are very short (slinky dog ride in Toy Story land only made 6 loops around the tiny track, swinging race car ride only swung 3 times). Space Mountain is not similar at all to the one in Orlando, and the two other rides geared more towards older kids (Grizzley Gulch roller coaster and Mystic Manor) were both closed due to technical issues the day we were there. This park does not have that many rides that are of interest to kids over the age of 8 9. Mickey's Philharmonic show was good. We went during the Halloween special time of year and did go through one of the walk through haunted houses and it was ok, but the line was so long for the second walk through haunted house we did not go to it (over an hour wait). The scary storytelling session was  sold out  so fast we did not get to go to it either.The food at this park is way below expectations for a Disney Park. At the suggestion of the staff members (who we ask where are the best places to eat), we went to Royal Banquet Hall and also at the Explorers Club. We are very open to new foods   seek them out in fact   but Disney did not come through with these offerings   blah, and uninspired.Staff members were nice and honest. They told us a one day pass was enough, not to buy two. They told us to just buy 2 of the special 3 for 1 price dining coupons and share with our kids   and they were right that was the best thing to do (guess they knew we would be less than impressed with the food). Restroom on the Tarzan Treehouse Island was in terrible condition (dirty). Other restrooms we went to were acceptable.Over all, unless you are a huge Disney fan and want to check this off as a Disney Status been there   done that park type thing, pass this up and go to another amusement park.We went on a Friday in October and the weather was great, the lines for rides (the ones that were open!!) were good in the morning, but by 2 by they were silly long.",2
"Having been to Florida and Paris Disney land previous to this I would say it is pretty poor. The resort is very small, less than half the rides and more aimed towards small children. I was more disappointed that it wasdon't decorated more for Halloween, it had the odd decoration and the themed rides. As it is Disney I thought they would go all out. Good if you havedon't been to the other Disneys and have small children.",2
Main problem with this park is down to lack of organisation (or lack of staff) on queues to attractions. Mainland tourists barging through without any respect for others. Adults sending on their kids ahead through the queue and then making petty apologies to pass as they queue followed to catch their offspring. On entering theatre for Mickey's Philharmonic it was basically a  free for all  scramble to be seated   no staff to usher patrons across to far side seating which meant that we had to more or less  climb  across everyone to reach end seating. Toilets were very unclean. Cleanliness in food areas however was ok. The park itself is small by American standards but that is not a downside but it's overpriced for what is there. Overall we left the park early cause our experience left us pretty disappointed. This park's management need to visit other Disney Parks to learn about customer service and satisfaction.,2
"I have been HK Disneyland last week, the theme parks are not fancy, not enough facilities in that. And also too many people is a big problem. I think Disneyland in LA and Tokyo is much better. so dont wait time here.",2
"not amezing disneyland in hong kong and tomatch normal show and normal resturant ,,,last not go agien",2
"If you like massive crowds, steaming hot weather, queuing on average for 90 minutes per ride, then go for it, spend your money and have a great day! For us, a family of 5, with 3 children (12 8 6) this place was a nightmare. We arrived at the park at 8:30am, at this time of the morning the queues were manageable, almost non existent, we where in the park at 9am and headed left to Grizzly Gulch, no lines road the ride twice, then down to Mystic Point for the Mystic Manor, one ride, then headed to Toy Story Land, R c Racer twice, parachute drop and Slinky Dog once. So far so good we thought...however that was the last ride we did for the day! By the time we made it to Fantasyland at 10:45am the queues for the rides was 45minutes, for a single rider, by the time we then walked through to TomorrowLand queues were anywhere from 75   90 minutes per ride. Personally I think you must be mental to line up for that period of time under a hot Hong Kong sun, and be pushed around by mainland Chinese tourists, who have a very different understanding of social etiquette to us. Given the choice I would give Disney a big miss in August, it is right int the middle of the Chinese school holidays, and given that Hong Kong plays host to over 40 million Chinese tourists per year, it feels like every single one of them is visiting Disney on the same day.",2
"This park is very small when compared to Orlando. This is our second visit and each time we have found that if it rains all the rides shut down and as their is almost nothing else to do, you end up walking around the park in the rain. We arrived, did the Carosel ride, then went to do Buzz Lightyear (60 minute wait) to be told the ride was closed due to weather. We walked around trying to find something to do and eventually gave up and went for lunch. We had very long lunch (very good food) and then went out to find the rides were still closed. We went to Lion King show (people were panicking in the lines there were so many people waiting), we came out and still the rides were closed. We checked and saw that the afternoon parade was still going to happen so stayed for that; what a waste of time, about three floats and over in minutes. Still the rides were closed. The rain wasdon't heavy and their wasdon't thunder over the park. By late afternoon we gave up and went home. We had bought expensive tickets to ride for 3 minutes on the Carosel!!!! if there is any danger of rain dodon't go to the park. Ocean Park is a much better place to visit on any day.",2
Firstly I have to say I've been to the original Disneyland twice so was up against an amazing theme park .If you have tiny children I suggest this park but if you have older children they will be bored.It was crowded and we had so many umbrellas shoved in our faces by rude adults. On a side note was looking to buy my grumpy memorabilia but there was nothing .. Now wishing I'd bought the grumpy mug in the London Disney shop... Oh well,2
"It is extremely small and way overcrowded. It is so disappointing that the park is packed with people. We were the waiting for the park to open that day but only managed to play like two games only. After the second game we decided to go to other side of the park just take photos with the characters. It is a beautiful park, but things you can do is very little. We barely took photos without others in the background.",2
"The park was busy   but we expected that in mid summer. However, we did not expect to find such limited shade. Of course we expected roasting hot weather in August in HK   but expected the facilities to take the local weather into account and give much better opportunities to cool off out of the sun. Many people chose to use umbrellas to give them some personal shade   unfortunately this added an unwelcome element of danger as we found ourselves trying to preserve our eyeballs from being impaled on umbrellas wielded by people with an impaired sense of spatial awareness.We are Caucasian European and found that our small son gave Mickey Mouse & Co a run for his money in the photo opportunity stakes   although we already aware of his extreme cuteness and handsome features (inherited from his parents) it was, initially, quite amusing that he proved to be so popular   however, some people might find this quite disconcerting   it did wear rather thin at the end of a hot day with little respite from the sun! Particularly as the photographers tended to stare and point at him before snapping his photo. If we were ever to go again (which we wodon't) we will charge per photo .... And use the cash to buy a particularly pokey umbrella!!",2
"My daughter (14) and I visited Hong Kong Disneyland last week. This was to be her birthday treat. It was a very unpleasant day due to the heat and crowds. There was no evidence of the Disney magic as crowds of people sweated it out in queues of up to 50 mins waiting for rides. There is inadequate rides and facilities which are air conditioned. Space Mountain was good and Mystic Manor was worthwhile but the rest was not worth the effort of standing in 30  temp waiting in line. I dodon't know why they dodon't rethink the queuing areas and air condition where possible. We arrived at 10am (opening time) and already it was over 30 degrees. In summer, why dodon't they have an earlier opening time of 8.30am before the heat gets too bad?I had read on trip advisor that many rides are more suited to younger years and that's true. I am very pleased that we diddon't take our 15 year old son. To summarise, this particular Disneyland is just a theme park for children 12 and under with rides that happen to have a Disney theme. It is aimed at locals who may not have the opportunity to travel abroad and witness the real Disney magic. ",2
"Went there with family expecting to find that fun, kiddie friendly theme park and was so disappointed when i saw that most of the people there were grandpa's acting like kids... There were no kids, or teens, or young people. It was sad really.",2
"If you have already been to Disney in L.A. and Tokyo, I would suggest you skip Disney HK. The park is big but the rides are limited. And there's also no ample shelter and sitting area for visitors who would like to take a rest from all the queuing and walking. Just remember to bring an umbrella and slab on lots of sunblock if you are visiting the park in the summer.We bought a 2 day pass but felt that a 1 day one would be more than sufficient.",2
"If you have been to Paris and Orlando, I wouldnt recommend having high expectations. I was really disappointed, the castle was absolutely tiny. Not too many rides either.",2
"I' ve visited HK Disneyland with my family (children 7 & 13) in a not so busy day. The kids covered the attractions in 3 hours, including repeated visits to few of them. They were both very disappointed; the number and size and quality of the attractions was very poor comparing to expectation. It seems to me like this Disneyland is made a trap for Chinese who have less experience to disney world in general and consequently are easier satisfied. I have no opinion on food as we diddon't have lunch since the kids wanted to leave the place immediately.As one could expect, i found it very expensive for what it offered to my family. Visited April 2014",2
"to begin with the tickets were so costly. I have visited LA DL, FLoria DL and this one and i found that this one was more expensive compared to the one in the US. When we went it was raining so badly, and we had...More",2
"I stayed in Hong Kong for one night only, just to visit the HONK KONG DISNEY LAND, I was expecting something like dreams as told by friends visited Euro Disney and Orlando Disney land, but it was in HONG KONG so basic, and very crowderd because of the Chinese new year fastival.the worst thing ever was the attitude of the staff, they was very tough and shouting in people who are coming to HONK KONG as guests!for me, I think I am not going bak to HONG KONG DISNEY LAND, that was a really bad experience I ever had!",2
"We bought a 2 days ticket, but please dodon't repeat that mistake! Fast pass option was not even offered by the staff in the counter and the queues are incredibly long. The Disney characters are pricey too and do not wander around the Park.... And, unless you are staying up in the Disneyland Hotels, forget the fireworks show, as transportation to city is tooooooooo long, in terms of time.",2
"We had a brief and expensive outing here and will not be returning. The queues were ridiculous, it was a tad scruffy and all in all a big con. Hong Kong is incredible, this lets it down big time.",2
We took our 3 and half year old to Disneyland on the first Friday after the Chinese New Year. As most people were still on their holidays we were expecting it to be packed out. It was very crowded with queues at all the attractions....More,2
I suppose your reception and and enjoyment may largely be due to your country of origin. HK Disneyland was designed for Main Land Chinese. For others it is expensive... the food is uneatable and the attractions poor. If you have ever been to Disneyland in Anaheim or Walt Disney World cherish the memory and give this one a miss. Basically for Main Land Chinese and HK Residents that have small children and need a place to take them.,2
"Unfortunately there isdon't much I can say that is positive about this Disneyland. I've been to the one in Paris and it far out weighed this one. The staff seemed miserable and like they'd prefer to be somewhere else, for westerners it was hard as some announcements weredon't made in English and the shows were in chinese and you had to read what was being said (since when does Mickey speak chinese).....My husband haddon't been to a Disneyland before and was like an excited kid. That soon disappeared. I was very disappointed for him and said I'd take him to the original Disneyland where I'm sure the staff are happy and English is spoken. Woulddon't recommend or go back.",2
"This is a small Disney park. That is fine, and it's all we expected. What we diddon't expect was that we would turn out to be part of the show for the mainland Chinese who flock there. They are brazen in their disregard for privacy (ours) and would snap photos or stand, staring and talking about us. As I speak Mandarin they would be full of apologies once they realised we understood what was going on...still not acceptable. Racism is never a good thing, and being on the wrong end of it is abysmal. The rides are all up to Disney's standards and the queues weredon't too long. All the food vendors cater solely for mainland tastes, there is little for Westerners....that's fine, it is Hong Kong after all, just dodon't go there expecting to find the usual Disneyland.Anaheim wins!",2
"Went there with some friends. I was hugely disappointed. Having been to the one in Tokyo, which was great, I was not expecting this to be better. But it was worse than I thought. Long lines everywhere. Yes, I know this is Disney Land. The worse is the locals seem to think it is OK to cut lines anywhere they want. Even worse is the park authorities allow it! Also, it is not clean. Would not come back again.",2
"if you have the opportunity to visit other Disneyland   Disney world park in other part of the world, just skip this one. It is probably the smallest one.The part that confuse me most is looking at oriental persons with beautiful dark eyes donning blonde wigs to fit some Disney story characters in the parade.Skip it, just so you can continue to maintain the appropriate image of Disney characters",2
"Before i came here i was ready that this is low quality but i was even more disspointed when i c it. (1) landscape outside: trees flowers were not well taken care. (2) parade: costume look very poor quality, remind us truly this s  made in china . (3) games: also poor few game while (4) souvenir shops many expensives but quality is not equal to its price even the small things like key chain. Very  made in china  quality. (5) building along the main street if USA: supposed to be true builing in old style but only one side is built the other side they print the image of old style building . ",2
"Actually Hong Kong Disney is one of the smaller Disney parks. Biggest advantage, there are no waiting times (max 5 Mins) if you come during weekdays. The park is not that big, usually you should be through in half a day (I only took the adult rides and shows). For children might be ok, for adults who have been to other parks like Paris it  s dissapointing. Everyday there  s a fireworks show around 20:00 which is worth watching.",2
"Grumpy staff, long lines, nothing for a 2 year old to do except queue, constant music blaring overly loud music from every corner of the very small park. Basically if you've been to any half decent theme park anywhere in the world, it'll have more to do and have better rides than HK Disneyland. Yes it's very pretty, but i was expecting a much better attention to detail and at least something for small children to do. The day started by us being told off by a member of staff because our 2 year old was having a drink of water on the train (it was a hot day), and went downhill from there.It is incredibly small, we went when it was supposedly quiet, I'd hate to see it when it was busy. It might be better for older children but there's still only about 6 rides so save your money and spend the day looking at amazing Hong Kong and take the kids somewhere better when you get home. Maybe I'm used to theme parks in the UK, USA and Australia but still I was expecting more from Disney.",2
"the park is simply one of the worst in the world. it did not live up to a typical disneyland. disney should just shut it down, seriously. it was so crowded throughout the day. many rides required a queue for more than 30mins. even for...More",2
We are probably spoilt having been to both the USA resorts.We found this very small and very limited. It took us only half a day to go round this resort.On the positive side the resort was very clean and tidy. What they have done was done well. The staff were very friendly and helpful.Not value for money at 450 HK$ each.,2
"Disappointing. One expects more from Disney.  The whole experience was underwhelming. Terrible food, boring attractions and rides that belong to a travelling carnival. We left feeling happier that it was behind us. Ocean Park is infinitely better.",2
"The Good  )~Exact replica of the original Disneyland in Anaheim~Big land size, has enough attractions to last you 7 hours( given u spend 1 hour for each of the 7 lands)~Merchandise is exclusive to the HongKong market~Many food options, even Halal is offered!~Foreigners have subtitles shown for some live showsThe Bad  (~The queues for each attraction is what really pissed me off, I find it offensive that the people are rude & very bad mannered during the indoor & outdoor queues.~Not only do u have to deal with long queues during peak hours, the amount of noise caused while standing in the queue is enough to give me a CONCUSSION!~Merchandise compared to Tokyo Disneyland is INFERIOR, I remembered the tokyo park is selling disney products with nicer & fancier designs compared to the ones offered (at October 2013) at the HK park :(~F&B THROUGHOUT THE PARK IS OVER PRICED!!! Take for example eating a bowl of Beef & Rice@ the Chopin outlet: The beef tasted like it was just taken out of the freezer & the gravy mixed with the rice was unappetizing!!! This is a RIP OFF !!!~Disney has a strict cut off time for its live shows, take for example the  Golden Mickeys Show , no one is allowed admittance to join the queue 30 minutes before the show starts, simply because 45 minutes before the show begins, the crowd@ the waiting area has already exceeded the number of seats in the theatre, so be prepared to get turned away if u arrive less than 30 minutes before SHOW TIME.~As I walked throughout the walk, there were very little disney characters present,even if u saw one...be prepared for a long queue just to take picture with the mascot!My Tip for future visits:~The parade, though short with only (i think) 9 floats,is impressive & will definitely take any kid's breath away!So dodon't be like me to sit down@ the park bench to rest my aching knees...Go & queue up along the parade line route!!! You'll be glad u did that!!!",2
"Before going to Disneyland Hong Kong, I already read the tripadvisor reviews. We decided to visit the park, as we were in Hong Komg anyway. I diddon't expect it to be as nice as the ones in the US or Tokyo but I was hoping that we would at least see a few Disney characters walking around during the October holiday. We only saw Mickey and Minnie at the entrance for taking pictures. That required waiting in line for a while but the line was closed already and we were told to try another place. We only saw the characters during the Fanasy parade. The only character walking around was Jack from Pirates if the Caribean. There are many shops you can go shopping at. No characters on Main Street but they had tons of shops.Our daughter is 20months old. We only went on one ride,  it's a small world  ride. It was very nice and she loved it. We did it twice. We saw three different shows:   The 3D Mickey show was fun with air, water and fragrance effects but the graphics were quite old and not very clear. My daughter didnt wear the 3D glasses but still enjoyed it very much.   The Golden Mickeys was all right.  Festival of the Lion King was very much fun for my daughter. Majority of people were from China. Most people behaved well but a few did try to cut the line. It was fun for my daughter the very first time. But I was disappointed that she could meet any characters up close.Tips: bring your own umbrella when it's hot. We spend about 180HKD on one.",2
"Not even close to the Disneyland in California. The food was horrible and expensive. This is a franchise, so should they have the same food as in Disneyland California?! What happened to the caramel apples, american hotdogs and burgers! How are you supposed to feel the disney spirit without those things? I had their version of a burger and it was down right sad. What a shame, I really wanted to like it but it just wasdon't worth my time. There is hardly any attractions or rides. To those who plan to go, skip it and go to Ocean Park!!! There's so much more to do.",2
"Hong Kong Disneyland is well known small. The walkways to the rides and attractions were narrow, incomparable to Disneyland in Anaheim. We also had learnt a lesson, in future when planning to go to Disneyland in any months, we will make sure to check the China Holiday Calendar of the public holidays and school holidays. This is to avoid    human traffics    in the park. We were there in end of August. It was the last week of the 2 months school lterm break in China. We do not feel we were in Hong Kong, instead we felt we were in China.The small park and the term break in China, had flooded Disneyland on weekday. Adding to that.. it was summer season in Hong Kong. The queues were long on all rides, even the picture taking with the Disney characters. The waiting time for rides from an hour to an hour half. We only managed to take 3 rides and 1 show in our 6 hours time there. Very long queue had to stand under the blazing hot sun and sweat. Visit Disneyland when it is study term in china and also to avoid weekends!",2
Everything looks very old... have a game (cars) that was discontinued years ago from Orlando... good choice to spend a day if you dont have anything else to do in Hong Kong.,2
"decided to visit here in august. decided on a monday to avoid the weekend crowds. it was a very hot day 35deg C . and the park is only 8 years old so the trees arent established yet, so there was very little shade. every second person seemed to have an umbrella, which was very dangerous i got hit in the face and head several times with rude people trying to rush by or push in and que jump. i got on 3 rides and had lunch and that took 5 hours. each ride was at least a 1 hour wait. with lots of unhappy parents and lots of crying or bored children. really if you dont have to visit this place dont bother it is just a merchandise theme park. more shops than rides.",2
"for the price there was only 1 good ride in the whole park ,food choice was good but the shopping was way over priced I would,nt go back",2
"There are things added compared to 2 years back. However, really did not enjoy the day. The crowd and queue put me off. The queue control ( or is there one?) is bad. You patiently queue for your turn but realise that other people will...More",2
"It's small, rides are limited and for young kids only. Most locals wodon't go unless they got young kids to entertain. I've been to all Disneyland in the world and this is by far the worse. If you want to visit a park, Ocean Park is way way better. ",2
"Unless you have absolutely nothing else to do, while you enjoy standing in line with zillions of tourists, I will not recommend this place to anyone with a sane mind. There are other ways to enjoy the city. The rides are average at best, but the experience of waiting was simply horrible. The shows were okay and the parade was fun for the kids. However, comparing with other Disney theme parks, this is one park you can skip and wodon't feel you miss anything.",2
Disneyland is a good place if your kids are accompanying you and that too kids with age  15 years. Cannot compare this place with Universal Studios or Genting Higland as the rides are mainly for kids in disney land except for one or two roller coaster rides...,2
"Been living in HK for the past 10 years and was looking forward to visiting Disneyland in 2006 when it was opened, what a disappointment!!! Nothing comparable to other Disneylands (France, USA...etc) in terms of size, entertainment, attractions, price, space, crowd etc...  Bonded with tourists...More",2
Any Disney afficianados will understand the title line which is probably as much as needs saying. Whilst well intentioned it lack sthe atmosphere some may be looking for.,2
Ocean View still is better... I should have listened to the review.. Grrrr... The time I spent in HK Disneyland would have been better used in shopping... Grrrr,2
"The park itself is very well kept and a great place for the kids, but as a parent having to wait 50 minutes in line for nearly all rides and then getting a ride under a minute is completely unacceptable. The kids were so disappointed. Disney is far too greedy with this and I would probably not visit again because of this. What a shame.",2
"The park was great, and everything. Long lines for the characters, but that is to be expected. Had one issue at the restaurant across from the jungle cruise called Riverview Cafe. Seemed they did not like I was American, who knows. My gf and I ordered food, then two couples came after us and ordered. They ordered heaps of food, we just ordered fried rice and coke. The two couples received all of their food, portion after portion while my gf and I were starving and looking at the other couples with envy. As soon as I spoke to the manager our food came. Call it coincidence or not, but we immediately left and refused to pay. Who knows the true story, but we ate at a different restaurant called The Explorers Club and it was excellent. Just Avoid the Riverview Cafe.",2
We were in line for the picture session with Mickey when they park attendant cut the line and said that it's over. I requested for at least one shot as it was my daughter's birthday but I was ignored and it was as if I was not heard.,2
"HKD 450 for adults, 320 or children is an outrageous price for HK Disney. It completely lacks the Disney Magic and is so small that I could not believe they could charge so much for this tiny park. Take the main Castle for instance. The one in Florida looks like a real castle while this one looks like a miniature put in for the sake of making it look like a Disney theme park. The overall feel of Disney is completely missing from HK Disney. It just does not seem magical at all! The rides barring 2 or 3 are really lame...good for a 5 year old perhaps.The Grizzly bear ride was nice and the fireworks show is good at night. They have provided plenty of water fountains which is good. Snacks are expensive (HKD 35 for a small popcorn or HKD 28 for cotton candy). Inspite of reports that Disney wont allow you to carry your own food, we took plenty of it. I would have strongly argued that they cant decide what I should eat and what I shoulddon't and cannot stop me from taking my own food inside (we are vegetarian so our choice is extremely limited in such places) . They looked at my bags and the food but didnt stop me from taking it in.My honest suggestion is for people to visit Ocean Park. Half the price, 10 times the size (no exaggeration) and much more entertaining. My kids agree! This is especially true if you are planning to visit Disney in Florida anytime in your life. Dont waste time on HK Disney.As of early May if you bought tickets with a VISA card, you could get 11% off at the ticket booth outside Disney. Also bear in mind that all restaurants in the park close when the park closes. This means if you wish to have dinner, it has to be  instead  of the rides. They wont serve anything post the fire works show.",2
To be honest   its for kids. Ocean Park is a lot more fun. Nice and clean but as expected   expensive for what you get.,2
The area is very small. I can say smallest disneyland. We can finish all park within half a day. There are not many rides and no ride for mature!,2
"Pros: If you like Disney stuff you'll have fun at any Disneylands. The Buzz lightyear (laser tag guns) attraction is fun. The Lion King show is really good too.Cons: Lots of rude park guests. One of if not the smallest Disneys. Also, quite far from town (it is near the airport) so if a is airport d is disney and tc is town center, it is like this:a....d....................................tcThere are lots of Chinese mainlanders   I think these are the main source of revenue for the park   so prepare to be shocked by the cultural difference: constant queue barging, invasion of personal space when they are forced to queue (they will probably be sniffing the back of your head or rubbing against your backside)   as if this shorten the queue time, people smoking outside designated areas, ill mannered kids screaming, littering and running around AND on your lucky day you might see the Disney parade as well as the golden showers or golden poop parades performed by Chinese kids.The goods: Buzz lightyear, Lion King show.Tips: Go on weekdays. Avoid queueing with rude looking park guests (the Chinese mainlanders). Get fastpass. The park is REALLY small so if you see a sudden long queue at an attraction, just come back later. It'll save you a lot of time.",2
Im afraid I was very dissapointed in HK Disneyland. More retail outlets than anything else.  the show i saw (The lion King) was spectacular. the rest was just below average. I wasnt there with any kids so maybe  my views are a bit harsh.,2
"Went here in April 2013 and I was not impressed... or more like disappointed. Getting there is so easy, just take the MTR to Sunny Bay and change to the Disneyland Express. Journey takes about 30 minutes from central Hong Kong. The train is fab and so is the station and the entry... but that was kind of  it  for me. It was a cloudy day, not much people and no real queues to talk about but it took us approx 20 minutes to get tickets to get in, then there was the security line to check the bags. Not a problem but I can imagine the chaos on a busy day. You walk into Main Street and well.. its a street full of shops selling Disney merchandise and sweets... even the bread is sweet and finding anything else became a challenge. We saw Mickey and went to get a picture just to get told that the waiting time was 1.5 hours so we gave up. We worked our way around just to find 3 of the major attractions  closed for reconstruction   sorry for your inconvenience ... doesdon't help me when I paid almost $70 AUD to get in. Where was the signs at the gate that some attractions are closed?It doesdon't really take a lot of time to walk around, I was looking for Disney characters or themes, but I found it scarce. All day I saw Mickey once and Minnie once as well and that was it! Its supposed to be like walking into the  World of Disney , but this was more a  sell as much Disney merchandise as we can , a few half bad attractions on the side and some nice gardens. Another thing were the waiting times... as I mentioned, it was a slow day, not many guests but the wait was still about 15 minutes on most rides... as said before, I dodon't want to be here on a good day... I have to say that the Gulf was a really good ride but the rest of the ones that were open I could do without. I think that if you have young children and you dodon't mind lining up and waiting it could probably be a fun day out, but not for the older ones. To me it was more of a half bad amusement park.",2
"Was my first time to Disneyland, even from a small country, we only have one theme park and I thought it was just so so. This would be great if you were a kid, but it was not as good as I thought. The best ride was being fixed up for Halloween, so very disappointing, still had to pay full price.Strange there were lots of HK businessmen in suits... hmm place for business trips?I diddon't even stay for the fireworks at the end, only stayed an hour or so then left...",2
Have been to Disney Anaheim and Tokyo and this effort is a poor third. Little kids 3 8 will get a fun day but for the rest it does not offer a lot.,2
"Lots of queue cutting from China mainlanders, decent touristy food. Ticket price should lower due to difference in quality from their counterparts from US.",2
The park is too small compared to Japan Disney...the rides are not interesting for adults. The worst part is that I encountered some occasions when other visitors tried to cut lines...it was so annoying...the only part that highlighted my visit when I saw firework performance at night time.,2
"I was at Disneyland a while back and there are pluses and minuses. On the plus side... if you have kids, they will love it, they have decent rides, their small Disney village is cute and there is beauty all around.On the negative side, it's smaller then I expected, not as many rides as I thought and the queues are very long.",2
"We came here not knowing what to really expect as we had heard mixed reviews from friends about DL HK. After visiting, I can say this theme park is really catered towards young children as rides and very tacky, uninteresting and not thrilling.   My title...More",2
"I am not Singaporean, but I can not find better word to explain Hongkong Disneyland. I expect something more grander and big, but I am so dissapointed to see the castle is so small, just like a gate or stage only where it is suppose to be like in a fairy tale. 3D show is blurr for my eyes, and all other game is dedicated only for small children. It is not bad, but also not amazing for me.But I love the food here, it is good and have many variety.....",2
"My family always celebrate Christmas and New Year in Hongkong. Even some of the staffs are not that friendly, we still go there beacuse this is the closest disneylandfrom our country aside from the fact that my children are still happy when they are here (yes, bec they arekids ages 10, 8 and 7).Our latest visit was yesterday JAnuary 1, 2013 and dec 31, 2012. Yesterday was really a bad experience for us. First, we have experienced some of the local residents pushing while we are on queue. But we still manage and kept our composure. But when we arrive at the Toy Story Land (The parachute ride to be exact), the two families in front of us while we are on queue fight. Because of the long queue the two hot tempered family did not stop fighting until the securities came in. We diddon't know what happened next because we ride already. But the saddest part of all is when we bought a lot of souvenirs from the souvenir shop in the Main Street near the exit. I know and i check that I gave the cashier 3 pcs of HKD1000. OUr total bill is HKD 2,268.00. But to our surprise she just gave me a change of HKD 232.00. I ask the cashier and I said that i gave her HKD3,000. She said no and insist that i gave her HKD2,500.00. The lady beside her, i think the supervisor counted the money in the cash register and so we waited. And to our surprise again, they said that our change is correct. We counted again our HKD in my wallet and we are very sure that we gave her HKD 3,000.00. We know, because all our expenses and the HKD that we changed in their money changers since December 29, 2012 are all accounted.We were so disappointed.Lesson learned, when you pay count in front of the cashier and tell her how much money you gave her.",2
"this is my 2nd time at disneyland hongkong. first of all, if u have been to disneyland orlando u will be severely disappointed since hongkong disneyland is very small. u can walk around it in just an hour. upon entering u will have the option of getting the star pass, if u dodon't mind paying an extra 100 hongkong dollars per person. ticket is 399 hk dollars for adults and 285 hk dollars for aged 3 to 11 years old. let me tell u about the good stuff first. view is very nice, the parade was fun to watch but it was a short one only around 5pm if i am not mistaken. now to the bad part... oh my! i am going to start my whining. terrible food! i bought an assortment of food like hotdogs, waffles, chicken wings and pizza. waffles was decent, the other selections was horrible. i was left hungry since it galls me to buy overpriced unsavory food. disneyland staff are ill mannered and rude, and to top it off they barely speak english argh! their guttural and incoherent sentences made me stop asking questions. to be fair to them, maybe they seem rude bec they barely speak english so they cadon't communicate properly but still... i expected better from disneyland staff. some of the staff kept on hurrying small kids that might make them have an accident like falling etc. which in my opinion is not right. queues are very long, u have to wait for an hour per ride and then it will only take 3 to 5 minutes for u to finish the ride :( my son still enjoyed his time in disneyland, he is 7 years old so no surprise there. my tip is this, eat first before u step on disneyland. terrible food!",2
This one sucks compared to the Ocean Peak. The park has very little to see. We spent like 4 hours in the park and already see everything we are interested in. If you have been the Disney World in Orlando then you can safely skip this one.,2
"The tickets were quite expensive but we diddon't mind speding bcoz here's the first place I planed with my friend to go when arrived HK. ,, it's worse than we thought!! Disney Land is quite big.,You might be able to see all the sights in a half day munimum and that day was raining then we just walked around until my friend wanted to see Winnie the Pooh.We expected less crowded but we were wrong,the long queue awaited.....around an hour more and took us around only 10 mins visiting inside!! OMGzzzzz ....really disappointed! We will never go back again ...TT",2
"we stopped by while in transit. taxi from the airport to disney land is only about 100 HKD. if you show your flight tickets at the entrace you will get nearly 50 percent on the ticket.we spent about three hours and felt we had done it all in that time. the park is very small, and there are not many rides. it was ok to walk around, but really not much to do. guess it is fun for small children, but for grown ups the park is to small.",2
"This trip ruined my childhood memories of Disneyland so I would only recommend it if you actually have little ones.There were so many tourists and some of them were pretty rude   shoving in and queue jumping and talking really really loudly.THe rides are boring. If you are after some adrenaline pumping rides at a far cheaper entrance fee, go to Ocean Park.",2
"It is over rated. There are limited rides and very few restaurants with wholesome meals. Prices at souvenir stores are expensive. Be careful of having your pictures taken for it will cost you from HK$100 HK$150 per photo. Better bring your own camera for your souvenir pictures. On the good side, the amusement park is safe and clean even at night time. They have friendly staff and the fireworks are spectacular.",2
"way too much tourists from mainland china. cannot stand some of the in cilvilised and inconsiderate behaviours by some of them. coughing, spitting, shouting, children pee just on the street.... but i think this happen every where they go. not just only disney land, it is just the fact that disney land is a hot tourist place for mainland tourists....",2
"Such a bad experience. 90% were mainland china tourist, lots a pushing a shoving, queue jumping in shop, stall, rides and even toilets. The mainland folks have no concept of queuing. Place was dirty, chicken bone everywhere. Staff unhelpfull, no corwd control, no visible security.They should have build this up in China.I recommend you skip HK and go to Japans Tokyo Dinsey Resort.",2
"1. 90% of the park visitors are from mainland China2. Sleeping on the park's benches3. Disneyland VERY crowded and worst during weekend4. Disappointed with the mainland chinese visitors who will try different ways and means to cut your queue for the rides. Any tiny little opening space, they will try to squeeze through and cut your queue5. Mainland chinese eating and having their own  picnics  around the park and then leaving behind rubbish instead of discarding them into the bins6. Very little characters around the park for photo taking7. All rides are fully packed and you have to wait up to 30 mins minimum for the rides. You wait longer for popular rides!8. Mainland chinese talked loudly and smoked around the park vicnitiyGenerally, if you can, go visit Disney in the US or Tokyo. Avoid Hong Kong Disneyland. You will be disappointed. For the pricey tickets, one deserves a better atmosphere but the disneyland in Hong Kong looks and feel cheap. ",2
"dissapointment for us   very small, very few attractions but kids loved it, especially the parade.   if want to enjoy the place, need to buy fast pass, otherwise need to stay in queues all day",2
"I was really disappointed by how bad this park is compared to other Disney attractions. I knew that it was smaller before visiting, but even with that knowledge I thought it was worse than I imagined. The number of rides is awful. If you want to spend your time queuing to have your picture taken with characters then you're in luck. We had a two day ticket and regretted it at the end of the first day. I'm sure it will continue to attract the Asian market (until Shanghai opens) but it is rubbish.",2
"Combination of humidity, heat and serpentine queues of mainland tourists spoils the Disney experience. We had to wait over an hour in many of the lines. Also some of the shows are in Cantonese and the place a lot smaller, making it a far lesser experience than the US one.",2
"3 time to visit Disneyland, and the worse. Yes there was new attraction, Toy story and Gizzly, an there were very crowed, as the is no space in there Disneyland. This time there was dirt all over in restaurant and the cleaner just stand and look at it with out doing something. I also miss some display in the park where you can see the time to the attraction",2
"I understand how crowded disneyland is, and how hot and humid Hong Kong summer can get. But I do not understand the rude visitors; they are clearly not Hong Kong locals. They will cut in lines for attractions, for food, for bathrooms. One common trick   parents let their kids burrow their way to the front of the line, then the parents will push away people waiting in line to get to their kids... and I do mean PUSHING. People will also smoke throughout the park. There is no enforcement of rules whatsoever. We will definitely not return (we bought two day tickets and we did not return for the second day). Stick to other disneylands outside Hong Kong. One positive note   the staff at the baby nursing station were very nice and helpful.",2
"It's too small for the summer crowds. Like what others said, you do end up wasting 30 40 minutes waiting for pretty much everything. Customer service doesdon't exist. Crowds are rude. If you want to pay to wander around and just look at things Disney, come on in. If you're expecting a true Disney experience, head to LA or Orlando.",2
"Rides were really good, crouds fine. Limited activities, small, took only 3 hours to go thorugh the place & this included a 1 hour lunch. 2 rides broken but others working were great. You can do the full park in jiust a few hours. Worth the trip if you have small children. Argued with guards as I coulddon't take in diabetic food or drinks, very poor.",2
"To reach the place by MTR, drop on Sunny Bay which is just one stop before Tung Chung station.From there you need to look for Disneyland train. Expect to spend a whole day here. Lots of walking, and will be hard due to humid and hot weather on the area. Make sure you bring umbrella and drink plenty of water, the drink here are expensive.First thing to do is to go to Tomorrowland and try Space Mountain   mini roller coaster. Skip the rest of Tomorrowland and go straight to Toy Story land and ride the RC racer. And then the last one is Adventureland with the Jungle River Cruise. That is folks...",2
"As an Aussie, my fiance and I visited Disneyland in Anahiem for the first time in our 20's and we LOVED it, so much so that we returned another time a year later. Im a big Disney fan girl.However, Hong Kong Disneyland was a huge disappointment. It started off promising, we got there by the MTR and was excited to see it had special Mickey shaped windows on the train and hand rails on the roof. We got there and the station seemed impressive...then it started to rain. Ok, cant help bad weather I guess. It turned torrential so we had to buy ponchos to keep dry, and as the line to buy tickets was LONG we were rained on for about 30 45mins before even getting inside.I was drenched by the time I did get in, and the lines were very long. That wasnt so bad, but people constantly pushing in the line that day was getting more than annoying. At the Anahiem Disneyland, all staff members are refered to as the  crew  as everyone is in character, even the ride attendants and people in the shops, everyone is super happy and friendly. Not in Hong Kong, no one was in character and there was no Disney  vibe  at all. It was very disappointing.Not only that, but I was the only one in our group who had been to a Disneyland before, so I was talking up how great it was going to be, and of course everyone else in my group had been dreaming of going to Disneyland since they were kids. They hated it. I tried to tell them this HK one was just terrible, but the one in Anahiem is amazing but they wont listen, they wont be going to Disneyland again after such a bad day at Hong Kong's Disneyland.Lonely Planet's description is spot on, give it a miss unless you have very small children. Only they will like it. Maybe. Its all just a merchandising opportunity at the Hong Kong Disneyland. Its tiny, doesnt have many rides and only has a few of the great rides such as Space Mountain.I would not rate Hong Kong Disneyland, just give it a miss, and I say this as someone who LOVED my 3 day trip to Anahiem Disneyland in my 20's. HK's version of the  happiest place on earth  was very disappointing and there is no atmosphere or happiness whatsoever.",2
"Small and too crowded.  Meals and drinks are also ridiculously expensive.  If you have visited the one in USA or Japan, you can save your time for some other attractions.",2
"I've been to the Paris, Anaheim, Orlando and Tokyo Disneylands and sadly the Hong Kong site is the worst by a long shot. The park is super small and doesdon't have the same scope of services that it's competitor Ocean Park has to offer and certainly compared to the other Disneylands   it's a snapshot experience at best. Perhaps this is due in part to being part owned by the Hong Kong government and the geographic constraints of where it's built   doesdon't matter, skip it unless the little ones are in tow. ",2
This is not even funny to spend money like this and visit.  Nothing even close to Los Angeles Disneyland,2
"FIrstly, this place is small comparing with other theme parks around the world... there was no magical moments as we saw long lines everywhere due to public holidays in China. But again, whether it is weekend pubic holidays or not, there will be long waiting lines due to the demand from mainland China. Fast Pass access was limited to 3 rides which I find it quite ridiculous.Food and drinks were everywhere however as expected the prices were astronomical! Good tip, bring your own bottle water and you can refill at the the drinking stations near the toilets. They charge HKD20 for a small bottle of mineral water! There were many souvenir shops and these are tourist traps and they keep reminding you to buy stuffs are over priced.Overall, a very average experience and would not go back again.",2
"Pathetically small and uninspiring. Not worth the effort to visit, unless you are tired of shopping in Hong Kong.",2
"This was not our first trip to Hong Kong Disneyland and our main purpose was not just to visit Toyland but since it was there, we had a peek to see what the fuss was about. Compared to the  original  sections of HKD, this new section was a major disappointment. Most of the rides are designed for older kids and adults so no joy for toddlers here, unless your tots are adrenaline junkies. Dodon't waste your time, stick with the older parts (which we did on our 2nd day) and have a blast there (and we did)! To sum it up   if you are going to HKD just for Toyland, think twice.",2
"This is the second time I visit this wonderland since 2005. Frankly to say there is not much progress in the park. I pay my visit to Disney in the world many times(from FL LA TOKYO PARIS), this is the least park i would like to go again! Something is missing in this park! which belongs to Disney and Mickey!BTW, Please learn to line up before play!",2
"This Disneyland has been set up to sell T shirts and stuffed toys.  For every ride (of which there are few), there will be 5 outlets trying to sell you merchandising.   One for the fans only   Save your money and go elsewhere.",2
"As much as I want to like HK Disneyland, both times I have gone I have left disappointed. The crowds are out of control   you can hardly walk at times! I felt annoyed as the waiting time for rides, restaurants, anything really, was just ridiculous. Unless you are a very patient person with very patient children I would avoid it.",2
"HK Disneyland has a typical disneyland layout and quality standards, but is missing (1) Pirates of the Carribean, (2) Thunder Mountain, (3) Haunted House, (4) Bear Singing Review, (5) Tiki Birds Singing, (6) Star Wars Tours, and (7) Peter Pan. Furthermore, Small World was closed for renovation. They substituted live shows such as Lion King, Mickey Review and a 3 D film    essentially replacing machinery with low cost Chinese labor. There is also a strange Toy Story area. For a small child's first Disney experience, it is okay; for anyone else it is unsatisfying. ",2
if you've ever been to Disneyland in Anaheim or Disneyworld in Florida you'll be in for a shock at this watered down version of Disneyland that doesdon't have many of iconic rides and attractions of the original. The upside is that you can make it around the park in a day   no problem. There's not that much to see. Food is catered to the China visitors.,2

The themepark is great. It is not Disney's fault that the visitors are rude and unorderly. Children and adults tried to push past us to cut in line every minute of the day. Will not return.,2
"Unless you're a big fan of Disney, this HK Disney park is not really that fun.The shows are quite good, but the rides and other things to do are not really something worth spending money and half a day for. Fireworks were good, but not that amazing.It's not that terrible, we just felt that we should've stayed in the city proper and explored there instead, afterall, we came to HK for the uniques HK culture, sights and food. The park did not really show the uniqueness of Hong Kong, so you can just go to other amusement parks, especially if you're not travelling with kids. Enjoyed Ocean Park way more.Dodon't think I'm coming back here.",2
"Wife and I visited HK Disneyland on Boxing Day. The place was extremely crowded and the ques for the rides were very long and the RC Racer ride in Toyland took 1 hour !I hv previously visited Disneyland Anaheim and in Tokyo, but HK Disneyland by far is the smallest. Missed the haunted house there.",2
Tickets are expensive consider that there is hardly anything exciting to see.  We have been to all the Disney in the US and this one in HK is the worse.  Not recommened.,2
Very small and not as good value for money as Ocean Park,2
"It may be interesting to children, but personally I would prefer other cultural or historic sites. I mean Disney Themed Park, come on, you   re in Asia and you want something America? If you want you can go, but it is not the best Disney Theme Park indeed. Get something authentic when you travel!I went there and saw long lines of people waiting. Admission was not cheap at all. My wife and I took a walk around and decided to end our tour early.",2
"If disney was going to do this then they should have done it properly.Too small,not enough rides and queues for everything.Ocean park for me every time",2
The entry fee is just not worth it. Its small & the entry gate staff acted like the military police. They would not let my children take in their own water bottles & insisted on searching everyones bags.  Never again!!  Ocean Park is MUCH better.,2
"If you have been to any Disneyland, please consider Ocean Park.  This is very small Disneyland.  Good part, on week day in November, there are not many people and the weather is just right, not too sunny, and cool enough to walk all day.",2
It's so  mini  in size comparing to Florida and California.  Not to mention about the overpriced food and beverages.  Go to the  real  Disneyland in US if possible.,2
Cant say I enjoyed the experience but It was wet and rainy.  Not worth visiting if you've been to other Disneyland sites.  A very expensive activity!!!,2
"This park is only really suitable for children under 7 or 8 years of age. We went with our two children (aged 10 and 13) and, in their words, the park was  lame ! There were only two good rides   Space Mountain and Buzz Lightyear. The queue for Space Mountain was long   so make sure you get a free  fast ticket    which lets you go on the ride a little later within a one hour time period. This lets you spend your time doing something else   then you can come back and basically get on the ride with very little wait.The parade was good. The food was terrible! My husband bought some fried chicken which had suspicious looking black, grainy stuff between the chicken and the batter (chicken guts?)   so it was thrown out. It was hard to find any food that we liked. The only half decent food was the Chinese food   but everything we wanted had sold out. BE WARNED   you are not meant to take your own food into the park, as they want you to buy their very, very bad food! Your bags are checked for food as you go though the entrance gates!! We would not go back again.",2
"If you have already been to Anaheim and Orlando you will find HK Disneyland sadly lacking. Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, Small World and Jungle Cruise as well as a bunch of the smaller rides like teacups, Carousel, Winnie the Poo etc. Notably missing are most of the good rides like Splash, Big Thunder, Pirates, Indiana, Haunted Mansion etc. However, we still had an enjoyable day. As always everything is clean and the staff are friendly and helpful, however, the food outlets are awful, when we were there the Comet had 4 meals on offer, but could only supply 1 of them and the alternate restaurant that we found opposite had burger style meals that were not nice, the pork in my friends burger was stringy and dehydrated. ",2
"Disneyland   happiest place on earth? Well HK Disney is a bit of a disappointment.To start with getting into the place takes 30 minutes as they have to check every single bag. When you have thousands waiting to get in, then the queues they provide is certainly not enough. Imagine having kids excitedly wanting to get in, only to have to queue at the front entrance for 30 45 minutes.Also if you diddon't buy your tickets online, you will also have to queue to purchase the tickets first. Lucky we bought ours online, but the ticket printing machine printed only 5 of our tickets when we have bought 6.The HK Disney is smaller than the US Disney, so there are fewer rides and less things to do once you are in the park.Most of the rides require at least 30 minutes of waiting time. On the day we were there, the weather bureau issued a typhoon 3 warning, and as a result they shut down all the outdoor rides. However during the entire day we were there, there was hardly a breeze. The management should be a bit more flexible and reopen some of the rides as there was no risk or danger. The only plus is that the Lion King show is worth a visit. Also you can buy Disney merchandise at the HK International airport so if you must get the Disney toys, there is an alternative.Also food and drinks are very expensive in there. Another minus is the some of the visitors from the mainland have no clues on what a queue is and their children just cut into the queues. Save your money and go to other Disneyland if you must.",2
"We were told by a few local friends that Ocean Park was the best of the two theme parks, but our children voted for Disneyland. Wrong choice! HK Disneyland is very professionally run, ultra clean, and has extremely friendly staff....... but you can pretty much cover all shows and attractions in half a day. To be honest there is very little there at all (.....even with the addition of the seasonal halloween attractions). We got there at about 11am and by 2pm we had done the park! We stayed till the fireworks, but found it had to kill time. There is only so many times you can go on the space rollercoaster (....the only great ride at the moment).They are in the process of building 3 additional areas, but they seem to be several years away from full completion. Maybe in 5 plus yeas this may be a theme park of note, but at the moment it feels like a very distant 6th cousin of Disneyland in the US.The food was also the worst I have ever had at a theme park.We should have gone to Ocean Park and I suggest you do the same.",2
"As we were about to pay at the entrance we were advise that a T3 typhoon 3 was issued and that all outdoor attractions would be closed. Having built up the expectation with our 10 yr old we still went in. What we did not know is that it meant 80% of all the rides attractions are closed. Even though it rained only for 10 minutes that day and no wind, the park had to stick to their policy.This of course meant long cues (45 min average wait) for 20% of rides   not fun.However we found one neat trick   at Space Mountain the cue was 50 min long, but go to the 'single only' cue with no waiting   yeah   we went on 6 times.We found most of the food good and well priced. If you have never been to any other Disneyland and the weather is good, it would be a good day. The park is small so one day should be enough.(This review comes form a family of 3 who spent 10 days at Disneyland and California land in LA and still did not do every ride)",2
"Ok we went the end of August, we have been to Disney in Florida, California, and Paris, the park itself was nice, the staff was nice and that was it. It was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i dodon't see how disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst run disney property. My 9 year old was calling it the most unruly place on earth. you know its bad when kids dodon't want to go on rides because they dodon't want to be pushed and shoved and etc,,,, go elsewhere ocean park is better, the cable car ride to the big Buddha is better.",2
"This is patterned on the original Disneyland with a few cultural variations, but is much smaller. Before you visit, look it up online so you know what to expect. It has the Railroad, Dumbo, Merry Go Round, Autopia, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, Jungle Cruise, Tarzan's Tree House, and others, but NO Star Tours, Toon Town, Haunted Mansion, or Pirates of the Caribbean. Food is noodles and rice, with only a single restaurant for western fare. It was refreshing to have covered queue lines, generally with fans, and Small World was even air conditioned. Unfortunately, it seemed like the Jungle Cruise and Small World boats moved quicker than in Anaheim.Besides being smaller than we expected, what lessened the experience was a general lack of accepted protocol by most of the attendees. In Anaheim, we are used to waiting in line. At this park, queues were largely ignored, and people often went around others pushing their way through the line. Even at Small world, where people are lined up in aisles to get into the boats, people would climb over the seats to get where they wanted. At one show, an altercation broke out as people were pushing their way into the theatre. Park staff tried to keep the participants separated and started the show as they were still shouting at each other across the theater. Even on the Jungle Cruise, the driver (They had separate lines for English and Chinese speaking) incessantly admonished riders to keep their hands in the boat (which got very close to moving attraction parts). People seem to talk louder in this part of the world, always shouting no matter how close (or far away) they are. Most of the kids are wild and unrestrained.The restrooms were much better maintained than Anaheim.",2
"After visiting the original Disney parks in the US and even Euro Disney in France, the HK version is a bit of a let down. The park is really small and has only one real exciting ride, Space Mountain. The rest is mainly food outlets and artificial 'sightseeing' rides. The staff is really rude and does not hesitate to grab you quite violently when you walk in the wrong way. Spending one day at this park, which only opens at 10am, is more than enough. This will also help travelers to avoid the overpriced Disney hotels and stay in downtown Hong Kong where much more exciting things are to be done.",2
"I was REALLY excited to go to HK Disneyland as it would be my first Disney Experience. However, all I ended up with was disappointment.  The bad:  * Lack of rides   as stated by previous members, there is really only 1 good ride for...More",2
I was so looking forward to going here but was very disappointed.  I felt that all that was there were restaurants and shops.  There were a few rides for children but not a lot of interactive things to do.  Please note that the main show...More,2
Do not waste your time in Disneyland. Attractions are boring and the queues are very long (65 min  ) on the very few interesting trips in Disneyland (Hong Kong).,2
"When you've been to US Disney, better skip HK Disney, better visit Ocean Park. Save money and trip, be wise.",2
HK Disney is very small and all attractions can be completed in less than one day.Besides 2 of the most interesting rides are out of action and there is no parade!Compared to Disneyland Paris it is just a waste of time .There is no thrill and the photo sessions with the Disney characters are neither well organised nor well monitored so that one person can stay with them for more than 5 mins!There are so many other things to do in HK!!,2
"First thing first, the ticket entrance to me it is quite expensive considering there is not much to see there. There is a lot of ticket booth, but not many open.The shows queue can be very long and not moving fast enough. Quality of the park is really poor, I think I've been to a better local park that are not Disney brand and still find it a lot better. I think I count a lot more numbers of retail store compared to the entertainments. The music parade was ok and probably the only entertaining part of the whole place.I've just recently came back from Bali, went on their safari park and it is just soooo much better.By the way if you are staying at the Disney hotel it is quite a walk to reach the park. As well getting in was pretty easy, getting out to the MTR can be quite long too, might not be a bad idea to get the MTR round trip ticket in advance so you can avoid the long hot queue.",2
"Disneyland in hongkong is really a smaller more bonsai version of the one in the US and is therefore slightly below expectations. However if u have young kids or even ureself want to relive ure childhood fantasies, u can look at going to this as its the only dinseyland in asia",2
"This is our 3rd trip to HK disneyland. Was there in 2005 6 not long after they open, and the park was awful then, but seems to have improve slowly over time.We are a family of Disney affectionados. Have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland more than fifty times combined. We feel that HK Disneyland is really too small to be called a Disneyland. It has way too few rides and attractions. We came to HK Disneyland to see the new Small World attraction. It was perhaps the best small world of all the disney parks, with numerous disney characters like mulan, simba, peter pan, aladdin and more, all in the same style as the other dolls. The entire area right next to Golden Mickeys was also very well done. However, we were VERY disappointed with the Stich Encounter attraction. This attraction is so small and the wait is so long (over 45 minutes), it is not worth it. Actually we thought the show area was just a pre show area, it was tiny and very poorly done. It is very obvious this attraction was hashed together last minute to address the shortfall of attractions in this park.I seriously hope that HK Disneyland could include more signature disney attractions available in all other parks, namely Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain and Toontown. Every year, the park failed to meet attendance expectation and it says a lot about the quality of this park.Basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to Disney. Grow up and be a real disney park, HK disneyland!",2
"The best thing I can say about this place is that my 2 year old and 4 year old loved it.If you are thrilled by seeing people dressed up as cartoon characters, then by all means go, which probably means you have to be under 7. Aoart from that thrill, it is really quite ordinary. We went on 3 or 4 pretty standard fairground rides, which the kids loved but had to queue for 20 mins or so each time.Main St is not terribly exciting, and dont see why I should pay HK$350 to visit shops. There was a 4 minute car ride which my 2 year old loved as he could steer, but we had to queue for half hour in stinking hot weather for that. Near where we stayed In central Hong Kong, the mall had an underground funfair which was more exciting and had more rides attractions suitable for more ages than Disneyland had, and was a fraction of the price. Personally I think Ocean Park is far more interesting and has a much wider variety of attractions.But if you have to see those plastic cartoon characters, Disneyland is for you. For very young kids only.",2
Since long I read and heard a lot of Walt Disneys great attraction  Disneyland . But it was not being possible for me to view in own eyes visiting USA. Last year it was a great opportunity for me to find the mini or replica of this great theme park built in Hong Kong. It was a day long experience which was tremendous and the rides and live shows were extra ordinary.,2
I went to HK disneyland with my family and found most staff unwilling to greet nor smile. The place was small and you were left without anything to do by 3:00pm. I tried talking to the management in main street who just told me she was busy and to  find someone else to talk to . They were rude and too proud to understand what the real disney is all about. I will not go there ever again...,2
I dodon't know why we came here really. I guess to compare with THE Disneyland. It is not the same somehow the Chinese look alien in this environment and it aidon't US razmatazz. That said everyone was very nice and full of smils so there trying. It is also very small and not so good on the rides.,2
"Disneyland Hong Kong is a tiny, tiny place! If you're used to Disney World, then you will surely be disappointed. The park probably fits in a quarter of Magic Kingdom and it literally took my cousin and I half the day to finish the park. There are not a lot of rides and shows do not run often and frequently clashed. The only good thing about this Disneyland is that you can easily take pictures with your favorite Disney character. My day was certainly brightened when I was able to score a pic with Captain Jack Sparrow (this was when Disney was running Adventureland as Pirateland to promote Pirates III). Also the cute mouse subway that took us to the park was definitely unique too!",2
"We went there last year with our son aged 11, and he enjoyed it without reservation. However I have been to Disney Anaheim, at my wife has been to Anaheim, Florida and France, and we found it a little bit small and tame. If you have kids that are a little older or keen on really wild rides, they're going to be disappointed here. On the other hand smaller children will probably really enjoy it. Apart from the size, standard Disney experience. Ocean Park may be a better bet.",2
"The park is too small and does not have enough rides on the up side the shows are ok and parade was nice. Did not see any people queue jumping, as other people have said go to ocean park it has a greater mix of attractions and is better value for your money.",2
"Disneyland Hong Kong. We have been twice thus far. The first time was in October of 2005 and we have just returned from our second trip there. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel in 2005 and in 2006 as well. The park is a disappointment and the crowds are heavy and the lack of rides is very disappointing. In addition, there are not enough things to do and see! IT IS SO SMALL! We finished all the rides and shows in 1 2 a day! The kids were bored and diddon't even want to go on the rides again! Wow! Very different from Florida and California in the USA. If all you want to do is SHOP and EAT TERRIBLE FOOD then you can come to HK Disney. Save your money and go to the real thing in USA. Also, the Disneyland hotel accomodations are nice, however, it is not as kid friendly as the other theme park hotels. The hotel had some Halloween games and activities that were a flop and it ended up that 2 young men staff at the Disneyland hotel put some games on the tables and then just stood there at the door watching the kids play. In addition, during activities time, the kids were given coloring books and crayons again at the table and told just to color away! No Disney characters....even the storytime was pitiful as the young male staff member merely summarized each page of 1 Pooh book and sent the children away afterwards. They really need to work on the quality of the food at the theme park and hotel as well. BAD! Save your money and go somewhere else!",2
"Having read so much bad publicity I was expecting a very bad Disneyland. So I wasdon't disappointed, but not pleasantly surprised either. I went in the morning and as everyone has said, each queue was at least 1 2 hours long. The fastpass isdon't very useful either. For my first fastpass I could go back within 1 hour but my second fastpass I obtained before 1pm allowed me to take the ride only at 6:30! The rides are mostly boring. There's only 1 rollercoaster ish ride, which is the space mountain. Its quite good but isdon't really THAT exciting. I've tried better at less known themeparks. But objectively its enjoyeable, really.If you (or your kids) like the disney characters, it might be nice to see them walking around or buy the disney merchandise but as I'm not really a fan its no big deal to me.The queue cutting wasdon't that bad. There are some people shamelessly walking past us to get to their friends who booked a place in the queue for them in front but you just have to put your feet down and tell them off. I had this person shamelessly saying  excuse me  when I blocked her way as she was trying to go to the front of the queue but its really not as common as some of the people here make it sound. There are probably such people everywhere, no reason to point fingers at mainlanders and say that they have no social etiquette.Some things that are well done include the 3D animation mickey show, forgot what its name is. Shall not reveal the reason why its so good, the surprise element is part of the fun. The fireworks performance at night is also really amazing.A recommendation   Go in the evening if you have to, the queues have eased up by then so you'll probably complete the same number of rides with less frustration than if you start in the day and spend most of the time in queue. And you wodon't miss the fireworks.",2
"I visited HK Disney quite a while ago (Jan 2006). I was thoroughly disappointed but not enough to write a review. However, after reading so many positive reviews, I felt compelled to write one myself.Good   Not crowded; good layout; wide streets; clean; new; cheap compared to other Disneys in every respect   food, merchandise, tickets; landscaping immaculate; convenient to get to; multiple languages for guests.Bad   SIZE; lack of attractions, especially those that make Disney so fun and have made Disney so famous in America; people cutting in lines; people spitting; people sleeping on benches and bathing in drinking fountains; staff being too timid to do anything about obvious rule breakers.Okay, I am from America and grew up near Disney World in Orlando, Florida. I worked in Guangzhou, China for quite a while including the time of HK Disney's opening. Therefore, I was constantly getting news about the new Disney. Because I grew up near Disney World, Disney's defining characteristic to me is its size. It's huge! Let me list some facts so people can understand.Disney World   30,000 acres; 4 theme parks plus many others like water parks, campgrounds, outdoor parks, etc.; 24 resort hotels not including campgrounds; 99 holes of golf available; employee training center (large office complex); huge area with employee store.HK Disney   350 acres; 1 theme park; 2 resort hotels.Disney World in Orlando is less than 1 4 developed, yet still boasts all of those things. Animal Kingdom, one park, is 500 acres, which is still larger than the entire HK Disney building area. When you enter the Disney property limits, you drive for miles without seeing anything but trees and grass. Their size of the property is astounding. The parks themselves are also huge with too many attractions to finish in one day, especially if lines are long. You can park in one place and travel from park to park by monorail. From Disney's website:  If you wanted to stay in all the guest rooms in all of the hotels and resorts currently open on Walt Disney World property (at a rate of one per night), it would take more than 61 years. HK Disney is based mostly on Magic Kingdom, one of the four theme parks in Walt Disney World. Yet, it is less than half the size of Magic Kingdom. Magic Kingdom has 45 rides. HK Disney 22, and some of those are from other parks such as Animal Kingdom. Worst of all, the rides that are most popular at Magic Kingdom are not even in HK with Space Mountain being the notable exception.For quite some time before going there, I was told HK Disney is small. I was prepared for small. I was not prepared for microscopic. It's like a miniature Magic Kingdom. The castle is 77 feet tall. WDW's is 185 feet tall, over twice as tall. Main St is tiny. When we first arrived, we unknowingly walked from one end of the park to the other not understanding why we coulddon't continue (took about 5 minutes). It was only after looking at the map that we realized we had already reached the end of the park.I do not agree with some of the other members on here that construction was great. I thought many things looked quite cheap. There were also a lot of things in rides that were downscaled quite a bit compared to WDW. Overall, I felt they cut a lot of corners with the park.Space Mountain is much smaller, but might actually be better. Lion King was much different, and also possibly a better show overall.I think the worst yet best thing for me was the Mainlanders. I speak fluent Mandarin and a little Cantonese so I could understand what was going on. The worst was the Mainlanders pushing through lines as if there were no other people there. They would spit, bathe in the drinking fountains, remove shirts and shoes and lounge on benches and sidewalks, spit, stare at peole like me who are obviously foreigners and make comments, etc. They coulddon't figure out how to use the Fastpass machines and caused all kinds of problems in lines everywhere. They argued when they weredon't allowed to cut in front of the legitimate Fastpass holders even though they themselves had no Fastpass. The undertrained staff was too scared to enforce rules for the most part.The best was the HK residents enforcing the rules themselves. At almost every ride, while waiting, an argument would break out between a HK resident and a Mainlander because of something the latter did. It was great to watch and made waiting in line quite fun.I think Disney did a horrible job planning this park. I think Disney was not prepared for the Chinese market and customers and not at all familiar enough with them from the beginning. I think the park misrepresents Disney to those that know nothing of its other parks. There have been countless news stories of administrative problems as well. Disney built its smallest park in one of the most densely populated areas in the world next to the most populous country in the world?!?! I just find it amazing that a company as big as this could make so many mistakes. To me, it all comes down to poor planning and not knowing enough about the local market. Too bad.",2
"Visited this place last Jan 23, 2006. Our all ride fee of USD70w as not worth it! Too small with very few rides for children and especially for adults. I think there were more commercial stores or souvenir shops than the rides you can enjoy. They have to drop the entrance fee by at least half so people can appreciate the place and what they paid for. NOt worth visiting the place at the moment not until they upgrade it very soon. The Ocean park is a lot better theme park to go rather than this place.",2
"The park is small. Tiny small.They say one of their selling points is that it's the first park built yet that is based entirely on the original park, but with an unlimited imagination this is the best they could come up with.There are only a few attractions. Like four major attractions, three show attractions and a handful of childrens rides.The train that goes around the park is not steam powered  it's electric with a smoke machine to create the  steam  coming out of the smokestack, and it only has two stations  Main Street and Fantasyland.In general, the park lacks character, ambiance and friendliness, the ride ops seem untrained and ambivalent, and I was surprised at how cheaply made it all seemed to be. In fact, several of the attractions felt like carnival rides in their queues and execution. The one thing that bothered me the most is that despite Hong Kongs weather (really hot in the summer and fall, cool in the winter and spring) the park seems unable to deal with it in a comfortable way. The queues are, for the most part outdoors, and there are no water misters or fans to deal with the heat. The food is inexpensive, however, and some of it is really good.The Jungle River Cruise is the best attraction in the park from a design sense, and they really tried to give it the detail it deserves. The finale is fantastic. The english version of the ride needs some ride operators who speak english well, because the jokes all fell really flat when there is no sense of timing or a punchline. The cantonese version was fantastic, and the operators were really very funny.Japan is just four hours north by plane, if you need a Disneyland fix, I would recommend Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySeas in Tokyo Bay instead. Until Hong Kong Disneyland gets more of the classic attractions, it is not worth the money.",2
"Obviously I havedon't visited Hong Kong Disneyland myself, but it doesdon't take a genius to deduce from the final attractions list that this ISdon't the Disneyland we all know and love. This park is distinctly lacking in attractions... and lands.There are only 4 actual moving rides: The Jungle Cruise (slow moving boat ride), The Many Adventures of Winnie The Pooh (slow moving dark ride), Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters (slow moving dark ride), and Space Mountain (high speed family coaster). So, not much to do for those craving excitement or thrills.There is no Pirates of the Carribean, no Big Thunder Mountain, no Haunted Mansion, no Indiana Jones Adventure, no Splash Mountain, no Peter Pan's Flight, no It's A Small World, no Star Tours, and no Autopia. Yes, you will find none of these attractions in Hong Kong Disneyland.There's also no Frontierland. What? Yes, Frontierland has been completely obliterated from the park, leaving only 4 lands: Main Street USA, Adventureland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. Great.",2
It is no doubt a legendary place but I just dont think it's worth the money and headache of overcrowding and overpriced everything. Disney continues to raise the price of admission and the crowds are ridiculous every single day. There are plenty of things to do in SoCal that are cheap or free. Save your family hundreds of dollars and go somewhere else. ,2
"My partner and I paid $149 each for tickets to this park as my partner wanted to see the original Disney castle.When paying for the tickets nothing was mentioned about a couple of issues we had.Firstly we walked through and tried to take a photo using a selfie stick to be told we either have to throw it away or take it back to the car or hotel as they are banned. So we had to leave and come back again.Then once we finally got back in we saw countless people with cameras on selfie sticks which was very annoying, but not as annoying as them not pre telling us before paying that the castle isn   t even visible as they are working on it or something. It was just wooden panels with a castle painted on it so we paid full price for partial access and activities to be available to us.We should have been told as we   d have left the park for another LA holiday and not wasted $300.Disney this is unacceptable and a true disappointment The only good thing was out breakfast in the Carnation Cafe where the staff were superb and the Apple cinnamon pancakes to die for.All in all a very expensive disappointing day thanks to Disney not pre advising people at the gate as to what works were or are being carried out.",2
"Dear DisneylandAfter paying $1000USD for tickets for my family. I don   t think I   m being unreasonable to ask for the following. DISNEYLAND CASTLE I couldn   t believe that there wasn   t any notifications to advise you are renovating the castle and it   s currently all covered up. We missed our chance for the iconic photo in front of the castle. WORKING RIDES. we wasted so much time on your broken down rides. We were stuck inside Splash Mountain for 30mins and then escorted out of the canoes, through the attraction and out to the backlot. There was no apology. Indiana Jones broke down 3 times. My husband and daughter were stuck for 45mins and we were turned around twice due to the ride malfunctioning. Haunted Mansion closed as we approached with our fast pass and then we went up to Roger Rabbit in ToonTown only to be told the ride is closed after lining up. Then being part of an angry mob of people who were turned away and having to rejoin the back of the queue when it reopened. PLEASE UPDATE YOUR APP TO ADVISE WHEN RIDES ARE CLOSED!FIX YOUR WIFI Your wifi reminds me of Australia   s NBN, never working and only available in a couple of spots around the place. In 2019, it   s a minimum to offer wifi especially with a large percentage of international travellers. CROWD CONTROL last Thursday, I felt like a sardine. There must be a limit to the number of people who can access this place. It was really unpleasant being squashed in a crowd with young children and aggressive pram pushers. THE GOOD? Fast passes and golden hour. I would have left Disney without these options. Also having the option to go to California Adventure Park. It   s a shame that it   s taken me 44 years to get to Disneyland and although I enjoyed my day, it was Ted the magical experience that I hoped for. ",2
We used to love it at Disneyland but the park is literally just getting busier and busier everytime we go. It ruins the experience. 90 minutes waiting for a 3 minute ride isdon't worth it. I'm not sure there's anything they can do but it wodon't continue to be our go to destination,2
"I   m sad that Disneyland makes you wait in line for Hours to    plead    your case for why your disabled child should get a disability pass. It   s unfair in a very cruel way. They won   t look at your doctors notes. You have to explain,or beg, why your child, should be allowed a pass, Which I kinda get but at the same time, find it very discriminatory. I don   t think they like they way I looked. He didn   t even listen to me. Said he didn   t understand big words, medical terms mean nothing to him, he is not a doctor. He was beyond rude . He was outright mean. I picked a Disney vacation because they cater to families with disabled children. Or at least I thought they did. We were celebrating my daughters last chemo. Which is great and all, but unfortunately because of 28 MONTHS of intense chemo and the high dose steroids to treat blood cancer she has severe osteonecrosis, which we can   t treat because it requires total joint replacement of her ankles, knees and hips, which is not possible during treatment, so we have to wait until her anc comes back with normal numbers and she is healthy enough to undergo such intense surgery. In about 3 months. Until then she lives in intense pain which is ongoing for over a year.  Osteonecrosis is dead bone. My daughters is extremely severe. It   s an extremely painful condition. But that didn   t qualify her for a pass. But a lady standing next to me, her son didn   t like loud noises, he got a pass. I was mind blown. I didn   t even go seeking this out. A cast member, an employee of Disney told me to go do this. To get a DAS pass after seeing her struggle to stand and wince in pain while meeting tinkerbell . The man assessing whether or not my daughter was disabled enough for a pass looked me dead in the eye and asked me why i brought her to Disneyland if she was sick and in pain. What kind of question in that?? I thought it was Disneyland. The happiest place on earth. She has at least 12 major upcoming surgeries, she has been on treatment for cancer for over two years. Why wouldn   t I bring her to Disneyland? We could have went there for a make a wish trip, but she wished something else. She later expressed her desire to have went to Disney and I took her on my own make a wish, and even though Disneyland is actually quite crappy to disabled people. I still got to see her smile and light up at seeing the parade. The joy on her face was contagious at meeting tinkerbell. All in, I   m glad she got to complete her dream of going to Disneyland. She could only do about 3 hours a day, on a 3 day pass. But it   s whatever. We came and saw. We rode 1 ride a day. We wouldn   t dream of ever going back and for that, I   m thankful.",2
Many rides were closed for maintenance. Then other rides shut down while waiting in line. Coulddon't even use the FastPass for one of them (Indiana Jones) because it never re opened. Had to return to Thunder Mountain after already waiting an hour before it broke down the first time. Was able to use the Fastpass from Indy to shorten the wait when we returned. The main iconic castle you see in the pictures is covered with some sort of canvas that has a picture of the castle instead.Not worth the few rides we were able to go on for $129 each!,2
"Broken down rides, unhappy employees, dirty. Definitely not the most magical place on earth I will go to Disney Orlando again in a minute as we   ve been there many times the girls wanted to try something new so we went to California Disney instead so disappointed. Snow White ride malfunctioned and my husband was hit with the cart. Employee didn   t even care just picked up his back pack that was dropped in the process and handed it to him. The ride was closed down due to him being hit though. None of us ever have the want to return to Disneyland again. ",2
"We recently went to Balboa Island on vacation with the family. We also have never been to California but figured since we were so close that visiting Disneyland was a MUST!. We went in February which was off season and everything was just okay. It was so overcrowded. Even being offseason, i cadon't imagine what the busy season looks like or how you could even function.Everyone is packed together and the park is pretty outdated and it shows. For the amount of money Disney brings in and charges they should be ashamed of the condition of the park. Just slapping new paint on old rides and giving it a new name. I know its a type of marketing and branding but the park size is just way to small for the amount of people to go in there.People are rude, My daughter and wife got puked on by some guy getting off a ride at the park. Ive also been to Disney world as we are from the east coast. If you are reading this based on choosing... Go there. its the same cooperate structure but it is far larger and superior as parks go. If I had a choice now i would have gone to knox berry farms instead.",2
"We went on what was said to be their slowest week of the year... I guess everyone else in the world did too. We lined up for 45 minutes just to get in the park. Spent so much money on tickets, and then spent half of the day standing in lines for a 2 minute ride. LOVE the rides, but overall not worth it. 3 different rides broke down while we were in line.",2
"In summary, Disneyland and Disney California Adventure are not worth the price they charge. For starters, the crowds. We went on a Monday and a Wednesday in January, and it was still extremely crowded. For example, just to get into the park, it took me 45 minutes to get through the security bag check (more on this later). By the time we made it into the parks, the lines for most rides were already 60 90 minutes long. We did utilize the Fastpass system, but it is so limited in how it   s used that you will inevitably be spending time in standby lines throughout the day. On Monday, we arrived at 9:15am and left at 5:30pm. We rode 6 rides. For most of the day, the Cars ride was a 120 minute wait. In addition, the food and restaurants are way overpriced. We did the Blue Bayou (their nicest restaurant, which you need to reserve a month ahead of time due to the crowds), and the Galactic Grill (their budget eatery). The Blue Bayou has price tags that would have passed for a very fancy restaurant. However, we weren   t that impressed with the food. We all agreed that we   ve had better food at chain restaurants than Disneyland   s version of an upscale place. And the Galactic Grill was straight up awful. The kids burger, which was $8, was literally a slider sized sandwich that consisted of two flat and bland buns resting on a dry, thin meat patty. My kids were horrified. We had eaten at In N Out the day before (which is cheaper and far superior) and my kids couldn   t get over how awful their Disneyland burger was. For the price of admission that they are charging now, I am convinced that I do not get my money   s worth. Due to the crowds, in order to experience more than a few things, you either have to go multiple days, or purchase a Maxpass, both of which cost even more money, and in my opinion still don   t deliver. If you do end up going, I would strongly recommend bringing your own food and water. Their food is horrible, and very expensive. We did this the second day we went, and it was a much more pleasant experience. This does necessitate that you bring a bag or backpack, which means you will have to go through the security bag check. So I would recommend getting to the park early so that you don   t end up waiting an hour just to get into the ticketing area! We did this the second day too, arriving at 8:15am (the parks open at 9am). It was still mobbed with people, but I was able to get in by 8:50am. Use the Fastpass system as much as you can. You will still end up waiting in line, usually around 10 20 minutes, but it   s much better than 60 90 minutes. The Maxpass would be nice, since it allows you to obtain a Fastpass from your phone as well as have multiple Fastpasses, but it   s an extra $15 per ticket. We just weren   t willing to give any more money to Disney after such a crazy admission price. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the rides definitely are quality rides. They are fun and exciting and tell a story. And the park is very clean. But as I   ve stated multiple times, it just wasn   t worth it in the end. ",2
"I am a Southern California grandmother who remembers going to Disneyland as a child and then later taking my son there when he was a child. Now I am able to take my grandchildren there. Unfortunately, I feel an obligation to tell people  especially people who pay lots of money for travel and accommodations   that Disneyland is not what it used to be. Disneyland is very expensive. And very crowded. And the rides dodon't always work. Last year, I paid over $550.00 to take my son and his family (7 people) to visit the happiest place on earth. We were pretty disappointed because many, many of the rides stopped working throughout the day. I remember the days when ride closures would be announced ahead of time, but these closures were intermittent and seemingly random. We would stand in line for awhile and then be told that the ride had to be taken down for maintenance. In addition, we sometimes had trouble finding a restroom that was open. Three times throughout the day, we were actually turned away from restrooms. For the price that we paid, I really expected more. We havedon't been back since, and dodon't really have a desire to return in the near future. Please, if you are planning to travel a distance, book hotel rooms, and buy multi day tickets think carefully about whether or not you really want to spend all that money on something that is sadly not what it used to be.",2
"We went as a Family of four with two teenagers 15 18, over from New Zealand and thought the park was highly overrated, expensive, crowded, and you get no advantage with a fast pass. If you are coming from New Zealand or Australia don   t waste your time and money, just go to movie world on the Gold Coast as we found that a lot better than either Disney park. Too much hype on the Disney name. ",2
"We went in the heat of summer so we were braced for the heat yet after we had paid for both the Disneyland park hopper we realised that many of the main attractions had broken down. Due to the heat the performers could not parade and the fireworks were also cancelled. We went to the reception at the end of the day and told them about our experience they were all extremely friendly and helpful and offered to give us a season pass or a full refund. I must admit that made the day a lot better. The next day we went to Universal Studios. I would recommend it much more, fun rides, cheaper than Disney, great cooling systems and all the rides were working. ",2
"I have two a 7 and 6 yr old. First week of January and it was busy. If you dodon't live in California, have kids that go to school, and you have not ever been to Disneyland, it's extremely hard to go when this place is not busy! Overall, if you havedon't been to Disneyland go one time when the kids will remember it and spend at least 3 days. And try to avoid doing it 3 straight days if you can, because the kids will not wake up early and stay there until 10pm  that's a long day and lot of money! You would have to plan meals to bring if you want to save. On top of that LONG lines waiting for a one minute ride. Fast track pass, ridiculous, it's a waste of money. You would have to arrive at the park really early to make a good use of it and you'll be lucky to get 3 rides with a fast pass. I honestly do not think it's worth spending your money here. You will have a way enjoyable and relaxing vacation going somewhere else where it's not overly expensive, crowded, and waiting from 70 to 160mins   2.5hrs for a one minute ride! Characters? It's about luck on busy days. You want rides or meet characters? How about shows? No way! Unless you have enough time and money to spend to everything, but you will not do it in less than 3 days. Not the happiest place on earth after 3hrs here. We had good experience in the past when kids were not in school, but now vacation will be planned somewhere worth going. ",2
"The crowds are a cause for safety concerns. We arrived New Year   s Day (which was actually nice) however today January 3rd.... the crowds were so large it was aweful..... The park is decorated extremely nice, especially showing its beauty at night. The average    main    rollercoasters averaged 2 3 hour waits when not using fast pass. Enjoyed most of my trip, but hope not to come back again for 5  years at least.",2
Great rides but lines were just waaay too long. Think Disneyworld is significantly better in that respect.,2
"Do not waste your money. Disneyland is not magic anymore. Expensive, over crowded, poor food ( it is like paying fine dining prices for Macdonalds) Takes forever in lines to go on any ride, and then you realize that you pain hundreds of dollars to stand in a line. ",2
"I have been to Disney World in Florida as a child and now I am well into my adulthood.I still wanted to hit Disnelland for the experience. And now that they own franchises like Star Wars and Marvel, then it seems like more incentive for me to visit, right?Not really.Disneyland is a victim of their own success. It's way too overcrowded and yes, I understand that it's supposed to appease children, but the sheer amount of people pushing baby strollers was ridiculous. I heard that they allow folks to ride electric scooters. That woulddon't be such a bad idea if the walking lanes were not so densely populated. The lines to wait on some of the rides (at least the ones I wanted to ride) were unbearable. So my judgement is based on how much I paid to enter versus what I was actually able to enjoy when I was there. I keep hearing people say you have to go early. So let me get this straight;Instead of being among the thousands, I will be among hundreds that are also early birds?If I showed up right when the gates open, I could probably squeeze in one more ride but it also meant that I had to stay 2 or so more hours at the park to get in that one extra ride. By the time I'm finished that, I'll be among thousands once again.All it means is that I would have to stay there longer and for what you pay, it's not really worth it.Just go if it's something you have to take off your bucket list or if you've never been to any Disney themed park. My guess is that they will eventually have a baby stroller museum and daily contest.",2
"Make this quick. MaxPass it! Schedule the rides. Try to do the early in times as well. Prepare for rude people after 1pm, lots of stroller road rage, try to keep your family safe! next time we know but I think I will wait another year before returning. We will try California adventure this summer.",2
The park really disappointed me! all the rides are for little kids and not for adults at all. we actually upgraded the 97$ tickets (a person) and went to the other park adventure (it costs us 50$ a person). The parade was great and there wasdon't light pardae show.The queue line is busy we waited 80 minutes ! to 1 ride,2
We traveled to California for a 5 night vacation. We purchased a 3 day hopper pass to Disney. We were traveling with our son who is handicapped and our 2 year old daughter. It was very clear the first day we arrived at the park that the staff was very unsure how to help or answer questions we had. We would get conflicting answers and some of the staff was rude. It definitely did NOT have the vibe of    the happiest place on earth!    Very disappointed! Sad to spend that kind of money and feel like it was a waste! ,2
"Hi we are a family from Australia with teens. I have been to The Park three times this will be my last . Tickets are so expensive which I understand as there is a huge upkeep but it   s the way there is no consideration of guests if something is out of order . We got talked into one park pass over two days and the ride we came for the roller coaster in the adventure park broke , we had a fast ticket. I went to customer relations to see if we could do something like come and ride it tmro and it was a flat no. We had a fast ticket the next day to Indiana Jones and they also broke . The guy told us we could come back later no problems . We got sent a multiple ride voucher as a supposed concession so we went on another ride only to find out we couldn   t go back on the Indiana jones as a fast pass . As the tickets are so expensive I think that was a but rough.",2
"Been a few times, but this one was my last. Too many strollers, and now adding too many scooters to the walkways. I hope disney owners have good lawyers to penny up when they let scooter speed and hit people in the parks, or near the gates, I was almost hit by two speeding scooters. Also you cannot walk through without someone, or something hitting your heals and taking off your shoes, so crowded and just disfunctional now. The security asked me what my medication was, like not even airport security would ever ask me that, and when I said the name she looked so satisfied that she was able to be so snoopy to things that are not a risk to the public at all. It also use to be cleaner, not no more with all the pissed off employees that dont get paid enough. I seen staff yelling at a woman for texting and walking, it was disturbing to be yelling at her like that as if he was a policeman. I seen rude staff this time everywhere. Not magical no more.",2
"I realize that most people wodon't care about this review as the magical mystery created from youth will still lead you to go here and by no means do we want you not to go, but a good dose of reality needs to be taken prior and during your visit.While many Disney staff eagerly want your visit to be joyful and memorable, the greed of management has put many responsible for line management woefully unprepared. Fast passes cost money, especially when you purchase the on line app version to make it easier to get around the park and to manage when and where you want to go. We arrived at the park at 9am with a six year old and we knew that you really only get one good hour per year your kid is   giving us 6 hours at the park before she melts. This was our last day of a very expensive investment in Disney (we are Vacation members as well) and we were only able to get a fast pass for the Haunted Mansion for 5:40pm. It was going to be a long day   but she really wanted to go. We stayed at the park all day and when we finally got to the Mansion, we told the staff person we were here for our fast pass and he pointed to a very long line. We said, 'no' we have a fast pass for this attraction and he said   yes   that is the line. There must have been 1000 people in line and when I asked in disbelief how that could be for the fast pass   he said    well, its faster than the other line as the main line was 3 hours at that point  That is poor management and poor customer service. There wadon't any way we were going to wait another 45 minutes with a six year old   let alone consider waiting in the main line. Clearly Disney handed out too many fast passes to make money and in our case took it without us ever having a chance to redeem the pass. We left.We spoke to several other Disney staff and they were as indignant as the others. Fair warning... if you think that the fast pass system will truly make your park experience a skip the line experience   think again. The staff acted tired and overworked and under  Disney ed . This was a very expensive   average experience and we will chose other parks in the future.",2
"I paid how much to stand in a line for hours?!? It took me an hour just to get to the bag inspection. It is wall to wall people, quite literally. I recall decades ago we could check off all the rides in a day and have a blast doing it. Now, we will be lucky to ride 4 or 5 after standing for 75   135 minutes in the hot sun for each ride. I would much rather they tell me tickets are sold out than keep packing people in and making things miserable. Plus, I get the privilege of overpaying for food and drink. $5 for a coke? $4 for a small bag of chips? I will NOT return to this park.",2
A large number of broken rides including the cars ride.  Pay the extra and get the fast pass mobile app to speed up the process and get on more rides quicker.,2
"We visited this park during our 2 week trip to California, we were abit shocked on how much it cost but we thought we are only going here once so we had to do it, I don   t even know where to start, we knew it would be busy but we checked crowd calendar and decided to visit on the    quietest    day, we literally couldn   t move, I expected a busy day but it wasn   t enjoyable at all, all the magic was taken away by people pushing and shoving and us having push chairs rammed into us all day, the queues were beyond a joke, we even had express pass which was pointless as everyone seemed to have the same idea. We queued for jungle cruise for about an hour to get near the front and be told it had broke and to go and visit another attraction, the place has gone to pot, it   s no longer about making people happy and dreams coming true, it   s all about how much money they can bleed from you. A meal itself Cost us around 30 dollars, which was just basic scrambled egg and breakfast potatoes, I don   t know how it   s actually possible for a full family to visit, I feel sorry that people save all year round to go somewhere where you   re basically in a queue to just walk. I will definitely never be visiting this park or probably any other Disney Park again as it   s all about greed now. ",2
"Our recent trip with the family of 9 members included 3 vegans. We found that very few places had decent choices for plant based eating. In fact most of the food was not the healthiest anyway. Disneyland needs to step up and offer better, nutritious eating. ",2
We been there for fun day me and my wife and we was waiting for fantasmic show which is the best experience in Disneyland Then they told us that they cancelled in that day!!!!!!!!! So u have to be sure that the show it showing in your visiting day ... really they spoiled our day ,2
"Crazy packed even on a Tuesday, to the point where you could barely move. Hard to enjoy the experience when you have people walking on your heels or running you over with a stroller. Food was also crazy expensive and mediocre at best. Thankfully we did not have to wait in line long for rides, but I will say the rides are definitely not worth standing in line for more that 30 minutes. Only real positive things I found were that there were some really cool souvenirs (crazy expensive, go figure), and that most of the cast members are super helpful and nice. Special shoutout to the guy at Pizza Planet that cleaned up my boyfriend   s pop spill with a smile and even suggested he go get a refill for free. If you have kids it may be worth going, but if you   re looking to relive your childhood I would stick to a Disney movie marathon. ",2
"Perhaps Disneyland has been oversold as a paradise. Perhaps I'm a grumpy old codger. Perhaps it would have been more fun if I had taken children and I could have watched them be happy. It was unpleasantly hot. It was unpleasantly crowded. The lines were long. Two of the five rides I took broke down and we had to walk out. The last ride I took, Space Mountain, was an exercise in keeping my dinner inside of me. That would have been easier to do had the food at Disneyland been something besides low quality, marginally edible and high priced.So I left earlier than planned, and thus ended up happy. Save your money.",2
"What a shame. Plan for a vacation and spent one hour....Just in line to get into the park. No staff giving directions or info. About 3 4 lines that went all the way out to the street. We   re talking about 2 3 blocks. But, if you do not have anything with you, and they mean nothing. Small bag, not even a large wallet, then you go to a smaller line. I have never seen such lines anywhere, park, attractions or stadiums. Getting cheap on security, guess they do not want to spend money on staff. Save yourself from waisting your morning. Never come early on busy days!!!!!!",2
"Hopefully I can provide some useful information based upon our recent visit to the Disneyland parks in Anaheim.  Admittedly I am not a fan of amusement parks and this is our third Disney experience, with the others in Orlando. My first advise would be to...More",2
"  Crowded too many people   All the restaurants, rides was full with crazy lines   Even the free rest chairs was full no where to sit   Long line to have photo with characters   Don   t got in trap and buy fast pass tickets because even with fast pass you",2
"I   ve been many times to the parks, both in Anaheim and Orlando and as the time goes by, the experience gets worse.At Disneyland Park in Anaheim, my last visit, even when the family spent a nice holidays, the park itself was a poor experience since in my perspective the obsession for profits overcome the visitos   s experience. That is, It   s getting more important to them to make obscene revenues at the time they are forgetting the visitor   s unforgettable and magic experience the park was created for.The restaurants, rides, shops, photo opportunities are sooo overcrowded that you spend most of your magic time standing in line.That insaine amount of visitors impacts in dirty restaurants with napkins and french fries all over the floor and seats, all wet restrooms and constant closure of the rides caused by failures.Some places are torn down, abandoned and useless like the former People Mover and the Carrousel of Progress. Closing the park for a refurbish? Are you completely deranged?The Matterhorn ride is a piece of junk, bolts and nuts fly behind you as you feel loosen and torn wheels and carts.Photo opportunity with a character? Get in a large line and be quick, the former smiling costumed hostess now is a grumpy lady with a radio in a mcdonald   s uniform.Well I could keep writing how different it was 10 or 20 years ago, but the new management are great making profits but they clearely are missing the point.Let me share with you the official mission statement and please tell me where in the world is stated the customer experience, fun, magic moments....Sorry Walt, they made it a cave of thieves!Official statement:   to be one of the world   s leading producers and providers of entertainment and information.

"First bit of advice     book online otherwise you   ll be stuck in a queue to drive into the carpark, you   ll be stuck in a queue to get on the tram to the ticket booths, you   ll be stuck in another queue to get tickets, then another queue to get into the park itself, not to mention the horrific queues to the rides     some over 2 hours long just to do a ride that takes minutes    So booking online means, well, one less queue   Next bit of advice     get there early     though it that could actually mean a toss up between being stuck in the LA traffic and being stuck in the queue into the Disneyland carpark   .OK that   s enough of the queues  they really do ruin the experience for me though    ...On the disabled access front it   s all very accessible     there   s disabled parking   be sure to verbally communicate to the parking staff that you have a Blue Badge  they will recognise this there  otherwise you'll just be waved to normal parking..There   s an accessible tram from the carpark to the actual Park itself, but there   s also an accessible bus option  Mickey Bus  instead of the tram. It   s level all around the park itself.In terms of access to the rides for wheelchair scooter users     here   s the deal     you can book a    Return Time    this means you go to the ride you want to do and you organise a time when you   ll come back and do it which is comparable to the time you would have spent in the queue. You can only have ONE return time active at any one time    We didn   t realise this and went to book a return time on another ride and was then told that was how it worked, by this point we   d been in the park 2 hours and not actually been on a ride so I went slightly ballistic saying something like  this was the worst place I'd ever been to in my life  and the woman very kindly gave us a few    Fast Passes    which give you access to the rides via the exit.That was very nice of her, she also let us onto the ride she was on which was the Peter Pan ride which was way too tame for my 11 and 13 year old but at least we had got on something!We then used a Fast Pass to get on Matterhorn Bobsleds    now I have a disability which means my neck isn   t the greatest and this ride was a bone shaker and I couldn   t wait to get off it! I   m sure it would be fun if you didn   t have any bone issues but it was very much an old, jolting rollercoaster.Space Mountain was a more modern rollercoaster and I had something to lean my head neck on so that was much better and great fun     in fact my children did that one 3 times.Pirates of the Carribean was OK     we   d booked a return time   I wouldn   t say it was worth a 2 hour wait.The boys enjoyed riding cars in Autopia which we went on as it had the shortest queue.And that was the sum total of rides we went on during a 9 hour visit, at a cost of $117 each plus $20 for parking plus $7.99 for one slice of pizza in a horrible    restaurant       I   ll leave you to decide that makes it good value for money but personally it one in a lifetime stuff     not because it was amazing but more because we sort of felt we    should    take the kids.Later in the holiday we found ourselves on The Beach Boardwalk in Santa Cruz   $40 for an all day pass to all the rides, virtually no queues for anything and some thrilling rides     my son went on 12 rides in less than 3 hours there! Crazy by comparison. Make sure you take water bottles  can be refilled for free at fountains , sun cream and have an ice cream in the parlour     probably the highlight of my day apart from the idea of never having to go there again.",2
"This is such a disappointment when compared to Disneyworld. It's much smaller and is more packed in. The lines where crazy, and there is dead ends every where there. The castle looks petite compared to Orlando. Would not recommend or go again. Go to Florida instead. You wodon't be disappointed!",2
"My family spent one day in the park, and in the whole scope of our 12 day trip to California, Disneyland was easily the one thing we all said we wished we haddon't done.It is incredibly crowded, unbelievably overpriced, and uninteresting to say the least.What they did right:1. The park is unbelievably clean. With this many people, I'd have expected it to be a mess. But honestly, it was clean everywhere. Kudos to the maintenance staff.2. The parking and the tram to the park were very easy to use   other than the fact that the parking ramp isdon't marked very well, so it's easy to get turned around. The tram ride was comfortable and fast.What they did wrong:1. The lines for the rides were ridiculous, and very deceptive. We'd walk to a ride and see not many people standing by it, get in line and suddenly the line would turn a corner, or go inside a building and there would be 400 people in front of you. We were there for six hours and rode exactly four rides.2. You better be in your seat an hour and a half ahead of time for the fireworks display. If not, baton waving teenagers will herd you around and around, sending you in different directions while the show is going on. This one really pissed me off. I wanted a picture of me with my family with the castle and the fireworks in the background. We finally found someone willing to take our picture (another visitor), and just as we were getting ready, some knucklehead employee starts waving his baton at us and shouting at us to  keep it moving or leave the park.  No picture. We left the park... never to return.3. We downloaded the Disneyland App, which has a section on it for  Disney Photos    you know, the ones they take of you just as you are screaming down a ride? After coaxing my 14 y.o. daughter to finally go on a  big  ride, we went to check out the photos. The look on my daughter's face in the picture was priceless, and we all had a great laugh about it. I wanted to buy the picture, so I went to the photo booth near the ride and asked to buy it. The employees both told me that the picture would be available on the app in a matter of minutes, so there was no need to buy it unless I wanted them to print it out. I decided that I could print it on my own, and they both assured me that was the best way to do it. We went on our way, and later when I went back on to the app to see the picture, it wasdon't there. So now we have no picture. When someone wants to spend money at your business, it makes sense to let them spend it, not talk them out of it. Dumb.I could go on and on about how commercialized the place is. Everything is for sale. And nothing is cheap. And the rides aredon't exciting. If you want rides, go to Knott's Berry Farm or Six Flags.",2
"Not my first time visiting Disneyland but will be my last. We may have chosen a busy time of year to go but they really do pack way too many people in. It's clearly more about the money for them than providing a good experience for the visitors. Ride waiting times were ridiculous, with some of them around 2 hours. We paid   450 for our family to visit yet only had time for 4 rides in the whole day (and we arrived early). You can always pay more for fast track tickets but we felt we had already paid more than enough. I really dodon't agree with the fast track system anyway   giving priority to those with the most money. If the fast track system wasdon't in place then overall waiting times would be far shorter. Again, it's clearly all about the money for them now. Ride times aside, the place was so busy that it was hard to even walk down the road without bumping into people. Food, drink and merchandise is way overpriced. We all felt completely ripped off by the end of the day and definitely wont be returning.",2
"It's ok. It's really expensive for not that much. You can walk around the park in about an hour. Lines are way too long. The rides are very cool, if you have the patience to wait on the lines. If you dodon't go, you diddon't miss out.",2
Having had an excellent time in Disney Florida a few years ago we were excited to be spending two days here when visiting California.Very disappointed. We left early and we diddon't come back on the second day ... we went to Six Flags Magic Mountain instead.The selection of rides is limited if you are looking for some thrill rides and certainly doesdon't offer the same scope and scale as their park in Florida.Service was great as was the ambiance in the park.... just not recommended if you are with teenagers.,2
"Its Disney, its worth a visit. but we went on a hot day on a Wednesday. midweek thinking it would be less people. I was wrong. there must have been a million people or more. Im not kidding! it was soooo crowded. we only were able to ride some kids rides that only had 40 minute waits. and a couple others because ppl started lining up for the parade. the rest of the rides were 1 hour plus and many were 2 hours or more. if you have the $ and dodon't want to spend the entire day waiting in hot lines with no coverage from the sun get one of the ride passes. this visit was so unsatisfying. It has been 10  years since my last visit and I dodon't think I feel the need to ever go back. they need to limit ticket sales so that you can actually enjoy some rides (but they wont because disney wants the $). they need to put up some sort of sails or something to give people coverage from the sun while waiting. you wait in line to park. you wait in line to go through security. you wait in long line to actually enter the park. you wait in extremely long lines for rides. Essentially you pay to wait in lines! i do have to admit the food services were good. fast service and tasty food. that's it the only positive.",2
"I can   t even believe I just gave a Disney park 2 stars. We absolutely LOVE Disney and are longtime visitors to WDW, however this was our 1st visit to Disneyland. Maybe it was the fact that we went over the 4th of July, but we found the park unbearable after about 1pm. Thank goodness for Maxpass. We knew going in that it was a lot smaller than Magic Kingdom, but holy cow the crowds. The lines for food were crazy. I waited 45 minutes AFTER I ordered at Bengal BBQ. I had already been in line for about 15 minutes just to order, which wasn   t too bad. But to wait 45 min to get the food was unbelievable and then one of our kabobs was raw. In hindsight we should have used mobile ordering. I think the thing that really did it for us were the numerous large families that were blatantly cutting the line. I   m talking 8 12 ppl (no joke) pushing themselves thru or actually unhooking the chains. This happened quite frequently, it was unreal. It made me think this was the norm here. Through out the park, the cast members were a strange mix of extremely friendly and helpful to some that were downright rude, which surprised me. The wifi was spotty and my phone battery drained very quickly using the app. Make sure you have a few portable chargers on you. I   m a huge Disney fan, but I don   t really have much of a desire to return other than to maybe see what we missed. I was pretty disappointed since this was a longtime bucket list kind of thing. We felt like we missed so much of the basic atmosphere because there were just so many people absolutely everywhere. We only had one day in each park, so that was part of the problem. Trying to cram it all in. If I could do it again, I would have gone with 3 day park hoppers. DL in the am and hop over to DCA mid day. DCA was awesome btw, which was another surprise :)",2
"We were excited to travel in to the park and see Aurora's castle. Coming from Disneyworld in Orlando, you have high expectations of Disney. As we turned the corner on Main Street and got our first glimpse of the castle, you left with saying,  that's it??  The trees surrounding the castle were much taller than the castle is, and instead of being in awe (as you are when you first see Cinderella's Castle, you get a better understanding of  It's a Small World.  This isdon't the only big difference between Disneyland and Disneyworld, it doesdon't take long walking around to see, there is no focus on the princesses at all. This park will definitely leave you being thankful that Walt had a much bigger dream in Orlando.",2
"Totally agree with a previous comment, we took our 4 year old granddaughter, had a 4 day pass and only used 2 because she diddon't want to go back again. The lines are horrendous, out dated and so short for the 30 to 90 minute line up. The people are rude and obnoxious. Children wait in the heat while adults with so called fast passes get on kids rides first. We went to universal studio first and our 4 year old had a blast. The rides are 4D, graphics are fantastic and the commentary is brilliant, staff are friendly and helpful, and make sure that you feel welcome.",2
"Been in Orlando and Paris, rides breaking down  on a regular basis .this is are second time and our last , weather great , people great",2
"We visited Disneyland Anaheim resort in June, 2018.  We paid a good price for two adults and one pre teen, the park was not crowded, the parking was done quickly but, most of the main rides were closed.  Disneyland really needs to get it together!!!!",2
"We have been to Disney world several times and have also been on several Disney cruise so when in Anaheim we had to go here. I know it   s the    original    and was pumped after reading reviews. I found it small, old and lacking the Disney magic we experienced with other Disney vacations. I was expecting what we   d encountered previously but that   s not what we got. It was almost like any other amusement park. I   m glad we went for the experience but next time we will be going back to Florida. ",2
"Not very well organised. Hard to find the restrooms. Hard to find bubblers. Very very expensive. Very disappointed, probably because we went to Universal Studios first and they were great! It is nice to go to Disney once but since it is our 4th time we are done.",2
"Came to see the  amazing fireworks  for the 4th. Purchased a twilight pass for 4pm til 12. We were worried it would be too crowded, but got in without any issues. A big tip to those coming on the 4th. Get your spot Early to see 9:30 fireworks. Disney fails to warn you that if you do not get your spot by 7pm. behind a roped in area, you are basically jipped to see the show. Cast members will hurd you along the walkway like cattle, not allowing you to watch the fireworks. We felt a bit mislead, and thought it was kind of a RIP off. For what we spent to be there for the fireworks, you weredon't even allowed to watch them if you weredon't in roped in area. The crowds definitely increased towards the 9:30 showtime. Also, Disneyland is small and Not Disneyworld by any standards. Kind of disappointing.",2
"Though our family has had a few trips to Disneyland in California our last trip was particularly a waste of time. They allow way too many people access to the park at one time, not only making for extremely long lines but near closing of the park, Nearing the fireworks show, the park became so packed simply walking became an issue. One would think this is a fire hazard should anything go wrong during your visit. Now I can see if you went as a couple large crowds may not be an issue but as a family of 6 with small children just moving through the crowd and keeping track of your children is a task in itself. Making enjoying the park unachievable.But as I started off saying.... My family and I have had many trips to this park not all were as bad as the last. My advise.. ENTER AT UR OWN RISK",2
"We were visiting from FL and my wife wanted to see the original Disneyland. So we went on a Monday (thinking less crowded) We went to California adventure first, (thank god). Had a great time there. then went across the way to Disney and experienced a crush of people like I've never seen! Spent most of the afternoon just trying to get from one spot in the park to the next. I'm glad we went so my wife could check it off on the bucket list but we'll stick to the Florida parks where you can actually see the street in front of you.",2
"My last time to visit. To many people, very high cost to attend, $110.00 admission  $4.74 for water  $13.00 for any meal, approximate.  Overworked staff  I know it is Disneyland, but based on my observations, not the most happy place in the world.",2
Overcrowded and oversold. There is no point in putting more people in the park than it's capacity. Long wait times and endless lines. No value for money,2
"We got caught off guard how bureaucratic Disney can be!When we booked the tickets off the app, nothing was said explicitly about selfie stick not allowed into the park. We explained we did not deliberately bring the selfie stick but forgot to remove it from the bag since we came in a rush. We perfectly understood why selfie stick is not allowed in the park.Even better, there was not facility to store the selfie stick and the only options (which were not options to us) were to leave it in the car (which we took Lyft there) or throw it away (drastic!).Yes we so excited to see Mickey and we did not read carefully the 1000 lines of terms and conditions before heading to the park but why not spare some thought for customers to allocate lockers to store the long list of prohibit items, which could be accessed after exiting the park? Why no such option?We saw people smoking and puffing in the park too why they were allowed entry to the park with cigarettes and e cigarettes in their bag??This was a bad start of the day resulted from bad thought process of handling exceptions!We wanted a refund and got directed by security to the ticket booth, waited for 30 mins and the booth staff apologized they could not help since the ticket was booked from the app!",2
We were so looking forward to this visit after growing up as longtime pass holders. Our daughter   s special needs were not accommodated or acknowledged by staff. Ignored by characters... We won   t be back.   Universal Studios really saved our vacation.,2
I love visiting here with my girlfriend but it was ridiculously packed this time about 3 4 hours wait times for each ride. For the price of the ticket it was not that worth it,2
"There is so much I could say about the way the budget cuts and poor cast training is spoiling Walts little park but as a long time returning visitor I will simply address the cuts in cleaning and leave it at saying these cuts apply to the way the place is run as a whole . We first visited in 2004 and coulddon't get over how amazingly well the place was kept , the legendary no litter everything spotless . Now it appears the rivers of America has plastic bottles and popcorn boxes floating around all over ,bins overflow and when folks empty drinks or snack bags they just drop them on the floor . Walt Disneys legendary Disneyland railway train pulls into the station full of litter both on the floor and on the seats . The restrooms that used to be the cleanest I had used now are dirtier than the ones at Heathrow airport (no Mr Iger that is not a compliment)",2
"We were looking forward to our visit to Disneyland. We were highly disappointed. Complete waste of money. Disneyland is nothing like Disney world. We knew it wouldn   t be the same; but we were at least hoping to feel the same magic. We did not. We did not see any characters the whole time we were there. The only thing this park cares about is selling it   s merchandise. Whether it be disney or Star Wars merchandise, it was being pandered everywhere. The park is overcrowded. Ride lines are outrageous. Even with maxpass you wait over two hours. The Pixar parade was a joke. Only 20 minutes long. Food prices are through the roof. Never again will we visit a Disney resort or property. Time to move on to universal studios. ",2
"Oh boy. So crowded. Even on a Wednesday. Lots of rides broken or closed. Wait times ridiculous even using fast pass. Save yourself the peril and pick another destination. Tip if you do go , get there in the early morning 8:00 am. However if you do want to arrive early, stay at the resort, because LA traffic will be prohibitive. You   ll spend more this way. Catch 22! Park is 60 years old and has not expanded much, but attendance has tripled. Our kids 12 and 13 has about 0 fun. Really Disney? For these prices everything should be operational and you should not have time to eat your over priced lunch while waiting in line for a ride that may or may no work by the time you get to starting gate. UUGH",2
"After travelling from Australia to visit my dream theme park, I was sadly disappointed.The crowds are excessive , the wait times on rides excessive(some up to 2 hours) the shows difficult to see due to the masses. The express pass booths are situated in ridiculous spots that correspond to the ride, you think they would be right outside the ride but most aren   t and you waste so much time running around trying to find them. Not being able to check in to a new FASTPASS ride for another hour makes it difficult for you to plan your day.if your an adrenalin junkie and looking for thrills this is NOT the place to come. The rides are mostly directed at kids below the age of about 7. Slow , boring , and mostly same ride over and over again just a different carriage in a different land.BEST RIDE IN DISNEYland: buzz light year Astro BEST RIDE IN DISNEY CALIFORNIA: guardian of galaxy and the speedway race car.TOP TIP: if you don   t want to wait 2hours plus for the speedwY race car in Disney California , than I suggest you get up early go to the park on open and check in your fast passes for your group immediately otherwise FASTPASS for this ride is sold out by 11am. (Ridiculous) if not go single rider , at least you get to ride it then.",2
"Paid extra for the Maxpass, not worth it, the fast pass system is broken, a lot of the time you wait longer then standby",2
"My daughter's knees dislocate and so she was in a wheelchair. The people working the shuttle buses were amazing. The ones running the rides were hit and miss. I had a party of five, three of us big girls and two skinny. At the Teacups and the Haunted Mansion there was no concern about whether my hanicapped daughter and our group made it completely or safely into the seats of the ride. One of us almost got hurt at HM and one of us lost our place to ride at Teacups. So busy we only got on seven rides in 11 hours, only two of the rides eligible for fast passes. Went May 21. Also paid $50 flex for CA Adventures to find false advertising on tv because the Pixar stuff was not done. Overall, felt like Walt is rolling in his frozen tube. The workers were about 75% not caring and 25% amazing. And the difference was that vast. No in between. We also spent well over $1500.",2
"What a let down. After coming all the way from Australia, and spending close to USD$1000 to go for just 2 days, we were disappointed with the original Disneyland, nothing like what you expect. The place is creepy, the rides are average and scary (as in weird, not as in exciting scary) and not great for kids under 10 at all. We were much more impressed the second day with California Adventure Park which is the second part of Disneyland, much more like what we expected, rides were great, not creepy and had more themed sections that kids could relate to. But overall, not overly impresssed. I would recommend California Adventure Park but not original Disneyland. Two stars and not one star only because Adventure Park was good. Otherwise, overrated, way overpriced and original Disneyland was just creepy.",2
Hours wasted only to be told the ride we were waiting on was closing. Experienced this eight times on Memorial Day weekend. One ride failed as we were boarding. Failures in both parks. All for the low low price of 185.00 per day US and six in our party. Do the math. Disney truly needs to get their act together and fix their gear. A Hugh disappointment. ,2
I   m pretty sure Mr Disney would not be a happy bunny if he saw his parks today. I   ve come over 5000 miles and paid through the nose to stand in line at rehashed rides and over pay for any food or beverages. This is smaller than Orlando & has limitations due to the availability of real estate nearby. BUT and this is a huge BUT for the money I paid for a one day 2 park hopper & the amount of profit Disney make they need to limit the parks capacity (that   s both parks). Fast pass is a swizz and you need to plan really well if you still insist on getting one. The only redeeming light is the cast members who make the experience bearable. ,2
We had a four day pass and I was basically done after the second day. The place was crawling with people. I had a scooter to share with my husband and people just kept cutting us off. Line ups galore at each ride. Even the fast passes were 30minute wait. Cars ride was 75min wait with fast pass. I don   t think I   ll return to Disneyland. Once is enough for me.,2
"We had a very disappointing experience at Disneyland. My husband needs an ECV because of heath issues, he cannot walk for long periods at a time. Where you have to rent them is a long walk from where you get off the tram. We get inside and there are strollers everywhere. It is so hard to maneuver around them and if you need to park your ECV.... good luck.....I asked one employee where to park it at the Peter Pan ride and he says  It is a 45 minute wait for the ride.  What?!?!?! I told him... I am aware of that, we are willing to wait, where can my husband park his ECV? He says by the stroller parking. Thankfully, he did find a place. We ate in the French Market area for supper and the whole place was messy. The tables were dirty and ground covered with powdered sugar and trash, while about a dozen people working there had ample time to talk and laugh with each other instead of cleaning up the area. The Jungle Ride was a disaster....we waited for 45 minutes to ride and then the employee goes so fast during the ride, you diddon't have time to look at anything. People were trying to take pictures and finally gave up. Then when the ride is over, we have to wait to get off because the boats are backed up! Hey... why dodon't you go slower during the ride that we waited so long for???? We have been to Disneyworld and it is a much better experience. I was expecting the same from Disneyland and we were left disappointed in our experience. We were thinking about going to Disney's California Adventure, but because of our experience here, we diddon't want to waste more money by having a bad experience. I have always wanted to come to Disneyland and can say that I have been here, but not worth the money to come back.",2
"Disney's decision to practically give away annual passes to locals has ruined Disneyland. It used to be the Happiest Place on Earth. Now, with locals jamming the attractions EVERY day, even mid week on cloudy days during school, there is no longer a  good time to go.  It is aggravating to know that you paid about the same price for a three day pass as the locals paid for a one year pass. Disney needs to increase the annual pass cost to decrease crowd sizes by about 30%. It's just not fair, and it's just not fun with that many people. What used to be a Magic Kingdom is now just an Amusement Park due to the crowds of locals who drop in all the time.",2
"If you want to pay  100$ and spend most of your day lining up, this is your place. We spent 8 hours and only could do 4 rides. A total shame and terrible memory for the kids. We will never be back",2
"Cafe Orleans nice Lobster salad GONE! choices getting worse.let's review a few other dining deaths because they are actually good and Disney does not like to spend money on good food:Lobster Salad...............................Cafe OrleansFrito Misto.................................... Alfresco TerraceCinnomon Rolls.....................,.......Disneyland BakeryCinnomon Roll French Toast..........Carnation CafeMahi mahi Fish Tacos..................Tangaroa Terrace (cheap small shrimp tacos)Nice Breakfast...............................River Belle Terrace now an expensive mediocre restarauntShort Rib Sandwhich ....................Carthay CircleChili Fries with Sour Cream............Smokejumpers GrillBLT flatbread...................................now the Red Rose TaverneFried Green Tomatoes.....................Hungry Bear (you can get them for 5X the price at BB)I'm so sick of Disneyland taking away the good things and replacing with obviously cheaper dining options. If you want us to spend our dollars in the park improve the dining!!!!",2
"Had a 2 day hopper pass 1 park per day.Also had the max pass which I think was about $10 per person.As there were so many people found it hard to use this pass as the rides seemed to be booked out and the app would only let you book 1 ride an hour.The 1 main ride we did book ,which was for early evening broke down and we coulddon't ride it.Got there at about 10am and left at 9pm and only managed to get on 4 rides.My tips for going to Disney would be get there early and make sure you have everything well organised or it will be a waste of money like it was for us.The crowds here are unbelievable.",2
"I have visited Disneyland at least once a year for each of the last ten years. My four day trip that concluded five days ago was the first time I left disappointed. It just wasdon't as much fun and the hospitality was just off. From wrong food orders at in park eateries (on two separate occasions) to poor crowd management to the several rides being  temporarily closed , it just wasdon't a very pleasant experience this time around. Normally, the high priced tickets are easier to accept because they usually give a five star experience to you and your children. The cast members that were there the week of April 23rd just diddon't seem  with it.  They mostly seemed indifferent to the experience we were having and that attitude had not been the case on my previous dozen or so visits. It was supposedly  Pixar Fest.  Aside from a couple posters and a change to the evening fireworks display, there was no way I could tell.I dodon't know if it was because significant portions of the park were under construction (especially California Adventure) or if they were not expecting crowds that big for the post Spring Break pre Summer period or if there is someone new in charge that is not properly motivating the employees. I just dodon't know. What I do know is that, for the first time, I am questioning if the amount of money I spent on this trip was worth it. Especially when you factor in the fact I stayed at the Disneyland Hotel. It is disappointing to think I could have spent a week in Hawaii for the same price and had a better experience.I hope whatever is going on is temporary. It will be truly sad if the park goes the way of most of corporate America; a quick money grab that forgets the customers are the reason it makes any money in the first place.",2
"We were so excited to visit the original Disneyland, but coulddon't have been more disappointed. The overcrowding was unbelievable for an 'off peak' Thursday  i cadon't even begin to imagine a peak day... We managed to get on 3 rides the whole day, the queuing was out of control  going round the sides of rides before you'd even get in the actual 'ride queue'  so people would be pushing in and confused as to what they were even in line for. Kids seemed bored with waiting around, so many smaller children running about seemingly by themselves and in huge crowds this was shocking and worrying, and the amount of oversized strollers wasdon't good  running over toes, banging into people, it was like herding cattle getting out of the park at closing time. Nobody seemed in a good mood after their visit  just stressed. That isdon't magic...The rides we wedon't on were 'ok', but we expected character greetings. After visiting universal studios only days before, the contrast was so extreme. There, everyone was so so friendly and would take time out for pictures, but the characters here would run away from all of that. They seemed on a hugely tight schedule, I saw so many kids unable to have pictures. We managed to get one picture with Goofy, but the 'rushing' staff member accompanying had her finger over the lens so that was a waste... Could use their time more wisely if it is so short?! If you are choosing between Universal or Disney to visit  I cannot recommend Universal enough, but Disney just killed the magic. It seems to be about the money rather than truly caring about the guests having the best experience. Huge disappointment.",2
"Wayyyyyyyy too many people, strollers,  we couldnt even go back into the parking garage because  everywhere around the parking and that ridiculous u turn to get there was sooo backed up.  we ended up going  back to the hotel and hopping on the shuttle",2
"Just spent 4 days here. basically you are spending thousands of dollars to wait in a line to park to wait in another line to get on a tram to wait in a line to get in the park to wait in line all day for anything. all this fun is split up with lots of very overpriced merchandise and mediocre food. There are a few good things, like watching your kids faces when they get to meet a favorite character or when you actually make it on a ride. then when its all done you get to wait in all those same lines again to leave. and dont forget there will be 100 thousand people pushing and shoving the whole time. Do it once if your not a local. way better ways to spend a couple grand in my opinion",2
"My husband and I brought our 3 year old son to Disneyland for a family vacation. We would do anything for him, and at the end of the day(s) I think he enjoyed himself and that is really what matters.That said, what a nightmare this experience turned out to be. Happiest place on Earth? More like Hell on Earth. I   m not sure where to begin. The night before we planned to go, we tried to purchase tickets on the app, but received error messages. We ended up calling some customer service number, and purchasing over the phone. We were told to pick up the tickets at will call. When we got to the park we somehow ended up in the line to actually enter the park, even though we were directed to that line as the    pick up ticket    line. When we realized this, my husband jumped out of line to go find the actual ticket booth. At this point, we   d already been waiting in line for quite a while. I tried to find some shade for my son and I to wait in. I guess we were in the way, and an employee actually asked if she needed to call security. When we finally got tickets, we went to the back of the entrance line. Again. Ok. Whatever. Possibly our mistake for being clueless newbies, even though we were directed to that line.Once we were about to enter, the man who took our tickets also needed to take our picture?? I was not aware pictures were taken, or for what purpose. So I wasn   t really prepared. He practically barked at me to remove my sunglasses. He followed this up by yelling at me that I was in the wrong line for the turnstile the stroller would fit through. Wow. Glad I was wearing my first time to Disneyland pin!Speaking of strollers, these were perhaps some of the crappiest strollers I   ve ever seen with very limited room for storing any items. Small, uncomfortable, dirty. This is Disney, I mean it   s supposed to be family friendly. In my humble opinion, they can do better.Once we were in the park, it really wasn   t much better of a scene. It was crazy crowded. People were bumping into us and the stroller. And I was fearful of hitting people with our stroller. I think I finally understand    packed in like sardines   . The waits for the preschool rides were 30 45 minutes (followed by like 3 minutes of actual ride time), which doesn   t exactly scream kid friendly to me. Thank goodness I was prepared with distractions and ice water. (Ironically, we ran into a    cast member    later, who told us it was a slow day and to imagine ten times more people and waits of 4 8 hours. Ummmmmm where is the magic in that experience?!) Speaking of    cast members   , I could not believe how unhappy so many of the employees looked. If we spoke to a dozen employees over our two day visit, I can think of two that were    bubbly   . The rest apeared tired, grumpy, and uneager to assist. I actually felt guilty for asking the few newbie questions I asked. In addition to this, I heard    cast members    grumbling about    not being scheduled for break   . We encountered more employees (you could tell from the name badges), that we didn   t interact with, and so many just looked ridiculously unhappy. By this point, I couldn   t wait to meet the characters who I was certain would bring the magic. And this brings me to perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole experience. For months we told our son about how he would get to meet the characters. We really played it up. I mean he   s three, so meeting the characters was bound to be the highlight of the trip for him. Over two days, we saw Belle from afar, the evil queen from Snow White from afar and Pluto. Pluto shook my little guy   s hand but was gone before we could get a picture or an autograph. Thank goodness I had booked a character breakfast (for which we were seated 35 minutes after our reserved time) where we    met    Mickey, Minnie, Daisy and Stitch. If I had not, we would have only    met    Pluto. Whoop dee do. My little guy was so disappointed and kept asking where the characters were. At one point I mentioned something to the guy trying to sell us a vacation club membership, and he said there should be two characters    right over there   , but when he went to point, he was like    oh, they   re not there now   . Helpful. He ended up giving us a sticker. A for effort?I knew that our trip would be expensive, and that there would be crowds, and lines. But I honestly expected so much more for the ridiculous amount of money spent, and to be honest, from the name Disney. I guess we simply missed the magic that calls some people back for multiple visits. Before investing your money, and time, in a trip to Disneyland, do your research. I didn   t write this review only to rant. I   m not sure reading a review like this one would have deterred me from a visit, because I visited for the Kiddo, not myself. But after day two, I left feeling only like I   d completed a parenting rite of passage, like I checked something off of a lifelong to do list. I felt no magic, no wonder, no awe. Perhaps just some sadness mixed with disappointment.",2
"My husband had a small soft bouncy ball my son had and was playing with prior to our departure from our resort before we boarded the shuttle to pass time. We took this into the park 3 times before the last time security took it out of my husbands backpack and said we had to    surrender it or take it to the car.    Because we took the shuttle, the car wasn   t an option. The security officer then went on to say that if we were caught in the park with a ball, we could be escorted out of the park. My son was so upset over this. He had just gotten that ball when we arrived in California. Keep in mind Disney sells balls very similar to the one my son brought in, it just didn   t have a mickey face on it. I was told that the reason they allow sales and possession of these same types of balls in the park was because    they   ve been checked over.    My son had not once taken that ball out of my husbands bag. He just had it to play with prior to us arriving to Disneyland. The chamber of commerce cast member did absolutely nothing with my complaint. The only person who truly cared was a cast member named Nina who was working in the guardians area on the night we were there. Thank god she was working, because she gave us a voucher for my son to use to replace the ball that was taken from him. She was kind and sweet and let me vent my frustrations about our experience with Disney. She was wonderful. She was the positive light in our day. When we were leaving the park we were told by the security officers that the    bin    (this is where they put all of the items they confiscate from their guests) is essentially off limits and will not be available for guests nor will they hold the item they take to be picked up at the end of the day. When I asked where they take all of the toys they take from these kids, I was told the trash compactor. Can you believe this??? A billion dollar company not even willing to donate the items they   ve wrongly taken. What is a small bouncy ball going to do Disney? I can see if it was out and being played with or causing disruption. But to take it because it   s considered sporting equipment (they have listed on their prohibited items online things like    helmets, baseball bats, hockey sticks) no where does it say bouncy balls. Come on Disney. Unbelievable. You won   t have to worry about escorting my family out of your park. We won   t be back. Also, half of their rides at California adventure park are being repaired or maintenanced so just be aware of that when you go as well. If a ride breaks down and guests had a fast pass to that ride, they   ll allow them to choose another ride (which is nice but not necessarily fair to the other guests who had a FASTPASS to the line with a ride working) so we waited 35 minutes to get on our fast pass ride. This situation went far beyond the $5 ball. We got my son another one. It   s the principle. We were treated as though we brought in a weapon.. and then told this    weapon    we brought was going in the    bin    and then to the trash with all of the other innocent not harmful items taken from kids. I appreciate security and what they do to keep everyone safe. I truly do. I respect their efforts, however, this was asinine and uncalled for. This was the item security found to be a threat and dangerous enough to get you escorted out of their park. Be on the lookout for these balls when you go and by all means DO NOT bring them to the park unless you want a heartbroken child and it put in the    bin   . They are hazardous and prohibited. Terrifying little thing isn   t it? ",2
Lines are way too long for the quality of ride experience you get. Daily price on a ticket is the same cost as a season pass at a theme park in my state....I   m sure kids think it   s great but probably not for a parents bank account. They really need to figure out the overcrowded feeling you get the entire time. Great pineapple ice cream though. ,2
"We booked knowing it was spring break and lines would be long but looked forward to visiting the original Disneyland. We were blown away at how the Disney has been taken out of this park. It   s pretty close to just your average rundown old amusement park. Bus loads and I mean bus loads of unsupervised and disrespectful teenagers run rampant through the park. We spent several hours between groups in lines for the attractions and watched them ignore every sign to    stay off    etc. These signs acted like a dare to them. So here is the other problem. Fast passes and lines. Once you scan your fast pass the line often parallels the regular line. More than once we saw groups jumping a measly road to skip the regular line. Disney needs to put a second check station in to prevent the line jumpers. Only Space Mountain has this second check and you should have see the kids and even adults getting kicked out of the line. Lines for food, lines for bathrooms, lines for rides, lines for the security check (worse than and longer than the airport). Disney staff so rude that I wonder how they got a job (ok I   d be a little mad after dealing with the teenagers I just described) but tried to give them a bad day break. Glad to say we saw the original again but will go to World for the Disney experience. PS: Fastpass everything you can including all the night shows in all the parks. Sometimes it   s still not the best view but better than no view. ",2
"If you are planning on visiting Disney Land, never ever go during spring break in March, the average waiting time for the rides ranged from 45min to 2 hours all day every day & night. Also several rides were closed due to scheduled maintenance which are mostly done in March as well, but they don   t tell you about it and you still have to pay full price per ticket.",2
Not up to par as far as Disney standards go. Cast members were rude and the Park was overall dirty. The lines were very long(even the fast pass lines). I was with 8 people 5 with disabilities and Disney was not very accommodating at all. It was a lot of money for nothing exciting. Disney World does it right. Spend your time and money there. Disneyland was a joke. When I asked for my money back I was refused. One cast member even referred to disabled people as    those kind of people.    I cant express enough how disappointed everyone was. Will never go back and sorry we went in there in the first place.,2
We booked the 5 day multi park pass and in the past you could scan your ticket for a fast pass at each park. This is not the case anymore. Once you scan your pass for a fast pass your locked out for a max of two hours or the time stamp on your FP whichever comes first. I suggest opting for a one park each day pass and save the extra fee of the multi park pass.,2
"Kids loved the rides.....adults included....... wonderful place.......just too many people in a small area.....fighting crowds all day...... rides were breaking down...... long waits,even with fast pass .didn   t see Mickey too often. If yu did see him, huge lines to get a pix.no parades, no fireworks....not a lot of magical moments... we live in the West...... think it would be worth it to spend extra money n go to Disneyworld .",2
"My other half is a bit of a Disney enthusiast to say the least so she loves it, but I have also enjoyed visiting Disney in Anaheim in the past, as well as Paris and WDW. This time we visited for 2 days and I something about the experience made me snap   I just coulddon't help getting really angry at how much Disney are taking us all for a ride and how the general population seem either oblivious to it or happy to be treated with such contempt. I know it's silly but the thing that got me really thinking about it all was whilst using the rest room. Now I dodon't know about you but I have NEVER seen 1 ply toilet roll used anywhere I've ever been. Even the most awful cheap 1* motels I've had the misfortune of staying in dodon't use it. And yet Disney, somewhere that charges an incredible amount of money to enter, has the cheek to do this. What does it save their shareholders? A few pennies per roll probably. And whilst I was able to deal with the situation by quadruple rolling it up before using, what's a child who's probably never encountered see through toilet roll before going to do? Without getting too graphic, probably make a mess of their hand!After I'd noticed this, I just coulddon't help but notice how much Disney has become a perfect example of corporate greed. At the same time I was shocked to see how the general population seemed to just accept situations and conditions that would be considered unacceptable pretty much anywhere else. It's almost as if people have paid so much money to get in that they are so determined to have a good time and so ignore what's going on. Obviously overcrowding is a major problem, but I would also say that the price of things in the park is the biggest insults to paying guests. For example $1.99   tax for A banana. Really? $2.99   tax for A pickle. I dodon't know how much these things normally cost in the US but a banana would be less than 20p ($0.30) and a pickle probably a little bit less. And $4 for a bottle of water when we all know you can buy one in a supermarket for $0.50 (or half that in Costco or the like!). Why do people put up with it?  Well it's Disney, you expect to pay more.  would be the response from die hard fans. I say a reasonable mark up is fair enough, but the prices for my examples are an insult to guests who have already paid over the odds to get in! Yet there they are   queues of people waiting to hand over their hard earned cash, knowing full well they're being ripped off and almost being grateful for it. My favourite was the queue for Dole Whip in Fantasy Land   no exaggeration there's around a 20 minute queue for people to purchase some whippy icecream and pineapple for $6   tax. Absolutely insane!Me and my partner had the lovely experience of queuing over half an hour for two portions of chicken nuggets and chips in Fantasyland (those plus two drinks in excess of $30) and then having to sit on the floor and eat them as all the seats had been taken.Then there's the queues for the rides. We visited as off season as you can get and yet there were queues of over an hour for childrens story book rides, queues of over two hours for bigger attractions and even a 45 minute queue to GET IN the park. Would anyone pay hundreds of dollars to visit literally anywhere else in America and accept that 45 minutes of your day was spent queuing to get in? I highly doubt it.I could go on, but I think my points above summarise my feelings well. Disney has become a greedy, uncaring Company and whilst at the moment the fans are putting up with it, one by one they will notice what's going on and (I hope) not come back to their parks or their hotels. The addition of Star Wars land next year could be the start of this as this will push the parks to capacity or beyond for several months and this is going to make paying guests miserable. I hope so anyway. I hope that Disneyland starts to see declining guests and a good kicking financially so that it can start going back to what it used to be. I will not be returning, despite my other half's protests! To everyone giving it 5 stars and saying it's magical, get real. I bet you could have a more magical time taking those 100's of $ and spending them elsewhere... they'd go a lot further!",2
"Our family of five decided to purchase the Max Pass for the first time. Once inside the park, our app kept telling us that two of our party were not in the park. This in spite of the fact we had our tickets scanned at the gate and were issued a paper ticket in addition to our digital ticket. We could not get Fast Passes for those two people and had to delete them from our group to be able to get passes for the others. I asked one Disney employee who told me to just delete the two names and re add them and that would fix the problem. It diddon't. I was directed to a Kiosk where another Disney employee spent ten minutes trying to fix the problem then told me I would have to go back to the front gate and have my ticket rescanned. She said this problem happens frequently. (good to know but not helpful) So I walked clear back to the front gate, where a grouchy Disney employee rescanned my ticket but the problem remained. She called for another employee to come and help....ten minutes later that employee called for yet another  techie  who was finally able to fix the problem. When I complained that I had now spent 40 minutes on this issue, keeping me from enjoying the park with my family, he told me to go to the City Hall and they could  do something for me ....that wait was 30 minutes so I just proceeded on to join my family. So not worth the $50 extra for the Max Pass. Only like 5 Fast Passes even available.",2
"Having been to the Disney properties in Orlando, Paris and Tokyo, it was kind of fun to visit the original. They have updated their attractions to include Star Wars and Finding Nemo themed rides. Still the place is showing its 60 years age. It is not nearly as spotlessly clean as other venues as I recall. And there are construction barriers all over the park, especially Main Street. The railroad train that circles the park stalled for hours.",2
"Went with wife and two youngish boys.Firstly very expensive for what we got, basically $400.Charging for car park is a joke, how they do that is beyond me. Lots of renovation going on... numerous rides shut. Still lots of lines despite midweek visit in Feb.Fast pass lines drive you nuts as you wait for 40 mins for a 2 minute ride. Renovation down Main Street meant no fireworks, no parade and apart from Mickey at a distance of 300 feet in a light parade did not see a Disney character all day! Not the magical experience it could or should be!!! I totally understand that the place needs constant updating and maintenance but why overfill park and charge full price even when limited attractions....money and greed of course. Kids were kind of okay about the day but not that special and Disney you let us down I am afraid! ",2
We have been to Disneyland in Anaheim several times and this was the first time encountering so many ride malfunctions. The Cars ride was down for several hours due to maintenance and other rides were cancelled after waiting in line. There is a lot of construction going on and the roller coaster at California Adventure is closed for construction along with the Ferris wheel. Upon entering Disneyland we were disappointed that we couldn   t see the beautiful downtown area and see down the street toward the Castle due to temporary walls put in place for construction. Many rides we never got to enjoy because of the ongoing ride failures. We had a 3 day hopper pass and only used 2 days.,2
"After years of wanting to go to a Disney park it was such a disappointment. We diddon't even spend the whole day there as it was pretty boring. Rides weredon't that great, we saw one character in the park the whole time, the park was mainly just souvenir shops and restaurants at overcharged prices. No fireworks. No parades. Nothing that I imagined at all. The entertainment at the saloon was boring and slapstick and I am a professional performer. Waste of over 200 dollars. Truly disappointed in Disney, it just felt like a money making machine. The runaway train ride which I begrudgingly lined for hours as I knew it was a worse version of a great one we have at Alton towers at about 30 quid for the day! Dodon't even get me started on Space Mountain!",2
There is a lot of construction going on and Main Street was partially closed. Even going in the off season during the week it still seemed really crowded with the center ofMain Street barricaded down the entire length of it. And with it being barricaded there is no Main Street parade. If you are going to go I would recommend going after all the construction is finished. As usual Disneyland is very expensive. ,2
"I am so bummed that our Disneyland trip was sub par. Many parts of the park are closed, including the main st...this is located at the main entrance point of the park and one of the most iconic sections. Large walls lined both sides of the road, forcing patrons to choose which side of main st to walk on. It also caused congestion and took away from the charm of the park. Not to mention the walls were so tall and took up main st from start to finish, you couldn   t even see the Walt Disney statue or castle. Splash Mountain was also closed as they were doing work it. Additionally, parts of Small World and Fantasyland were closed. To be honest you could tell the whole park is going under a revamp. This is something Disney did not explain before going. A part of me feels like we were gipped out of the true experience. I wouldn   t pay to go here until all of the work is complete. I   m sure it will look great in the future but it was very much a let down as I know what the park could offer if all it   s sections were opened. And Disney, if you read this, don   t cheat your customers, let them know about these things ahead of time. ",2
"Love you Disney, but barricades all the way down Main Street made foot traffic a nightmare. The Indiana Jones Adventure broke down as we stood at the turnstiles to board the ride on the morning. It broke down again when we were getting ready to head back for our Fast Pass reservation near the end of the evening. Most of Paradise Pier was under construction and it   s impossible to get a reservation at a restaurant in either park. When you do, they cancel it without notice (see my review on Wine Country Trattoria). In all, for the $150 price of admission completely not worth the headache. Also, you should have left Tower of Terror alone. I love Guardians of the Galaxy and the video component is gray but ToT was very special. Guardians is just ok. ToT was only thing worthwhile about California Adventure.",2
"I kept asking family members if there were things to do at Disney that didn   t revolve around rides. Not really. Most of the rides suck. We were there on a slower day mid week in Feb. The wait times weren   t too long. 20 30 minutes. Even still, we waiting that long to get on to a ride that is really just a parade for a movie that was released years ago. The Park was under construction. I don   t really care about that part. The park was clean and the staff was friendly. The food was not memorable. When it comes time to eat, either bring your lunch from home or go to Downtown Disney. It is a nice perk that they allow you to bring in your own food. We also like they they would give you free water cups with ice upon request. I would be just fine if I didn   t come back to Disneyland. There isn   t anything here that is worth what you pay for. ",2
We thought for $100 each entry we would get to ride all attractions...a couple of rides were closed and a couple broke down during the day...the main strip has maintenance work going on which means no paradesWe hardly saw any characters The lines for rides were huge...too many people and too many strollers and this is quiet season!Food and merchandise is way over priced..almost $5 for a coke that would buy outside for a dollar..i felt ripped off more so than being in the happiest place on earth,2
"Disneyland has always been overpriced but it's fun, I suppose. If we diddon't have kids I probably would never go back because it's such a huge waste of money. The kids who work the rides are friendly for the most part and the food is mediocre. It was insanely crowded the last week of January. I can only guess that was because of the unseasonably hot weather. All in all, overcrowded no matter what time of year, overpriced for what you get, and the food is overpriced and underwhelming. ",2
"Husband & I had very fond memories of previous visits to Disneyland which we had hoped to share with our 3 teenage chn however the excessive number of people let into the park meant HUGE queues for everything (I   m talking 2 3 hour waits for a single ride). Food & drink queues also long. Consequently the whole day became ride centric and we obtained little    magic    that such an experience should afford. Additionally the    fast pass    app was down, however this had only succeeded in getting us one ride more quickly the previous day at Disney California anyway. All disappointed. ",2
"The sparkle has gone out Disney for me. They seem much more interested in relieving you of as much money as possible than delivering a fabulous Family experience The only upside was the Mickey Show at the end of the day, however that cost over $200 for food to get a decent seat Tickets expensive, food & drinks expensive. Rides & entertainment dated. Poor value If the kids are older than 8 I wouldn   t bother. ",2
"My husband and I went with my nephews to Disney at Anaheim. Were a bit disappointed with Disneyland. The rides are old and the park just isn   t as well kept as it used to be. Staff wasn   t overly friendly, no one really smiled, plus we tried to get close to the characters and    sorry Pluto has to take a break, or it   s Mickey   s coffee break   . it was 9:30 a.m. We got on the Nemo   s submarine   absolute fraud!! Unless you enjoy looking at a faded coral and wall covered with bubbles for over 15 minutes with a couple a Nemo animations here and there. Come on, at least you can do better than that!If you take the train ride, the dinosaurs are ok, but there is a lot of debris on the side, construction materials here and there   I mean it   s the Magical World of Disney!Queues are a nightmare and to top it off    after waiting over 40 minutes at the Pirates of Caribbean (this ride is improved) a lady from the staff lets a couple cut in without even asking us if it was ok. Come on, we paid and waited a long time!! I have no idea who they are, but if they are VIPs, then they should use their VIP time not ours. Here   s their photo.Will I recommend it or return...i dodon't think so!",2
Waste of money for seniors. I paid approximately $250 Canadian for 2 days to just sit around watching the stroller. Seniors & people with disabilities should have a reduced rate because I didn   t do anything that was worth the cost.,2
"I expected the park to be busy but not to the extent that i experienced. Bottom line, they let too many people in. Would not go back.",2
"Spent 3 days at Disneyland this year. Jan 14 to 17 th. They offered 20% off ticket price as it was low season and some major attractions were down.(Splash mountain, Haunted mansion, California screamin, Grizzly run, Mickey Ferris wheel). This was fine to me as we knew this before we bought our tickets. Once at the park the lines were 60 to 90 minutes wait as well as space mountain breaking down. Soaring over the world breaking down as well as Radiators springs Racers breaking down.What did I pay for exactly??? Indiana Jones and Pirates of Caribbean? Well Indiana Jones ride the Boulder diddon't work and the time before that we sat in the dark for about 2 minutes before ride started moving again. Disneyland has been my favorite place to go for very many years but no more. Walt Disney would roll over in his grave if he could see what has become of this park.On a positive note knotts Berry farm for one day was cheaper and you get your fair share of rides I without the ridiculous wait time. ",2
"I have been going to Disneyland since I was a kid 50 years ago, so I've seen a few changes. I now live out of state but still visit the park 1 2 times a year, but this year, because of the crazy crowds, ride closures, costs corporate greed, I we've decided to move on. We figured the day after MLK would be ok,...um, no. 3 long lines before we even get into the park! Main Street and the front of the castle have ugly plywood, Mansion and Splah Mntn closed...no reduction in price, but increase in crowds. Perhaps a cap on local passes? The smaller size of Disneyland (compared to World) cadon't handle the crowds at all. its obvious that the Disney  corporates  havedon't experienced  The Happiest Place  like the rest of us.",2
"Disney doesdon't get to not make improvements and have things closed down. There are so many other theme parks that do it better these days. Why do they get to charge what they do and not have to upgrade or enhance the individual rides. These are the same exact rides so themed differently. It's a cart ride through a storybook or a boat ride through a storybook. Why is this acceptable for what they charge? Long lines in the rides that are open and then other major rides like Haunted Mansion and Splash Mountain are closed?? Sorry Disney, I will take Universal over this moving forward ",2
"We had hoped we had picked a less busy time to visit the park, after Jan. 10. Surprise   by midday it was packed, by late afternoon diddon't even feel safe to be there and keep track of 4 kids. Without the Fastpass Program, we would have spent thousands of dollars to be there and would have accomplished very little. Getting there early, which we did, is a must as you can hopefully get in one lineup for a desired ride without using your Fastpass. Visually the sites are amazing, but on Day 2, you want to maximize your ride potential, which is almost impossible given the throngs of people and the long lineups. The parts of the Park we enjoyed the most were the parts that were most empty in the morning. We'd also bought a 3 Day Park Hopper Pass, but discovered the only way to get from one to the other was to go through the main gates again, so suffering lineup fatigue we diddon't do that. We did have high hopes for the one Early Morning Magic Pass Day, but discovered that most of the rides the kids wanted to go on were not operational that early and they were grumpy from being woken up early. Also no fireworks, not sure if that's standard for January or because of the California fires, but it was disappointing. Yes we did have fun, and the kids were amazed, but as a destination when you invest a lot of time and a lot of money it was disappointing.",2
It   s no longer the happiest place in earth but has become the slowest place on earth. Arriving by car you get the pleasure of paying $20 for parking that between the wait getting in the parking structure and fighting the crowd to get in a team takes at least an hour. Most rides take near to an hour to wait or get a fast pass and come back in 2 hours or more. While waiting for the fast pass you can   t get another. If you manage to get on a ride it lasts about 5 minutes. Spend a day there and maybe get on 4 or 5 rides. Not worth the money or time unless you   ve never been there and even then not sure it is.,2
We were here 5 years ago and found this trip very different. Last time there was definitely an atmosphere of a very happy place but this no longer exists. It   s too crowded and you have to wait too long for the rides (even in Winter). Too many strollers motorised rides that you constantly have to watch out for. A couple of the best rides were closed for renovation but overall the park looks old and needs a good revamp overall.,2
"Nice, that   s all I am able to say.I think this Land of Fantasy is in great Disney Magical hands   Dirty, Old, Lack of Sparkle, Long Lines, Over Crowded, Colorless and Flowerless.Also, where are the Disney Characters?? Only Minnie Mouse was found the entire day.My suggestion is: close the park for a while and renovate, restore, and make it what Disney stands for.P.S. The fountain outside the haunted mansion should not only have plain water in it, but it should have red colored water to make it more exciting and true to the haunted mansion style.",2
"The happiest place on earth? Really?They allow TOO MANY people into the park, so many that you cadon't even walk. 3 hour waits for rides seems like very poor management.The thing that really made this particular trip a BAD experience was the bathrooms. A person should not have to clean a toilet so that they can use it, especially after paying TONS of money for the privilege.I found the staff to be particularly brusque. Once again, I paid TONS of money to be there, staff should be polite and professional.If I ever return to Disneyland, it will be against my will.",2
"If your idea of vacation and happiness is spending more time standing in lines then anything else, then Disney is the place to be.",2
"Parking   very hard to figure out and no signs with explanations to where to go ,in addition not all payment both opened so you start with waiting in a car line for 10 min Bus   from parking lot takes you to park, waited in line 35 min to get on the busNo shade ! No water stands no trash bins!!! Bus Drops you off as far as possible from entrance for some strange reason People at line management very unfriendly and pushy Nothing to stimulate kids during wait ( could have a some mascot walk around would make wait easy and fun) Security line   28 min In Total 1 h   15 min from arrival to parking lot until entering the park Lines for the rides average 50 min waitingLines for food court   Averaged 25 min Lines for meeting Mikey   30 minLines for meeting Poh and tiger 30 min and every hour they have a five min brake for snacks Rides and atmosphere are amazing and very special   that makes the trip worth your effort for the kids Disney parade   a m a z i n g !!!! It   s only worth a trip for families with kids that want to endure waiting for the kids to have a good time ",2
"Spent New Year   s eve and it was packed tighter than sardines in a can. Horrendous wait times, outrageous prices for everything. We had to wait up to 25 minutes for the men   s bathroom; women   s bathroom up to 45 minutes.",2
The mouse robbed us. Got on about 3 rides with my family of five after spending hundreds on tickets for the day. They let too many people into the park without regard for whether or not people will be safe or be able to get on rides. That was my first and will be my last time at Disneyland park,2
"me, my daughter and grandkids went to disney on a regular day and there was overcrowded so the handling of the people is done by the employees directing the traffic which are very rude nowadays and yelled at everybody as they push people to be just in one corner to see a show. First of all, disney has to look for a way to handle the crowds with respect and care as before. Second of all, is unsafe to be 500 people in just one little corner in case of an emergency Third, they have to stop giving preference to people who pay for fast passes is not fair for people who can hardly pay for one day ticket to be treated as third class citizen because they did not know that the fast pass tickets had to be bought in advance.",2
Disneyland is always a great time however having a 1 year old in a stroller while it was crazy busy was not a fun experience. There was not much to do for someone that young and while they are sleeping in the stroller you can   t do anything either as I wasn   t allowed to take the stroller into any exhibits or the train. My parents had their first visit though and they loved it. A nice grassy area under a tree would have been great to sit and relax while the baby sleeps but all grassed areas were roped off. It would be great if there were more family friendly areas seeing as it is Disneyland and really meant for families and kids. ,2
"I went with my sister and friend to celebrate our birthdays. First of all I have to say, that the park is very accommodating for people with disabilities. My friend was in a wheel chair and we had no problem getting around. The Cast Members were polite and helpful to direct us where we needed to enter for some of the rides. Other than that, I highly recommend that if you go make sure that you arrive early to get through the security check line. I also recommend leaving the park by 3:00 p.m. because that is when it gets extremely busy. It is almost impossible to even walk anywhere! The wait for rides can be up to 90 minutes and, if you get a fast pass, that wait can still be up to 30 40 minutes BUT if the ride has shut down due to technical difficulties, the fast pass can be almost as long at the regular wait time. For the most part, I enjoyed my visit but it is just too crowded and makes the experience not  the happiest place on earth .",2
"I'm comparing this to FL Disneyworld and there's simply no comparison. The park was dirty and the staff was not engaging at all. I diddon't feel magical here (you will in FL though). The lines were long, signage was terrible, and not enough dining experiences. I did enjoy the Christmas lights and the company of my family, but the park was pretty terrible. I wodon't every return here.",2
"I love Disneyland with all my heart. But was so disappointed with the high priced tickets and THE CROWD. We spent way too much money to stand in line as long as we did for all 4 rides we were able to get on before they closed. There must be a fire law that states how many people can be crammed into one place. We were bumping into people left and right. We work so hard,saved money and was so disappointed to see $500.00 for two days gone like that. We couldn   t wait to leave. Such a disappointment! We got on a total 8 rides in two days. Wow! It   s been years since we   ve been there and we   re so excited only to be so disappointed. Disney is definitely making the bucks. I can   t say I   ll be back anytime soon!",2
"Disney parks have changed since we last visited a US park. The revised Fast Pass pre booking system, along with the sheer numbers allowed through the gates on a single day have made visiting this park an endurance rather than a pleasure, the Disney site still claims that they can reserve the right to refuse admission once maximum numbers have been reached, but I dread to think how crowded it would need to be for that to happen. The old fast pass system of issuing on the day a limited number of passes for each one hour slot worked well   this one does not. Far too many FP  tickets are issued, resulting in stand by queues being hours long   some of the popular rides were filling up with FP riders, only allowing a couple of stand by riders on. Seeing queue times posted of 3 hours, on rides which aredon't new, was a shock. We diddon't visit on a public holiday or in school holidays, so goodness knows how bad it is on peak days. We left before the fireworks (fortunately, you could see the majority of them from our hotel) because people began securing their places for them at 7pm   they were scheduled for 9.45pm, that is how busy it gets. Not a very pleasant experience, and we have been massive Disney fans for many years, that is now under review. ",2
"Fabulous once in a life time trip!!! My 2 girls , their husbands, and my 3 grandchildren. Bought maxpasses for each of us as I wanted memorable photos. We were told that there were photographers throughout the park. We could not find one! So disappointed! Sent an email questioning why and was told to call Disney for a refund. Supervisor told us no.... not refundable. Heartbroken. Please think twice before buying!!!!",2
"It   s not summer vacation or Christmas time but Crowds and Lines are everywhere and the waiting time is over 30mins on average. However, we have to pay full price! The queues in fact reflect a shortage of the facilities and the guests of the park cannot get the service they deserve on time. What upset us the most is the little world is not opened. Yet the shops keep open n give us the impression that the park intends to take money out of the guests    pocket. This is the second time we   ve come but is definitely worse than the first time that was less queues and crowded. ",2
"I think this place has expired its use by date. No longer value for money. Over crowded, no rest areas under shade by rides, $85 lunch family of 4 got a fried shrivelled burger and chips and one drink.No longer has fireworks every night or electric parade. Pay more see less. From NZ 4th and last time visit",2
"Like the previous reviewer, I also found Disney guest services absolutely having no compassion regarding any help for my son who has special needs. Unless you are in a wheelchair they are not interested, shame on them indeed.The Disney care in its guests for people with a disability has disappeared and is very limited and we wodon't be back.The park itself is very old with outdated rides and is stuck in the past and rams people in to the hilt making it very difficult to move around and impossible to get on a ride.Unfortunately it is stuck in a time warp and is well past its heyday and certainly not worth the big bucks you need to pay to get in here.",2
"I have been to Disney Parks (Orlando, Paris, Anaheim) many times and this truly was the worst experience yet. We purchased Park Hopper Tickets. While in the park, one show was cancelled five minutes before it was supposed to start (we waited in line for 30 minutes), rides were closed due to technical difficulties. The food was partially disappointing. And Disney advertised Halloween themed decorations. There wasdon't much of that. I was very disappointed, since I love Halloween and expected Disney to go all out. The Europapark in Rust, Germany does a way better job and Halloween doesdon't have a real tradition in Germany.We wrote a letter of complaint to Disney's customer service, but never heard back. In 2015 our experience was better for the 75th anniversary, but I dodon't think we will be back to the park anytime soon. ",2
"Went there today in near 40 degree heat. The place was completely packed, and in certain areas, like New Orleans, it was almost impossible to move for people and prams. My initial euphoria at being there quickly wore off with average queue times an hour or more and almost no shade. It was like torture. Fast pass means the main queues move much more slowly. In the end I managed two rides. A third broke as I neared the front of the queue. It really diddon't feel special or magical at all, and I have to say when I read other recent reviews I wonder if we were at the same place and how many are paid for. I dodon't consider a hundred dollars and hours of queuing to be value for money or special. I coulddon't be bothered to queue for food so cadon't comment on that as I gave up after less than four hours. I will say Disney need to limit the number of people in the park and put up canopies on queue lines for their rides. I'm surprised no one has been seriously hurt by heat stroke or worse. I've seen it, so it's something off my wish list, but I coulddon't help but feeling I was being royally shafted by Disney, who could do way more to make it a better place. And they aidon't exactly short of cash and looking for change down the back of the sofa are they.",2
"Over Priced Over Crowed,Under whelming Under performing !!Way $$Expensive with Crappy overpriced gifts,little of 'Free' performances  All rides take at least an hour to get on and 'Future Land' mose well be called 'Star Wars 1977' !!Absolutely a waste of time and PLENTY of places to spend a $700   Dollars else where ...UGH !!!!",2
"I've most likely been to a Disney park for the last time. It was clean, attractions are attractions, waiting in 50 to 90 minute lines the normal. What I did notice was that the personnel, especially running the attractions were about 50% of them were not watching the patrons, were not assisting the patrons, just talking with co workers or daydreaming. It was disappointing from a safety perspective. I'm sure there are many first timers wondering if they are doing the right thing at the right time. Something has changed, and from my perspective not for the better.",2
"We tried to bring a collapsable foot stool for my 90 yr old mother in through security, only to be stopped at security and have it taken away. We would have put it in a locker if they were available, but they are inside the park.on our way out we saw it was still there and my husband asked to have our property returned to us. After talking to three people they said NO! The reason, because the person was not on duty when we came in so they cadon't give it to us. How ridiculous. I feel they stole it, and need to return it. We are season pass holders and will not renew them. So much for the happiest place on earth.",2
"Perhaps visiting on a halloween special day affected this but after visiting Disneyworld in Florida a few times I was excited to try the California park. I was disappointed. Everything was cramped, the way the queues were set up was bizarre, with Matterhorn in particular just sending us round in circles trying to find the end of the queue! A lot of the big rides weredon't even working.The staff seemed bored and uninterested, whereas at Disneyworld they are very much actors in character and not staff   that difference was very obvious.We visited Califonria Adventure next door too which was much better   save your money and just visit there instead.",2
"As an elder couple (early 60s) we were really not sure what to expect however we did not expect the crowds nor the closed rides. A few of the best rides were closed, the Haunted Mansion, Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean (until around 7 pm), Splash Mountain from around 5 pm. We waited for 2 hours to go to splash mountain only to be told it was closed for  technical reasons . To pay $100 US each for the day we feel like it was a rip off. The next day we went to Disney California which was marginally better. Apparently we were not there during the busy season, but refuse to wait 1 hour 15 minutes on a queue. At least at Disney California they provide shade mostly while waiting. ",2
"I wish I had time to write a detailed review here but I wanted to get this online.35 degrees C all week and very little shade anywhere at the park! I'm 47 and in good shape, I cadon't imagine how others deal with this and why Disney cares so little about their patrons that they dodon't worry about providing shade. Unless you happen to be standing, waiting for a ride that is inside one of the buildings Disney doesdon't worry about putting up covers anywhere and certainly doesdon't provide misters or cool zones like they do at Universal. WHY??? I'm glad they provide lots of drinking fountains but if you are not a fan of standing or walking around in the sun without relief you better be prepared as Disneyland is a difficult place to get out of the sun, especially at Toon Town and Fantasy Land.Hope this heads up helps some unsuspecting person be better prepared for what to expect in the summer.",2
"My partner and I visited Disneyland Park as we figured it would be a great day out in LA regardless of age! The park is dated and definitely geared towards children. Lots of shows and children's rides but not much for adults. Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain and Haunted Mansion were all closed for repairs, and I'd known this before I woulddon't have gone in. Indian Jones and Splash Mountain had 60  minute wait times. All in all my partner and I spent just over 1 hour there; it felt like a total waste of almost $100 per person and we will never go again. ",2
"I do have an annual pass, but Disneyland is not the Disneyland of my youth, not even of my own kids youth. It is way too commercialized and I witnessed a case of racial profiling while I was in one of the stores. No apologies from ANY Disney  cast member  for their error in judgement AND then they were told they were  trespassing . Not sure, but if you accept my money to  trespass  on your property, that is more like an  invite  with a welcome because...you took my money",2
"Everything makes us happy in the happiest place on earth except for water. 3 dollars and 75 cents for a 20 Oz or 500 ml bottle of water. There are very few drinking water fountains and each of them far away from one another. The fountains are also not hygenic as people put their open mouth on top of the outlet and we cadon't also use refillable bottles in a fountain. Only thing that's available every 20 feet is the bottled water. Consider the hot summer days(or any day in South California is warm) and we had to buy 10 of these for 2 adults in a day's visit to the park. Disneyland can bring in the water vending machines that distill tap water on the spot plus chilling it and also comes with options to refill water by paying 25 cents per 500ml for example or even less. Cost effective, hygenic, healthy for family and kids and also environmentaly green since it encourages to use refillable bottles and avoids landfill",2
"My two daughters waited to get jack sparrows autograph over by the blue bayou we asked the lady who was walking with him if he dose autographs she said yes if you ask nicely my 6 and 8 year old asked please 3 different times, he then told them if they diddon't want to take a picture they needed to shoe them started a count down from 5 ..... my daughter ran to me crying saying how mean he was, I understand the need to play the roll of a a hole but to treat kids in that manner is just wrong. All the other characters were very nice and wonderful. ",2
I dream of coming to Disneyland since I was little. I never had a chance until now and it was way too pricey and way too crowded. I even got the fast past but it's still at least 1 hour wait for certain attractions. I think my dream died a little because it's not as magical for adults!! LOL ,2
"I went to Disneyland with my daughter about a week ago. I'd been working hard, and been squeezing in places to visit on my days off, and Disneyland was a top priority. I've always loved this place, being an older adult, and having been since I was a child, my daughter was a child, we are both adults and we longed to experience the 'Happiest place on Earth' once more. I was never so disappointed.Extremely long lines, with no relief in sight except for that God awful 'Fastpass' feature. They really need to get rid of that and fast. You have to hold on to your admission ticket all day, insert it into this machine on the ride of your choice, only to have to return to it over an hour or two later to 'supposedly' get front of the line benefits. How is this 'fast' when you have to return over an hour later?You can only get one fast pass at a time, meaning no two times can overlap. So this leaves you walking around, rather aimlessly, buying things you really diddon't want, just to kill some time. (Smart move Disney).It gets rather boring and tiresome walking around, waiting for a ride that's only 3 5 minutes long. We went to Toontown only to NOT see Mickey. He was apparently busy 'filming'. The line to see Minnie was wrapped around her house. Again, we found ourselves buying things we really diddon't want just to fill space while waiting for our Fastpasses to kick in. So our time finally came to ride Space Mountain, yeah! We were in line, almost there when....it broke down! NOOOO!!!!!! They told us it would be an hour before anyone else could ride it...........I was soooo mad.We went to the classic ride, Pirates of the Carribbean. I was so stolked! We were in line, and (wait for it) it broke down! NOOOO!!! About 100 riders, trapped on boats. I wanted to ride it so bad my daughter and I decided to wait it out. A few people chose to leave. After about 30 minutes, yep 30, it was up and running again. We got on.All the water rides were about a two hour wait, so we passed those entirely. The Matterhorn was by far, the most bumpiest ride I've ever ridden. I dodon't remember it being that bumpy. The only highlight was the burger I had for lunch dinner. It was de lish! Very well done and flavorful. But overall, my experience at Disney was very lackluster. It's not what it used to be. It's become a very hip 'Tourist only' spot, that gauges into your pockets to spend wayyy more than you really should. I just diddon't feel like a 'kid again' like I used to when I go. I felt like an adult, who went to an amusement park, spent a lot of money, rode half of the rides due to long wait times, and just had an average time. I bought a Mickey plush, to remember my last time going to Disneyland.If you really wanna have a good time, go to Universal Studios. Buy a 'Front of the line Pass'. You'll never wait, straight to the ride show you go! We saw every attraction in about 5 hours. And, the attractions are far newer, and better. Sorry Disney.",2
"We did spend all day there and my kids enjoyed it but the park feels outdated compared to universal studios. I know it is a family park but the riders are not reliable at all. The space mountain was closed for refurbishment and three other main rides were temporally closed (thunder Mountain, pirate of carbean and indianer Jones) For that price that is not acceptable. Food was ok and queue was not too long although we had a fast pass",2
For a company as sophisticated as Walt Disney you would think they could get better service. It's really bad.,2
I am sure that it has been said before but queues of two hours for the main rides is just not acceptable. Not for the amount of money that park entrance costs for a family of five.We stayed from 8am to 10pm and still failed to get on some of the big rides. They just have to have a maximum capacity for the park.All in all really cheesed off.,2
Disney used to be a great place to go visit with kids. I dodon't know what has changed but we were recently there and it was terribly crowded the last few years. Disney World seems to be better organized but it still crazy to spend the money you do to only get to go to a handful or less of rides per visit. I was extremely disappointed in Disney Adventure Land. There were no fast passes available after a certain point. We arrived late to the park and only got to 2 rides. Wait times were 1 2 hours. Standing around with children for that long is not easy. If you venture here be prepared for the crowds.,2
"So I have never written one of these reviews before, joined trip advisor just so that I could leave this review. Let me also say that we are lucky enough to be a well travelled family that between us have been to theme parks all over the world at the height of Summer, (including Disney in Paris and Disney in Florida) so we have very realistic expectations of how busy these parks can be. However, nothing could have prepared us for the sheer volume of people in the first park, the original Disney Land. We knew we were coming to a smaller park and that the attractions might have seen better days, but that turned out to be fine. The staff were lovely and friendly as always, the place was clean and the rides were fine (except 'its a small world' which is a shocker and should be closed...dreadful racial stereotyping of THE WORST kind!!)We had a two day pass and spent the first day in the original park. The volume of people was obscene; you literally coulddon't move. Even with the fast pass we were lined up for 45 50 minutes for some rides. We also diddon't realise that the fast past system was used for some of the 'shows', so we did not see the water lights show at the original park as all the passes were gone very early in the morning and the staff were very clear that without one of the fast pass seats there would be no view. If you diddon't start sitting for the parade over an hour before hand, no way you were getting a view. You were carried along by a sea of people and at times it felt really unsafe. I am sure Disney will say they manage the crowds well and that we were really safe, but it diddon't feel that way. For the evening fireworks we were herded (and I mean that) into a so called viewing area   it was worse than the Jubilee line at rush hour, we were rammed in, standing room only, pressed up against others, kids crying, people getting grumpy...not the 'happiest place in the world' for sure!! (and this was a good hour before the fireworks were due to start). Then when the fireworks went off, they were all hidden behind a tree!! So top tip...if you want to watch the fireworks there, you need to be directly in front of the castle. Even a bit over to the left (as you look at the castle) and you can forget it.The issue clearly comes down to one thing...greed. There are simply too many people allowed into the park, it was awful. We went to the California park the next day and this was much closer to our previous experience of Disney, busy but manageable and all round way more enjoyable.So if you are planning to take your kids to Disney, my advice is save your money and go to Florida. If you must go the the one in Anaheim, just get a one day pass to the California park, we saw more of Minnie and Mickey there anyway!!Not a great experience!! Bad show Disney!!",2
"Us, a family of 5 from Texas visited on 7 20. This was my kid's (16, 14 and 12) first trip and wife and my return trip since the 80's 90's. We visited the main park (not CA adventure), and it was very crowded, with wait times of 60 mins to 90 minutes for each ride. We diddon't purchase the fast pass, but from what I could see, the fast pass let you come back to the ride at a  scheduled  time to skip the long line. The  scheduled  time was an hour or so later and at least for one of the rides, the fast pass was not available for holders to use (Nemo's adventure). The day we went it was very hot and most lines were in the sun light   the fact that there were no mist cooling stations was strange (the other LA area amusement park has these). I diddon't feel the rides were worth the wait times and none of us enjoyed the park. If you go to the park, skip the Nemo ride   it's faux fish and a Nemo short movie that will leave you wondering why you waited 60 minutes to see it.",2
"I will start by stating that I am not really Disney fan and this was my first visit at any of their theme parks in my life since my wife really wanted to take the kids. If going into it you know you will stand in line on average of 30 to 60 minutes that would be good to know   this also includes getting food or going to the washroom. The sheer volume of people they allow in the park is overwhelming and seems like nearly every experience you need to pay extra or wait in line for long periods of time. Some of the rides are fun   Star Wars and Space Mountain as an example   and getting in with fast pass helps but basically felt like a cattle being herded all day from one line to another and every where you turn someone is trying to up sale you on something. The amount of waste this park must produce to me is also appalling   only recycling stream is for coke product and everything else goes to landfills. It is very clear they are in the business of making money and are very good at it but personally. For a family of 4 with two kids ages 4 and 6 we spent over $1,000 which is more than any one day activity I have ever spent...first time at their theme park and hope to never have to go again.",2
"It was always magical and enchanting but waiting for longer than 2  hours for some rides with NO protection for the sun is not. There is no protection from the sun anywhere, no shaded places, no where to sit under an umbrella or similar. In fact, no were to sit and rest, period. Food and drinks (very little of it) is awfully expensive (and not good) and you are not permitted to bring your own. Disneyland is behind times; there are NO places to recharge your phone or devices anywhere even though the map shows a single location but when you get there you are not allowed to enter or charge. If you find an outlet somewhere to plug in by a miracle, staff barks at you and kicks you out! Totally behind times and NOT an  entertainment  park anymore. Just a money sucking, wasted time in line, no were to sit park! So different from before and so behind times and comfort for the public! We are truly disappointed! This will be our last visit !!",2
"My daughter and I and grandchildren age 14 and 10 visited Disneyland June 2017. It had been a few years since we have been there since we live in Reno, Nevada. The park is run down and hugely overpriced. We paid $52 for 4 hot dogs and 4 sodas in the park. Not many places to take a rest as the benches have all been removed. We were on Alice In Wonderland ride at 10:30 pm the ride broke we were stuck 1 2 hour and were walked out by attendants. The Haunted Mansion ride broke down while we were on it for 1 2 hour. The rides took over an hour each waiting in line and you can only fast pass once every so many hours. The Disney Characters are NO WHERE to be seen. .And when you do they are out only 20 minutes then whisked off and you are told not to bother them. The Electric Light Parade is the only time you catch a glimpse of Mickey Mouse or Cinderella or any of them. The park is run down compared to a few years ago. Many of the rides were broken or broke down while people were on them. We were so disappointed with Disneyland. The gift shops have almost NOTHING that says the actual words DISNEYLAND. A very few t shirts and key chains and that's it! The advertisements all depict the SUMMER OF HEROES what a crock of crap. Nothing there is the Summer of Heroes. The music as you enter the park is not the original Disney theme. It is some sort of Jazz or something and that was so disappointing. As you leave the park at night many homeless living on the streets surrounding the park and you must walk through them. Walt Disney in his own words said he Never wanted Disneyland to get so expensive that normal everyday working class coulddon't afford it,, well he certainly would not like the horrible way his park is being taken care of today. Such a shame. It is not longer the Happiest Place on Earth we will never go back there. The plants and rides were really run down.. Very sad.",2
"Went to Disneyland with my family and a few friends and their families. Sad to say that we went on the wrong date! Fourth of July! I was extremely excited because it was my step daughter's first time. We did take advantage of the fast passes which was cool. The horrible experience came towards the end of the night. I wasdon't aware you had to camp out at your spot for the parade 2 4 hours before. (how can you enjoy the park and get a good spot) We were down at around the castle area an hour before the parade and we kept getting told we had to move. We literally made our way from the castle to the entrance of the park. There again, we were told we all had to move....Seriously? If it's 4th of July and the park is overly at capacity how and where could we enjoy the parade and the special firework show? We ended up being told to keep it moving. We did. We found a spot by a spaceship ride. The whole gang got on the ride and I stayed behind. When they got off the ride shut down to get ready for the parade to start. There was a RUDE young lady named Raquel and others (she stuck out because of her ugly attitude) They were yelling for us all to move. There were TONS of people everywhere and we coulddon't move. I asked her  Where can we stand because we've gotten moved 3 times  She replied and said,  IDK find somewhere, it's not my fault you diddon't save a spot for 2 3 hours  I said,  Really? I paid a good amount of money like everyone else here and was not aware we had to do that  I asked for her name and she literally took her name tag off and said,  Here tell them my name  We exchanged back and forth and I walked away. FIRST and foremost, I had been trying to be patient this whole time with them moving us all around, however, is this Disney's NEW STANDARD of treating their guests????? I HAVE NEVER, EVER gone to a theme park and met a rude employee like that one. EVER! I visited Disney World plenty of time as well and NOT ONCE was anyone ever rude. She really dampened my mood and my family's mood as well. We were literally moved all the way towards the Space Mountain and we missed the firework show. I WILL NEVER VISIT THIS PLACE AGAIN! Disney World and California Adventure will be the only places we ever spend our money again!",2
Pick another spot unless you have $500 bucks to spend on a family of four just to get in the door. Those of us who visited this park in the old days long for the great value it brought. These days Disneyland is run by a corporation that puts together a great product at an unreasonable price. But people continue to go in droves. I wish folks would stop going here so that the park would stop going up in price each year. There are other places to spend your money. I for one refuse to leave my hard earned paycheck there. They are just too greedy,2
We had cast members rude to us over simple questions more than 1 time per day. Rides were inefficiently managed with 4 or more seats in a row going unfilled on rides despite lines for rides. Cast members spending time hanging out with each other instead of paying attention to customers and their job. Very few employees had that Disney upbeat spirit we've grown to love at Disney World. Very disappointing experience. I like grumpy but not in staff members. Just seemed like it was hard to find a cast member that wanted to be there. Disney World in Florida is the exact opposite in customer service. It's the happiest place on earth at Disney World and a very average place at Disneyland.,2
Some sort of accurate indication of wait time is needed. 45 to 60 minutes is too long for what turns out to be a 3 to 5 minute ride. It needs more stuff you can see from the outside and staff need a better attitude,2
I took me forty years to get back to Disney to come back to 3 of the majors rides being down.  Really?  After I pay all that money I had to leave so disappointed!!!!!  I drove 15 hour for this!!!!,2
"Having visited Disneyworld in Florida several times we thought we would try Disneyland whilst in California.We found the whole experience rather underwhelming ,rides closed ,rides breaking down whilst on them, and some long waits even for fast pass.The electric parade and late night fireworks were very good, but we think that the admission prices are far to high for this theme park.,Walt Disney world not be impressed ! This might be the original Disney but it falls way short of the Disneyworld Florida.",2
"As a Disney fanatic, I was thrilled to finally see the original. I was disappointed. The castle and park overall is small. The park sells too many tickets so all of the lines are long  60 minutes was typical. Waiting in the outside queue that long was miserable. There are not any photo pass photographers except one in front of the castle. It was not worth the one say fee.",2
"We found this place to be a real disappointment. It is Disney's oldest park and is clearly showing its age. Not that many rides, with big queues for them all. Lots of shops selling overpriced Disney merchandise. It seems a shame that they want to fleece you in the shops when the entry fee is so expensive. Having said that it is very popular with lots of locals, with many people clearly enjoying repeat visits and happy to pay for Disney clothes, mouse ears etc etc. It just wasdon't our cup of tea. (We are British and probably dodon't have the same emotional attachment to Disney that some Americans do). ",2
"We went on Friday 19 May and it was absolute crap! Crowds were over the top! We had to compete with grads and the locals that had only till the 25 May to use their discounted entry! Paid a huge amount of money to stand in lines. And with a 13, 10 (who is autistic) and 8 yr old this is NOT magical! We travelled all the way from Australia to fight crowds. Worst experience of our lives. I felt terrible complaining to them but I had to. When you spend the previous 8 mths hyping your kids (and husband) up to go and spending the amount of a small car to go here you expect more. We come from a small city in Qld and it felt like our whole population was there. We found out later that it was! We tried again on Tuesday 23 May and weds 24 May and these days were still as crowded. Even locals were saying it was like terror land. Our 8 year old said 'it is definitely not magical' will not be going back anytime soon.",2
"The park was beautiful and the employees were kind and extremely organized. However, the kids rides there are NOT for young kids. Extremely scary and I'm really shocked that they havedon't gotten in trouble for allowing young children on rides that are seriously evil. Avoid all the rides that go inside the buildings. They are NOT suitable for young kids, or anyone for that matter. ",2
We went on a Thursday in May thinking it woulddon't be that busy. The park was so crowded that it was difficult to even walk around with our double stroller. A few days later we saw an article saying the park was at capacity and they weredon't letting anyone else in. ,2
"I have been going to Disneyland for 54 years. Sometimes multiple trips per year. The last few trips have been terrible due solely to the change in number of park admissions allowed by Di$ney. They are now filling the park 25 35,000 beyond comfortable capacity in search of even more revenue. Wait times for peak attractions were 3  yes THREE  hours this past weekend. Maybe even worse during the holiday season especially between Christmas and New Year's. I have asked in years gone by and they stopped letting people in at about 50 55,000 guests. That number has been upped to 80 85,000 in Disneyland with another 30 35,000 at Disney's California Adventure who can park hop adding even more to the overcrowding. There were no smiling adults or small children. The teens were oblivious and on their phones all the time. You could barely walk in some areas. Wait time for Splash Mountain  WITH A FAST PASS  was 25 minutes. There were waiting lines for the bathrooms!!! Greed has supplanted customer experience at Disney. There is no longer any regard for whether you have fun or not. And the costs are above premium to boot. If you must go plan a trip in April or October mid week. Then you can at least have room to move and breathe. Horrible experience now four times in a row. That's the price you pay with school age kids, but made worse by intentional overcrowding by Disney. ",2
"I love Disney. I know that other people love Disney. I have visited Disney in Paris and Florida, I know what to expect. Californian Disney is RIDICULOUS. Over $500 for 2 adults for ONE DAY, out of season, not in Easter or a holiday or anything. We queued for ages to get on anything, we coulddon't even walk around easily there were that many people there, many attractions had queues of well over 2 hours   I cadon't even imagine taking kids there. I feel that it was over what is a reasonable  capacity  in terms of having a good experience there, as we only got on a few rides, despite spending all day there and arriving before 8am.I woulddon't go back OR recommend.",2
"To start with, the park was too crowded, mostly with chinese and spanish speakingvisitors. At some places, you could not even walk due to the immense number ofpeople. Many of the rides are also too basic and childish. I know this park ismeant to attract children, but come on, so childish !! I have visited it twice inthe past 17 years, and this visit was probably the last. They even rip you offfor food and beverages. The prices are 3 4 times of what you would get them outside. I think Disney as a group has become too greedy. The 2 parades are mediocre as compared to earlier.",2
"Disneyland is definitely a slave to Wall Street these days. We have been several times over the last few years and it seems to be getting worse every time. The service is getting worse (many dirty bathrooms, empty towel dispensers) and the wait times are getting longer. They are packing more people in to rake in those dollars, but not investing where they need to in order to keep the traditional Disney experience untarnished. More training is needed to help with crowd control and admission (I spent an hour between security and the line to get in to the park on a Monday in early May). The park tries to offset the long lines at attractions by overcrowding the rides, which just makes for a bad ride experience. On the Pirates of the Caribbean, we were stacked up bumper to bumper 5 boats deep, with boats continually crashing into each other   and this was the second week of May (not a busy time historically). The same thing was happening on all of the boat based rides. It was insane. On other rides, it was the same story, they would run additional cars that would stack up at the end of the ride while waiting to disembark. Disney was also trying out a new Star Wars churro in Tommorow Land while we were there   red and blue light saber churros. They were wildly popular immediately. And Disney actually had their employees manually tracking which color churro a customer ordered on a paper check sheet (great use of technology Disney!). This would have been fine, but the additional time it was taking for the 1 employee (yes, these were only at 1 Churro Cart with a single employee) to do this was causing additional delays to the already crazy long lines of 30 people at almost all times (not an exaggeration). Dodon't waste your time in this line, they taste the exact same as a normal churro (only with added coloring). Disney needs to do something to limit the amount of admissions per day (dated tickets or something of the like), learn better crowd control techniques and appropriately staff the park with well trained staff or look at a major expansion.On the plus side, they have recently added Fast Pass to the Matterhorn and the Toy Story Midway Mania, which is helping with being able to get on more rides. That said, it is still worth going   just dodon't expect  Disney Magic.  Expect your everyday run of the mill theme park plus Mickey Mouse. This is not Walt's Disney anymore, it is Wall Street's Disney.",2
"We enjoyed our visit to Disneyland but wodon't come again. MAJOR crowds at all times of the day night and super long waits for rides. We spoke with a few employees who basically said that there's no longer any real  off season  and it's like this most of the time. Most of the characters were great, really interactive and we had fun. The exception was Darth Vader, he was a real jerk, basically refusing to allow us to have our pictures taken separately. It happened that he was the first character that we saw so it almost made us not bother with the rest. I'm glad we did though, because the rest were really great, especially Tigger, Eeyore and Pooh!",2
"By 9 pm there are a firework in the very heart of the park and its virtually imposible to get from one section to another to ride other attractions or buy some last minute snacks. So at this time the park is practically closed, the only free way is to the exit, they forced us to exit the park early by yelling at us   please keep walking  they dodon't listen to you.",2
"Of course, Disneyland and California Adventure are wonderful. So much fun, so well done, everyone of all ages loves it. But a word of caution...the bathrooms are filthy. I've never seen such deplorable bathrooms in all my travels. Disney used to be such a pristine place, not I hated having to use any of the bathrooms and dreaded each time my young granddaughter had to go. The bathroom was so busy that there should be a full time cleaning person in each facility. And that leads me to my next observation...there are so many locals that come on the So. Cal. annual pass that it is horrible to us vacationers. We are paying top dollar to come for 3 days on a park hopper, not to mention hotels, etc. It just gets too crowded to enjoy with all the local people that pour into the gates. They need to have some limits on the local crowds or raise the price of the annual pass. I know the bottom line is king, but for those paying full price, the experience is ruined.",2
"On Wednesday, April 26th my brother and our spouses went to Disneyland together. We waited about an hour to get through security and once we arrived to the cast members screening bags my husband opened up my bag he was carrying which had our GoPro with a handheld attachment (which also could extend). The cast member gave us two options: 1) go back to our hotel or car or 2) give it to him and he would discard it for us and can not be claimed after our visit. After begging and pleading and offering to take it a part, he insisted he had to keep the extension of the GoPro (valued at $69.99). Given our circumstance we said we would discard it and he disassembled our device. At 4:00pm when the Mid Day Main Street Parade began we noticed another couple with a GoPro in the park with a fully extended handheld device (the same one we had). I was shocked and completely disappointed. We went through the same security and the same screening process, but somehow I had to throw away my GoPro item and they had theirs fully extended and using it!To make matters even more disappointing, I brought up the Disney website FAQ's that read:  Folding Tripods or monopod stands that can fit in a backpack are permitted.  As I showed this verbiage to the security, he said insisted no was the answer.I am complaining because the GoPro rule was not and is not enforced for every guest who enters the park. I am disappointed in having to throw away a $70 product even after I offered to disassemble it. I hope to hear from someone about how we can resolve this!",2
"We were at Disneyland for 11 hours and only got to ride 5 rides. The lines were to long and the fast passes sucked. We got a fast pass for Indiana Jones but we coulddon't ride it for 4 hours after we received the pass. We were not able to get another fast pass until the Indiana Jones was used. This made us having to stand in all the long lines for 4 hours. Very big disappointment when you have a 4 year old and have to stand in line for 40 minutes and sometimes hours just to ride a short little ride. I dodon't think I will be going back to Disneyland unless I'm rich enough to stay in the Disneyland Hotel and get to do the early entrance into the park and with the prices of the Disneyland Hotel, it will be years or never before I can afford that. It took me a year to save up for this vacation only to be disappointed. ",2
If you want to spend a ridiculous amount of money to be around an enormous crowd you better off going to the Orlando Park.  I would not recommend this park unless your on the west making the travel cheaper.  We will not be back.,2
"Far too many people, rude service, uncomfortable, parades always impeded on foot traffic, not fun and I dont advise bringing family",2
"Ok it's magic but the wait times are absurd. Even with fast pass which is a pain, can only do one every few hours and still need to wait you can only do 4 5 rides in 12 hours when it's busy. Also a number of large popular rides were closed which made waits worse.Hope people will realise the brand is not enough anymoreFront of line like universal would help. Exhausting day and long wait for a few minutes of fun. Food mediocre and long waits so go out to downtown Disney for food as it's better and shorter waits can get monorail although that can also have a 30 minute wait.",2
"Traveled across the country to see Disneyland but unfortunately, it wasdon't ready. Several major attractions were closed for maintenance while several others shut down periodically for whatever reason. We diddon't get to go on the Matterhorn, Pirates of the Caribbean, the Riverboat, Captain Hook's ship, and others I cadon't think of at the moment. The Indiana Jones ride broke down several times during our visit and we were turned away on those occasions. It took us four days to even get to see Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln as it was often closed for some reason.The crowds were unbelievable, even though this was  supposed  to be a quiet off season time at the park. They had something called Annual Passholder days and that may have contributed to the crowds. A local guest said it was as bad as any busy summer day.Overall, we diddon't enjoy our visit and that's a sad commentary. If you look at my avatar you will notice it is a Disney castle. We are big Disney fans and always enjoy Disney World. We were very disappointed with our five days out at Disneyland and the California Adventure. I hate to say it, but we wodon't be going back there after this experience.",2
"After 12 14 visits, I think I'm over Disneyland. To many parades  and shows that bring the flow of movement to a near standstill. The Fast Pass system needs to be revamped;  Front of Line  like maybe",2
"Sadly we went this past Monday which was during spring break for kids. That's not Disney's fault but aredon't from Ca and we diddon't know. I can tell you it's too crowded during spring break. You will spend your whole dayd waiting to ride. We were able to get 1 fast pass but they ran out. We rode 5 rides during our 10 hour day...ugh . Disneyland though is so dirty. There was trash floating in the castle moat, on the streets, on the rides. The bathrooms were dirty and i mean very dirty. We ate at the Blue Bayou and it was delicious. High priced but good. Although Disneyland doesdon't allow alcohol California adventure does so the drunks and i mean very drunk drunks will wonder over. Im sorry Walt we love you but not your original park. We will not be back.",2
"We planned a 3 day vacation to Disneyland ( we are SERIOUS Disney fans) but I have to say  this was a total let down. Everything we wanted to ride was broken. Then we waited for 1.5 hours for Space Mountain ( in the heat) then all of a sudden it was down with   no estimated time  for it to be back up! Then we heard it had already been down 2 times before. We had gotten Fast Passes to Indiana Jones ( everyone gets fast pass, another disappointment  because then what's the point?!!), after we waited for our time ( which was 3 hours later) the ride was down!The crowds were ridiculous and it was total chaos! We wodon't be returning here again, instead we will stick to the parks in Orlando.We wodon't use our 3 day passes at all, we opted to go other places......",2
"Would never go back! I am a senior and went with my six year old grandson and 34 year old daughter. We were all disappointed! Highly overrated. There was not a single ride, store, washroom that we diddon't have to line up for! I expected this but did not expect the pushing and shoving and the excess number of strollers for a Thursday between 9:30 until 3:00 pm. All of us including my grandson were so glad to see the exit. I have been to Tokyo and can tell you honestly that Tokyo during rush hour has nothing on Disneyland. Truly a waste of money! Sorry but that's my opinion! I did see lots of grumpy people that looked like they were experiencing the same type of day!",2
"Spring break crowds and closed attractions left this trip with very few good memories. A song ran through my head as we waited endlessly for tickets, admission, attractions, meals, drinks, the bathroom...Lines, lines, everywhere a lineBlockin'' out the scenery, breakin' my mindWait here, wait some more, can you believe the lines?",2
Let me preface this review by saying Disneyland opened when I was 4; so my expectations and excitement were higher than usual. A huge disappointment! No happy characters greet you at the gate or were ever in sight. Two to three hour waits for rides. Food was horrid. Shops redundant. We left within three hours. A miserable experience. For $110 one would expect to be at least mildly entertained.,2
"We were very excited to visit Disneyland after going to a couple other Disney parks (one being overseas). Unfortunately, we were ultimately disappointed. The rides were very dated for most of the park and the workers weredon't up to the level that they were at Disney World. California Adventure Park, on the other hand, was very well done and a good experience. Disneyland is very small and we were debating between going here and Universal Studios. In hindsight, we were probably better off going to Universal Studios in lieu of this but our curiosity got the better of us. There are simply too many people and not enough rides. The lines are ridiculous   which we expected   and there is a crazy amount of people there with small infants (many less than 4 6 months old) and toddlers with strollers in such a small space. Disneyland is definitely showing it's age   I would skip the park and go to California Adventure if you must go to the park. The lines are terrible there too   but the environment is much nicer.",2
"My wife and I visited Disneyland today. We tend to visit every few years but this will be the last visit until things change. It's always busy but today was impossibly busy likely due to Spring Break. But if this were any other business it would be shut down for being over occupancy numbers. This is a tragedy waiting to happen. There is literally no space to walk especially as ride lines become extended and further block available walking space. God forbid someone had an emergency or some major event happened.What I truly dodon't understand is why they be doing repairs on some rides if they know this is the busiest time of the year. Also, they claim to raise the prices in the busy season but I'm not at all convinced this is really done to reduce crowds. If they wanted to reduce crowds that would simply put quota on ticket sales and guests entering the park. Force people to make reservations (lottery if necessary) and reduce same day ticket sales entries.The park was an overcrowded mess today. With rides closing down constantly (we had a stretch where we went to 4 rides consecutively with fast passes and each ride was closed down for repairs), lines weaving everywhere it was often very difficult to try to understand where the line actually started, long lines for food and bathrooms, etc. It was comically annoying and actually quite pathetic and I kept wondering why I had paid so much for this. It felt very overrated.Disney badly needs to stop thinking about only making money and actually try to think about providing a quality experience again and this will begin with crowd control. As far as I can tell they currently dodon't have any quotas or restraints on park entries and the fastpass system broke down today on multiple occasions. The park just coulddon't handle the number of people within its boundaries and the most popular rides were pushed to their brink which ultimately led to many breakdowns. As for me, I will be spending my money elsewhere. This has become the tourist trap of all time tourist traps.",2
"Top attractions Matterhorn, Railroad, Riverboat and several others are closed for refurbishment. They need it, as they keep stopping. Evacuation procedures are awful, needing more than a half hour to get people off a stopped ride. They dodon't advise about the closed rides before you buy a ticket, but that is part of the Disney culture: grab as much money as they can. There are lots of other people who will keep the lineups full. You need lots of patience and ways to entertain kids in hour long lineups.",2
"As a long time Disney theme park visitor and a HUGE Disney fan, I am saddened to say how disappointed I am to have to rate the park so low. The chaos may be partly to blame for the massive amount of construction and overhaul the park is currently undergoing. It is difficult to understand why decisions to close some bathroom facilities for rehab while not providing additional options were made. Closing down the train that moves people from one side of the park to the other is also a very bad move. People can barely get around most hours of the day and several ride closures complicated things further. There aredon't enough places for people to sit and rest and the fast pass system is antiquated and there isdon't a system in place to allow people to exchange a pass if a ride breaks during their allotted time. The situation during the parade times is dangerous. There is absolutely no way an emergency situation can be handled. I cadon't recommend a visit until all construction as been completed.",2
Was very excited to visit the disneyland on my trip to LA from australia but its very busy down there even on monday. Paid $97 each for 1 day 1 park.. Went with a baby and its started raining. There is not much proper shelter as everyone is trying to get inside .. and instead of helping people they start selling there overpriced umbrellas and ponchos... the food was very expensive inside and quality is 0... few rides were closed... got stuck on space mountain for 20 mins and had to come through emergency stairs around 8:20pm went there on fast pass and still waited around 30 mins in fastpass line ... no apologize though and handed a pass to skip the line for other ride when its closing in 40 mins and had to watch electric prade at 8:30 as well... had no choice but just to throw that card. Big lines and waiting times are approx 30 60 mins atleast in every ride . Staff is not friendly nor helpful as waited with the baby for 20 mins in star wars lines only to get it know that babies are not allowed on this ride. Didnt you see the people with babies . Even in front of us has a 2 year old girl and they have to get out as well. If people think that staff service in disneyland if great than the have never seen one in other countries. Come down under to gold coast's dreamworld or seaworld or movieworld here and u ll know what a helpfull staff and great service is. ,2
"Disneyland opened the year I was born. Living in San Diego, my parents made sure Disneyland was an annual trek for our family   I remember the days of coupon books, and our station wagon glove box was full of partially used ticket books (all the A & B coupons   LOL!), and admission was around $5. You could go for the day and ride every single good ride multiple times. Once, we went on Space Mountain TEN TIMES! Nowadays, ticket prices are well in excess of $100 and you're lucky if you make it onto 3 rides. In December, we waited in line for Thunder Mountain three times. After an hour of waiting, the ride broke down. This happened twice more. Same happened on Indiana Jones. I finally complained that we had been in the park for more than five hours and had only managed to get onto one  good  ride (Star Wars) and a supervisor gave us a  front of the line  ticket to any premium attraction. After the third breakdown on Thunder Mountain, we decided to just leave the park. We went on a total of three rides. They do have a  Fast Track , but you're only allowed to use that for one attraction at a time. Seriously, Disneyland just needs to limit the number of admissions to ensure guests can at least get on some rides. Very disappointed. Only gave it two stars for the nostalgia of how great the park was when I was a child teenager young adult.",2
"I have been going several times a year for about 10 years. I dodon't live in SoCal but I travel there often. I take my now 13 year old son. The magic morning early entry used to be somewhat exclusive, but now it's almost as crowded as any other time. My son and I could ride a few rides for about the first 2 hours after the park opened, but after that, it was not worth standing in lines for hours to ride a couple rides. We spent a lot of time offsite eating out, and in our hotel watching movies. We would try to go back in the evening but it was really tough to do anything. I get the concept of the more paying customers the more money, but our time at Disneyland has finally come to an end. We are now looking for other things to do other than come to that park. That's too bad because it really is a nice park. We did enjoy our times there, so my review score is only for this trip, not cumulative. Our trips back in the late part of the last decade and the early part of this decade were terrific.",2
"Well I wish my review could be different as I love Disneyland and always have, but not this time. We travelled their Feb 19 24 and were sadly disappointed and may not return. The staff who used to be so friendly were mostly bothered by the tourists, I was shell shocked as I remember staff being so friendly and part of the magic, but now it's just like anywhere else. I especially noticed that the people working the rides seemed almost annoyed; they woulddon't smile, barely spoke to you and rushed you through like cattle. I actually was shocked when I asked the girl running the buzz light year, if they took a fast pass, she looked at me and shook her head no and then turned away. I remember the park being so friendly and happy, but not anymore, I think they need to work on their training. We paid full price for our hopper passes, and expected some of the rides to be down as its low season; but at one point, Indiana Jones, The old railroad, Pirates of the Caribbean, bobsled ride, Grizzly, Ferris wheel, Screaming California and the carousal were all down. We paid a lot for these tickets and half the rides were down, which then made the few rides with 160 minute wait, like ridiculous. The food at the park was terrible and so expensive, but on a positive note ESPN outside the parks was awesome and so was the Rain forest cafe. All in all if you go, be prepared that staff are no longer as kind and friendly, losing the magic of the park, and its becoming just like anywhere else, over priced, broken rides, with little to no customer service. We have gone every year for the last five years but think we will be switching to a beach vacation instead, which makes us kind of sad but unless things improve its just not worth it :.(",2
"We used to love going when our kids were young however after waiting to pay for the $20 parking then we get to security and they have our four university kids go through the metal scanner and not us. Just so happens our daughters friend originally from India. I dodon't think that is a coincidence at all since they never asked us and we were behind them.Add to that it was my husband that forgot his large pocket knife in his pocket and our kids had nothing on them. So much for good security but that is what you get with discriminating against youth  and other races.It's one thing to wait for lines but quite another for several of the washrooms to closed or as one staff told us  the line up for the women's restroom is a nightmare .Add to that two of the best rides were closed. For some reason Disneyland does not bother to post that at the gate. I really think they should give a reduced rate when some of the major rides are closed.Then the food is and has been absolutely gross. I dodon't know how a kid friendly socially responsible business can serve such deep fried crap. I realize some parents allow kids that stuff but at least offer some healthy options.So with the open discrimination, the closed rides, the awful food and the terrible line ups it will be a very very long time before we come back if ever.",2
"Attended Disneyland on Feb 21 2017 and I must say that the operation of their attractions has to be the worst I have ever seen at any amusement park. Upon arrival at the park when it first opened at 9AM until 5PM we had made attempts to go on several rides (Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Peter Pan, Star Tours, Small World, Buzz's Astro Ride, Peter Pan and the Railcar Rollercoaster). We only made it onto 2 of these rides (Peter Pan and the Railcar) in a total of 8 hours due to  rides breaking down . We had waited in line and obtained FastPasses for the rides that had them only to find ourselves in line or on the ride and having to evacuate due to the mechanical issues they were having. Having spent $1500 to make a day trip here from Canada this was far from what we had originally planned for. We finally went to CityHall and were compensated with 4 FastPasses (which technically we already had previously, and at this point in the day the lines were minimal) and $20 food voucher. Following our trip and still being dissatisfied with the experience we spoke with customer relations and they had said that we had already been heavily compensated and there is nothing more they would offer. Pretty pathetic for a company that is worth $170 billion dollars to deny a dissatisfied guest the request for FastPasses to use for their next visit (which doesdon't cost Disney anything at all) to entice them to come back and attempt to rejuvenate their feelings towards their original experience. I am not sure that I will ever be back after having gone through this. Great customer service at the park for giving us the extra FastPasses and $20 food voucher but terrible customer service by guest relations on the phone call conversation following. In reference to how much of a run around it was for us, I had my iPhone tracking my steps for that day   We walked a total of 16km's due to walking around attempting to find rides that weredon't broken down and went on a total of 6 rides that day and were there until the parade ended.. Great workout though I guess.",2
"WE went to Disneyland with 70,000 other people. The park was so crowded that we could not enjoy it! Disney has a brilliant idea of making the lines go onto the walking paths. This makes it impossible to get around. Fast pass was full at every ride, so we just had to wait in line. They are trying to navigate crowd control and it is not working! I was very disappointed and I spent a lot of $$ to go. I will not travel to Disneyland for a very long time. One of our family members had a huge panic attack and the only help we got was to walk through the shops. I know that Disney has another way out and to get around. We just needed help getting our family member out without any more issues! I was very disappointed in Disney's lack of help!!",2
"I went to Disneyland today (Feb 13, 2017) and was not only disappointed, but disgusted with Disney management. The park said a couple rides were closed while they built a Star Wars attraction. However, they made no mention that Pirates of the Caribbean and Matterhorn were also closed   who knows why? So for your $97 admission & $20 to park you got fewer rides and long lines   even on a low attendance day. Then there was a 5 car fire in the garage, so they closed it as well as the trams. People (myself included) were in the line waiting for a tram, and we were told trams would be at the far end of Downtown Disney. So we all walked a long distance only to be told  no trams, so walk to the garage    another LONG distance. Upon arrival at the garage Disney stall said  IT WAS CLOSED TO EVERYONE  because of the long ago extinguished fire. So, every had to stand & wait TWO HOURS until the garage re opened. If people had been told about the garage back in the park, they could have done other things while waiting for admittance to the garage, back in either park instead of standing around a lot with no seating and NO bathrooms. Disney's management has atrocious communications skills and are bad at their jobs. Walt would roll over in his grave if he saw how Disneyland's guests were treated.Save your money until you can fly to Orlando and go to DisneyWorld. I'd rather BURN $100 bills, than return to Disneyland in Anaheim.",2
"Spent over $1500USD for a family of 5 with 3 day pass at Dis Cal land in late January. Crowds were epic, worst I have experienced anywhere in the world making. Each day at least two of their prized blue ribbon rides were closed for maintenance, which upon re opening had lines up to 2 hours long! Fast passes got us onto them all with a 1 hour max wait. Such waits though really are excessive, why cadon't the park limit maximum crowd number? Why cadon't families with young kids buy an early entry from 7am like in house guests? Keeping track of young kids in the crowds is most stressful, with park diners offering overpriced poor food that did little to help relax there. Why cadon't Disney service ALL rides each night to minimise risk of failing during opening hours?? Run a ski resort like this and they would fail miserably.",2
Love to visit the park but they need to improve their communication! Why have a live information app if you wait to turn kids away AT THE GATE?!Our situation was unusual but it was disappointing: it's not Disneyland's fault we visited during a rainy weekend. We waited until evening when the rain cleared away to head to the park only to be told at the gate it was closing early. I had been watching the app for any info but there'd been no warning. It haddon't occurred to me to check twitter because i assumed the Disneyland app would show an alert but no :( a ticket wasted and a hysterical child to take back to our hotel. So make sure you check ALL their sources of communication!,2
"I have been going to Disneyland about once a year for about 20 years now. After my visit this past weekend, I think it will be a much longer stretch before I go back again. I was expecting heavy crowds, since I made the choice to go over a weekend, but was still overwhelmed when I was in the thick of it all. People with strollers clog up many areas of the park and made it very difficult to get around. Several rides broke down throughout the day, one happened when we were next to get on the ride. Another ride posted a 45 minute wait for standby, but it turned out to be 90 minutes. We waited in line for 60 minutes for a game playing ride, only to have the game not work once our car got inside. Food and drink prices had gone up even more since my last visit. One of the people in my party got sick after eating a salad at the park. The park itself, usually pristine, was a mess. Garbage cans were overflowing in many of the eating areas and bathrooms were unclean. We had lovely interaction with only two employees during our visit, most others seemed just  Blah  about working there. It seemed like the park was understaffed and unprepared for the large crowd. With the increase in ticket prices, I expect Disneyland to continue to operate with excellence and provide exceptional service. They missed the mark by a wide margin on this visit.",2
"Rides are fine; place is clean but it's a big corporation looking to get the most money from you for the least amount of work. There's no good time to come here. If there are fewer customers, they reduce their staff. Sadly, customers are second class. It would be so bad if the trucks today. I'd understand if it was $30 per person and you had to wait online for 40 minutes, and sometimes two hours. But the they charge so much to get in that there should be better service.",2
I have visited Disney for 20 years. great times . great memories. Over the last 5 years the park has become more crowded or less staffed. The rides are not kept up like they used to be or they are used harder . Disney used to be pristine. from rides to hedges to sparking restrooms. This is not the case any longer. It seems that good enough is the new standard. Having major attractions closed for renovations is part of the maintenance. Having 3 of your 6 major rides down seems like i am being ripped off. The food is 3 out of 10. the price is 400% out side in the real world. if you are going to charge me. that rate have the decency to make it taste like someone actually tried it before you tried to sell it. Bottom line is   you will go because you are forced by tradition   you will miss the good old days when there was pride taken in doing an exceptional job and a desire to provide you a magical day. my advice pack a lunch and a few snacks. ,2
"We perhaps got this wrong but Disneyland diddon't really offer much for our 18 and 20 year old sons. There are only the five or six rides which after substantive waiting times were a little underwhelming to the point where my wife who gets scared on a Ferris wheel found them  comfortable !!! Again the park is beautifully presented and laid out and ideal for younger kids and Disney tragics, just not the place for older kids and the young at heart looking for challenging rides. No problems trying to find a Disney souvenir or feed as the bulk of the buildings are dedicated to gift shops and eateries.",2
"I woulddon't recommend going to Disneyland unless you enjoy long line ups and crowded people. This place did not offer that true Disney experience in comparison to Disney World. I dodon't think I would ever go back, it had some decent rides, but i spent most of my day waiting in line ups. It felt less like Disney, but more like a amusement park just trying to take your money. ",2
"Are you kidding me?! That is what the sign said on Wednesday, January 4, 2017. It was CRAZY CROWDED! Dodon't get me wrong, I LOVE Disneyland but this was insane! When I lived in Southern California, I had an annual pass. We would go on off days to avoid the crowds. We came down on off days and rainy days, hoping that it would keep the crowds low. I guess everyone had the same idea! This year our kids had a weird Holiday schedule. So I thought it would be fun to make a quick trip to Disneyland. It was so crowded that it made it hard to have fun. We got in right as it opened and got our first fast pass and then went to ride Indiana Jones. After waiting for 20 minutes in line, they closed the ride. They should offer return tickets for those that had waited in line. It was so crowded that there were horrible lines to use the rest rooms and then you had to wait in line to wash your hands! I've never been to Disneyland where the bathrooms were so poorly maintained. They were dirty! I've never seen this before at this park. Stalls had no toilet paper and there were no paper towels. I even informed a a cast member of the problem and they shrugged their shoulders at me. I'd have to say the most annoying part of this visit was the LINE CUTTING! When did this become acceptable? Everyone was doing it. Old people, young people, little kids, and parents were all cutting in line. You get in line and wait like everyone else has had to do. You should not be able to play, eat, use the restroom, whatever and then when your party is at the front, you push your way up to them!!! NO! NO! NO! Also, people walking in the crowded park texting or using their smart phones and not paying attention to where they are walking. I lost count of how many times I got slammed into by people not paying attention. Play your games, text, read your email or what ever while in line, not while walking. I could go on but you understand. I Love Disneyland and will continue to visit but I think that they need to rethink some of their policies.",2
"Coming from Australia we were very excited but the crowds were incredible. I get it was school holidays but I was shocked. The amount of prams (strollers) and mobility scooters mixed with foot traffic meant everyone was walking at a snails pace, bumper to bumper. The line ups for the rides were at least an hour long each with some up to 4 hrs long. The park itself was beautiful but you coulddon't just simply enjoy it. Lining up for 2 hrs just to get a family photo with Mickey Mouse was sad.",2
The lines just to get through security were over 45 minutes long. Then you have to stand in line again to buy tickets if not pre purchased. Then stand in line again to enter the park. I do not recommend coming here anytime around the year end holidays. The crowds are just too big. ,2
"This is our second visit to Disneyland and maybe our last! We knew it was going to be busy on the holidays but what we dealt with was ridiculous! Last time we came during the summer holidays and it was 5 star all the way this time not so much! Using our park hopper tickets on one of our days was useless for a while as Disneyland was full so we coulddon't go from park to park! The Fastpass system was useless by lunchtime as they were all taken! I feel sorry for the people who were there for a once in a lifetime trip! Walking from place to place was also a nightmare! Disney needs to catch up with the rest of the world and design a Fastpass you can pay for so first timers and people from far away can pay the extra money and get around the park! We felt that this time we did not get value for money and left with sore backs, sore legs and a bitter taste in our mouths! Please Disney think about your park capacity and ways to cater for people during busy times! Oh and if you want to get into the Frozen show good luck! Congratulations to Disney in the profits you have made in the last two days!",2
"We visited on 25th December, Christmas day. Not that we diddon't expect crowd, but the park was overflowing with visitors. Almost no place to stand. And they dont seem to be equipped to handle the crowds. Toilets are a struggle to find (unlike Universal Studios), there are queues for the toilets when you find one. The park maps are filled with tooooo much information for anyone to follow and get the bearings right in the 1st hour. Then they have this Fast Pass system which makes you run around the entire park a few hundred times. We walked almost 7 miles within the park on 1 single day, trying to get done with most rides. Eventually we did manage to do all the rides which needed the fast pass, but you gotta be on your toes from 9 am to 9 pm to be able to achieve that.The rides are superb. None of them to be missed. The Parades are something the kids and adults enjoy to watch.Overall it was a bad experience for the amount of crowd in the park. I would STRONGLY recommend a visitor to choose a working weekday (if possible) to visit the parkAnd to Disney to restrict the crowds to a manageable number. I understand its business for you and should be maximized, but not at the cost of such inconvenience for people with families looking to have a good time",2
"First the good parts. Disneyland Park is an iconic park that is a must see tourist attraction. However, Disneyland has 1 major flaw, which becomes quite evident in the first 2 hours there. Disneyland has a severe shortage of restrooms. It is baffling that a company as sophisticated as Disneyland did not account for sufficient restroom capacity inside its iconic park! For men, it's better. But for women who want to use restroom, forget about it! The line for women restroom is so long for every restroom in Disneyland park. Shameful for whoever is in charge of this at Disneyland park. ",2
That fast pass is the most bogus thing ever... why shoulddon't everyone just wait the old fashion way. When it come to it i see a bunch of people pass everyone elses kids. So many sad faces because of this. If it is 2 lines you need then by all means have 2 lines,2
"A long planned for holiday to LA and Disneyland over the December holiday break turned out to be a big disappointment. The Park was so crowded that it was impossible to enjoy. Waits for rides were so long that they were impractical for younger children to take part. Food outlets were manic and seating was in very short supply. The famed  smiling staff  were nowhere to be seen   just frowns of resignation to the fact that too many entrance tickets had been sold to make the visit worthwhile.If you are an international guest who will pay thousands of dollars to get to this overrated theme park, do not plan a Xmas visit. You are wasting your money.",2
"I must say after visiting here a few times in the 2000's I was very disappointed with the park this time. The toilets were not clean, many over flowing, the water fountains were blocked and rubbish was strewn throughout the streets. This may have been because the park was at capacity and then some. I remember a time when the guest service agents smiled and said hello, this time it was very obvious the staff were unhappy, I even heard a conversation between two disgruntled employees. This may be a Gen X thing, I dodon't know, but the magic used to be the aura of happiness. Tokyo Disney leaves this one for dead. ",2
"They say it's the happiest place on earth. Well after paying almost $100 per day to get in there along with 100,000 other people. You wait in line for the majority of the day to get on rides. You can only use a fast pass so often and they are limited to some rides. No wonder you need to buy a 5 day pass and even with that you dodon't get the whole experience of the park. Shame on you Disneyland and your cooperate greed. I remember when it was the happiest place on earth. Not anymore. I wodon't return.",2
We were so disappointed by our visit. We love visiting the Disney parks in Orlando  this one is no comparison. This location is a cramped park with tons of rude people and long lines. Not fun....,2
"I'm currently standing in an hour and a half long line just to get on Finding Nemo. If your favorite ride is Space Mountain, expect a two and a half hour wait. The amount of people that are allowed into the park is ridiculous. We have to follow lines to get from land to land. I use to come here every year up through high school, never have I experienced so many people at Disneyland. Eventhough this is  peak season,  I wish those who operate the park would care about the happiness of the visitors who pay over $100 a ticket versus their net profit. Disney, everyone standing in these lines and herding through the park look miserable. Please take this post to heart.",2
"I have been visiting Disney for over 40 years, we are season pass holders who visit a few times a year. This is the first time we have encountered so many broke down rides and rude employees. Its like the whole culture at Disney has changed and they need to get it back quick.",2
I was shocked to see how much the entrance to Disney has increased. We visited on Sunday 30th October and opted for single day hopper passes. I was shocked to see that the price was $160 bucks each... $320 total...Thank god no kids in tow! Granted I have not visited there since 2004 but I am sure that back them a three day hopper cost me less...Trying to cram in both parks into a single day means that it is nigh on impossible to do everything which equals very poor value. On top of this some of the Disneyland staples like Splash Mountain and Its A Small World were closed. Could not get on The Tower of Terror due to120 mins line which was fairly consistent for the whole day. Oh I almost forgot if you are driving add another $18 for parking. Also when you are in you are locked into the ridiculous prices of food and drink like $4 for a bottle of water!...Talk about daylight robbery! The whole price of the thing now seems a total rip off and is disproportionate to the experience that you get once inside...The whole thing has left a sour taste so will probably not be visiting again. : (,2
"I was in Anaheim for a day (10am   7pm) and thought I would check it out since I love Disney so much. The food, drinks and souvenirs are definitely not worth the price they are charging. Most of the attractions i found were for young kids and the wait times for the rides were an hour or more.",2
"We have been to Disneyland many, many times. This last visit was the worst. For $160 per ticket, one should be able to ride more than 4 5 rides a day. The crowds were horrendous. Thinking that it may have been close to capacity. The fast pass system is a broken system. The passes are dispersed and  sold out  at the beginning of the day, and the returns allow too many people to use fast pass. This makes the wait times even longer.Hoping that this is our last Disney trip.",2
I have visited Disneyland about 25 times over the last 40 or so years. I have seen many changes. I took my children when they were young. I have taken some of my grandkids here. This was the worst ever visit. The price is way too expensive. Much of the park was closed. Even Small World was closed. The steamship Columbia doesdon't move. Tom Sawyer Island... closed. Old Bear Country area closed. Then they closed the park at 6PM so they could charge another $70 for Mickey's Halloween party. Greed is the word of the day now at  The Most Expensive Place on Earth .,2
This theme park is always too overcrowded I feel like I'm paying $120 to stand on line all day and listen to Disney music.  One time was enough for my family and kind of an inconvenience.  Not very fun either.,2
"Disneyland used to be a place where everyone could afford to go and have a good time. In recent years the park has gotten so overcrowded that you can wait upwards of 4 hours to get on 1 single ride. They keep raising the ticket prices saying they offer a good value for your money, which is not true. Most of the time you cadon't even get on the ride of your choice. They raise the food prices it seems every 3 4 months. Not a fun place to visit anymore and Disney has priced me out of future visits.",2
"We've been to Disney world three times in the past five years so decided to give Disneyland a go this time. We went mid week in October and the resort was as busy as I've seen on a weekend at Disneyworld. The whole day was ruined as we only got on four rides and walking around was like being part of a chaotic parade, with bumping, jostling and challenges to get anywhere. Disney needs to do better and limit access to the park. Selling unlimited tickets is a terrible experience for guests and terrible value as well. ",2
I just got finished using a annual pass. Last yea things seem to be hoping at Disneyland. As the year has gone by I have gotten more and more disappointed. The last visit that was in October 2016 was quite disappointing. Splash mountain and that whole area was closed down. Most the rides in Disneyland had glitches and were closed on and off. The place seems a bit dirty not kept up well. And the crowds are totally out of control. They have brought out a really old parade and the fireworks were quite disappointing. I'm not renewing my pass. Over at California adventure they will be closing Tower of Terror. The parade there hasdon't changed at all. Toy story ride seems dirty like they need to clean the sidewalks and umbrellas Hopefully things will get better in the next few years,2
"We were there with our family 10 13 16. It was near impossible to get on any rides and we feel like we wasted money just to walk around the park, eat horrible food and bump into other frustrated people. I know the park is for kids and sometimes you just have to deal with crowds to make them happy, but this trip was ridiculous. If they are going to sell that many tickets to get into the park they should have a way for people to track it and decide if they want to try another day.Another disappointing thing was the characters that used to be found walking around the park were nowhere to be found. This was very disappointing. We waited in lines to get pictures with the characters only to get to the front of the line in time for breaks. This added to the frustration of an already frustrating day. The lady asking for feedback in the park was given. This same information. Hopefully they can come up with some way to truly make this the happiest place on earth, because it wasdon't for us.",2
"As a family, we've logged hundreds of days at Disney parks, and have never had a bad experience. Even when we attend while busy, the experience has still been great. That is, until Friday Oct. 21st. Disneyland closed at 7 for a trick or treating event. I noticed on their website that they were doing this, but never imagined that they would kick a full paying customer out early, but that wasdon't the worst part. If you diddon't have a wrist band, you coulddon't even use the restrooms at the back of the park! My wife had to struggle all the way to main street to get in an insanely long line for the restroom. Then, while waiting for her, I tried to purchase some items and a beverage in a nearby shop, and was denied entrance, and told it was for wrist bands only! So let me get this straight, we pay over $300 each for park hoppers, but a trick or treating wrist band holder is more valuable? The trick or treaters weredon't buying anything in the shops, but many of us wanted to at least shop since we were being excused early from riding the attractions. No dice! This is classic double dipping! Park hoppers paid full price for a day, but got kicked out 5hours early, and the trick or treaters, paid $50 for half day, I guess we'll be going to Universal or Magic mountain from now on.",2
"I love Disneyland!!! I have been there 8 times from Canada over my 40 years of life. I still enjoyed it a lot, but there are things that happened this time that I just dodon't know if it's worth it anymore. We looked at several sights and came to the conclusion Early Oct is a great time to visit. Nice weather and not to buys. We looked at what rides were closed and decided to go and take the kids out of school. It was busy. very busy. If this is considered not busy    then my point is made for me. Long lines. Long waits. I think it has to do with so so many season passes. Almost everyone paying for meals and merchandise had a season pass card to get their discount. I understand economics. Disney just doesdon't care about the experience as long as they are full. But for me, I just dodon't think we can do it anymore and fight with the wall to wall traffic. On top of that we made sure that splash mountain was suppose to be open .. then on day 3    we go over to that area    big sign up the area is closed. So we ask the person standing there    for how long? A month!!! We were not the only people complaining. On top of that I have never in my other 7 times experienced the high level of break downs!! Thunder mountain many times. Space mountain also. Even some of the smaller rides like Snow white was down for periods of time. With all the extra season pass money you think they could pay for some maintenance so things would stay up. A once great place is now just run to maximize profits. The experience is secondary as long as people show up. Walt .. we need you back. This place has lost it's way.",2
There are so many people here now that it is almost not fun anymore. Some of the lines are 120 minutes. Thats 2 hours waiting in a line for a 5 minute ride. There is a lot of construction going on right now so a few of the attraction are closed down.,2
Disneyland is my favorite vacation but it's way to busy in October. A friend I was with during this trip said it was busier than their summer visit! Lots of rides closed down for temporary repair when had waited in line for 1  hrs. Very frustrating!,2
Waay too crowded. Couldnt get near the street parade or restaurants or rides. One hour queue to see a fairy princess was too much. bit expensive too. Staff say they close the doors at 98000 ppl. fast pass yourself to nother place,2
"The security line to get into the area to purchase tickets and stand in line to get in takes half an hour. Then the line to get in takes another half hour because they take pictures of everyone, even if you are entering for only a day. RIDICULOUS. Terrible way to start a day at  the happiest place on Earth. ",2
"Having been to Disney World quite a few times in the past, the day we spend at Disneyland during our Honeymoon in the LA area was quite a disappointment. There were so many things closed for refurbishment that it was just ridiculous. Finding just traditional american food (burgers, chicken, etc withut a ton of regional spices seasoning) was next to impossible without traversing half the park. Even on a weekday, the park seemed pretty packed with kids (dodon't they have school in California???). For the price of the ticket, I'd look elsewhere for entertainment unless you have kids who really want to go here.",2
"Sorry folks, I know it's probably going to be perceived as downright un American to not love this place, but I just have to say it's become a commercially driven, chaotic, not so kid friendly place. I guess if you like to dodge crowds and think pushing a stroller through masses of people is fun, you may enjoy it. But for the $270 for 2 days for one adult, this grandma would rather go someplace quieter, slower and less over stimulating for little kids. This admission is just be beginning. Food and drinks are expensive, and photos are being snapped everywhere so, of course, they are trying to get you to buy them. Just enough already! Older kids no doubt will love it, but seriously lacking in activities that appeal to small kids without a really long wait in line. Hello, someone out there at Disney...kids 3 and under dodon't really want to WAIT that long for a 2 minute ride. We stood in line for 45 minutes at the Ariel ride, leaving 2 strollers outside. When we came back, they had been moved by the staff and it took another half hour to locate ours. I dodon't know, maybe I'm getting old, but for the money I dodon't think the experience is what I want my grandkids to be raised on. Buy, buy, buy, more, more, more. It's lost it's charm, and maybe parents grandparents should rethink the message it's teaching.",2
"After a lifetime of wanting to go to Disneyland and hearing that it was the happiest place on earth, I found it Meh.....We went at the end of August so I should have known better, but oh my word the crowds, oh the crowds.....WOW..... it was step, shuffle, another step shuffle, shoulder to shoulder people, two hour line ups for a ten minute ride, pushing, shoving, rude people, standing in line, oh the line ups were so horrible, so long.Being terrified of losing your family because you would never find them again and I mean never.Haunted Mansion was shut down which was SOOOO disappointing, as well as the train.Line ups for food were so longThere were so many people we coulddon't even see anythingIt was so hot you know being California and all, but some shade over the line ups would have been nice.Completely surprised that this is allowed as far as safety is concerned.I was pleasantly surprised by how clean the park was and how there were no line ups at the bathrooms. Kind of confusing actually.Dodon't get me wrong it was Disneyland so we did kind of have fun, no never mind it wasdon't fun at all. It really wasdon't but keep in mind we did go in August, so if I ever go back (I shutter at the thought) it will be in November.",2
"I always heard disney is supposed to be all happy with happy people and happy things from non to living things...why are these people all sad n have attidudes for. The fast pass there sucks, I do not like them at all. Such a small packed place there. Only ride I loved of course was the tower of terror...in my opinion I will forever LOVE disneyWORLD, I call DISNEYWORLD a happy place with great attidudes. What happen to west coast people being  chilled  LOL",2
"The size of this park is tiny, definitely not worth the high entry fee! It's iconic and that's probably why it stays afloat. The Star Wars addition was ok, I thought it would have more then one movie, one museum, and one ride. It advertised it was much bigger. Hyper Space mountain was a ride we all enjoyed. Just very disappointed in the amount of thrill rides this park had. Very minimal, should be better then what it was for the $100 admission per person. The rides are comparable to a county fair! Definitely needs a facelift! The fireworks were cancelled last minute due to the wind? What wind??! A local & an employee advised this happens often! Probably a slick way for Disney to save some money! Disappointing to folks like me , who dodon't get out to California. This was a once in a lifetime thing. I'll be back to Cali def not to Disneyland! Utter disappointment for my family. My kids were looking forward to it, but they were not happy at the end of the day. Shame on you Mickey! ",2
"We felt this park was overrated for a family, huge lineups, rude guests and staff members.  Been there, done that is the best we can say",2
"This was the 2nd time i visited within 4 months on a week day and both times they canceled the fireworks due to winds,,, REALLY??? It was so blazing hot not a puff of wind to be had.. Its Disney packing people beyond the limits at 160.00 for a day pass, serving crappy expensive food and not coming through at the end of the day... This was NOT a diamond celebration but rather a cubic zirconium celebration.",2
"So, getting right to the cons...too expensive for the quality of service and attractions. 400$ plus for one day. Lines, hoards of people everywhere, pushing, running into you, vying for the best spot to view the parade, fireworks, etc. Food and drink is beyond over priced and restaurants are difficult to get seating without reservations. Parking is more $$$ added to your day. It was just a let down. Disney should not allow so many people in the park per day and it could be the Happiest Place On Earth. But right now it's just a scam for Disney to make as much money as they can. My kids  6&8  preferred Knotts...and so did my husband and I!",2
"Too many people, and Disney's application which is supposed to display the current  waiting time for each attraction is useless because Disney doesdon't provide wifi!!!  Its wifi partner, AT&T, must be upset !  The staff doesdon't even care about this contradiction.",2
"Did you know selfie sticks are dangerous?It seems the folks at Disneyland think so. So much so that they will take them from you and destroy them with no form of compensation to the affected party. Oh they give you the option of doing a 40 minute round trip back to your car or hour round trip back to your hotel, but why would a  guest  want to do that? So they took my stick, my complaints to the bag checker and his supervisor went unheard EVEN THOUGH the day before the same security guard diddon't notice it was in my bag and I was allowed in with this weapon of mass destruction. My next recourse was to wait 30 minutes at  Guest Relations  to discuss my unhappiness at the happiest place on Earth. My customer service rep gasped when I told him I was not happy. Nicely done. Once the reason was discovered however he lost compassion and explained to me that company policy prohibited such items in the park and it clearly stated this on the website. Fine. I discussed my desire to be placated...compensated...somehow made happy after being treated like a criminal. To which said representative informed me that he had no ability or authorization to do so. I promptly asked for a supervisor who came minutes later. Once again I recounted my story and received the same reply...policy...prohibited...website...sorrySo I asked again what can YOU do to ease my irritation. Her reply was to pull out a blue form so that I could register my complaint. Needless to say I was not amused and left the area with a loud retort of  useless  as I left. As I stand in line for Nemo and write this I notice children playing roughly with onsite purchased light saber toys which in my estimation are more of a nuisance then a rotund 50 year old with a selfie stick. But hey what do I know....I diddon't come up with the policyNow I have been visiting Disney parks since 1977....before the Internet (yes there was a time before smart phones and snippity snappity chat). And I have had overwhelmingly positive experiences in both Orlando and Cali. Not today howeverTo this I say Boo....boo to Blue Form Letters, boo to no one caring at all in Guest Relations, and BOO to the fact that two days admission to the park, food and souvenirs cost me close to 1000.00 and one of the richest businesses on Earth coulddon't be bothered to offer me a free lunch or discount coupon for something to say  sorry I dodon't expect this review to influence any guests. It is fun to come here... Just remember leave your WMDs in your car or hotel before you come",2
"After years of anticipation Disneyland failed to live up to the hype. The rides are dated and average compared to the likes of universal studios, ridiculous wait times, break downs, a stupid amount of visitors led to us leaving very disappointed and wishing we had spent our money elsewhere! Unfortunately the magic of Disneyland must only exist if you are 7 years and under. Personally I would not waste my time taking a young family here, not only is it expensive for entry, food is expensive, merchandise is expensive and wait times are ridiculous  especially for young children! Disneyland needs to take a leaf out of Universal Studios book... Covered areas for ride queues and front of the line passes might make it more enjoyable for people",2
"I know this will not be a popular review, but I'm being honest about our experience. I am a native of SoCal. I grew up going to Disneyland, and when I was first in college I worked at Disneyland. Now, the lines are so long that you're lucky to get in more than four or five rides in a day. Taking a four year old on Nemo took 2 hours! Seriously, half our group was waiting, so we know exactly how long it took. Also, the crowds are so thick that you cannot see the  land  as you walk through. Everything looks the same because it's all noisy dense crowds of people. Sure, it was decades ago, but I remember having the distinct feeling of  Oh, we are in Fantasy Land now, and here we are in Jungle Land, etc. But Disneyland has lost its charm or ability to give you that experience of magical environments. This visit was midsummer, so perhaps a rainy day would give a better experience. But over all, Disneyland is just an outrageously expensive buzzkill. BTDT   got the t shirt. Take the family to the beach instead. We did that the following day and everyone had a better time. No waiting in line to play in the sand and waves, and no obstacle to seeing that you are one the edge of the Pacific Ocean.",2
"Very disappointing. Line very long. No good food. Prices are outrageous for everything. Not many places to obtain free water. Park rides seems to be done multiple times a day for maintenance. Two hour waits for the most popular rides. Save your money, by a mickey hat at a local discount store and go to your local amusement park. You will have a better time and it will be a much better value.",2
"Went with family and had 2 day tickets. Previously been to Tokyo and Eurodisney. Also been to multiple other theme parks including Universal studios Singapore and LA amongst others. This was the worst in terms of crowd control. For the shows, some people of the audience standing in front put their kids on their shoulders blocking the views of others! People were even allowed to save seats before some of the shows began up to a certain time. The way the crowds were let into the cinemas also leave a lot to be desired. In Tokyo, the audience is guided into the cinema and led to the seats row by row, filling up every seat beginning from the middle of the aisle. This diddon't happen here and the crowds were left to fill up seats on their own with gaps in between seats.Generally the staff were only average. They handling of a cancelled Jedi training event was poor, handling out FAST passes only to patrons who complained. So tough if you diddon't let your feelings be known. Wodon't visit the park again.",2
"Besides the ticket fiasco (two hours to get family into park). The place was a mad house, shoulder to shoulder, pushing, and just uncomfortable. The rides were sub par and disappointing. Will probably never go back. Will go to California Adventures instead.",2
"Wellllllll, I visited Disneyland last October and the experience was, shall we say, underwhelming. Plus, Blue Bayou restaurant was solid. Plus, park is clean and employees are mostly friendly. Plus, stayed at hotel across the street, so diddon't have to bother parking and waiting in another line. Negatives? Lots. Long, long waits for rides, not wholly unexpected and worst of all, crowding is worse than ever. So, when friends heard my not so great musings on Disneyland, they were bound and determined that I should try it again. Well, it was actually worse. Even MORE crowded, if this was even possible. There still seems to be absolutely no crowd control and fine, I'm used to waits for the rides but, waits to even move in the park? Just shuffle along slowly and push people out of the way? The last time, it was a disappointing  last time  for my mom to see the park but, this time, the kids were tired of it after 5 hours and coulddon't wait to get out. We adults decided to deal with it but, the KIDS wanted out! To be clear, we also took them to Knotts Berry Farm and Legoland, which they loved. Though also crowded, the crowd control seemed more organized. I doubt that Disneyland even bothers to close the doors for past capacity crowds. It's all about the $, apparently. I am so glad that I have fond memories of this place from years ago. I certainly dodon't now. No need to ever go back. On the plus side, my friends insisted that they pay as a  treat . Bless their hearts! They meant well. They also had a rotten time. I thought it was just me, though I kept quiet about it. Wait until January, folks! My friends assured me this is the best time. I have no desire to see if that is true.",2
"We have been a few times in the last few years and the magic is gone. Long wait in lines for a small amount of fun.  Food costs are absurd, we wodon't be going back.",2
The Disneyland personnel are by far inferior to the Disney World personnel.  The park is smaller and many of the attractions were shut down due to them building newer attractions.  That was very disappointing especially when you spend $300 dollars just to enter the park....More,2
"As an older person a trip to Disney with grandchildren is just too expensive. I have been attending Disneyland from the time it opened in the 1950s. My daughter could go there frequently at a price I could afford as a single parent. A majority of the attractions is for small children. For teenagers, Knotts Berry Farm is more fun. As an older adult I would sometimes like to go just for the evening light shows. Too expensive.",2
"This place may be good if you have young children. Granted, we visited on a busy Sunday afternoon and evening, however the park should be built with crowds in mind. We only visited the Disneyland Park, not the adjoining park...thank goodness for that.For adults I think it is a big disappointment if you are trying to follow your childhood dreams.The place looks dated and old. It was surprisingly small in area. The crowds were crammed in. You had to queue for everything, and I mean everything. Food, rides and toilets meant a queue.The fast pass system was great until staff say that they are not issuing fast passes for  whatever  ride anymore.We managed to use two rides or attractions during our 7.5 hour stay. Temple of Doom and Haunted Mansion.The food was terrible, coulddon't even find a hotdog in the USA! Again, more and more queuing.I have never seen so many children crying and upset in one place.The best aspects of the park were the character staff. They did an excellent job. Store staff were not as enthusiastic. So many young people in the park were doing a great job. The saving grace of the experience was the day and night parades. They were brilliant and again, character staff saved the day. The fireworks were excellent as well. At times being obviously  watched  by security staff was off putting.I would not recommend this park for adults, go to the other parks in LA.We had an issue with ticketing that was very well handled by staff, cadon't fault them on that.It may be worth just going for the parades but dodon't get your hopes up for the other attractions if it is a busy time.",2
We try to go to disneyland at least once a year if not more. We returned for Christmas and dodon't plan to go back. The park is overpriced no longer decorated how it was before restrooms are dirty.,2
"Paid a pile of money to stand in lines for hours on end. Lines for security, another big line for admission and still not at a ride yet. 2 hours already wasted! Over the years not much has changed here The Star Wars area was interesting but felt hastily put together. Upon trying to get back to the parking garage i was told all the trams are stopped till further notice and then was told to walk a mile if i wanted to get to my car. RIDICULOUS! Especially after walking all day long with small children. Next time anywhere but here!",2
"I never thought that one day I would stop loving Disneyland but my last visit was so disappointing that I dodon't think I will ever go back. Visited on a Monday in mid May hoping to avoid the weekend and summer crowd. Bought a one day park hopper ticket $160. From the parking lot through the entrance it took one hour to get in. Waited in line for security, waited in line for ticket, waited in line to get through the gate. 10 11 am. Then waited in line 15 min for restroom. There was such a crowd that you could not drop a needle. Average wait for entry to a ride was 45 min. Some rides were giving out fast passes at 11 am, to return at 9 pm! Children were crying and upset with exhausted parents trying to cut through the crowd. Scooters, strollers, wheelchairs were blocking foot traffic there was so many of them, 20 min wait for an ice cream, long lines in front of restaurants, Blue Bayou restaurant was reserved 3 days ahead! You wodon't be able to eat there unless you make reservation many days prior to your arrival. I used to have a yearly pass 10 15 years ago, Disneyland was nothing like this. Disneyland has much to offer but the crowds are unbearable, frustration are on the face on most people. Disneyland is becoming a nightmare. I would rather spend my day anywhere else.",2
"We've been long time Premium Pass holders, spending 18 of our last 20 New Years (& 1 2 extra trips every year) at The Happiest Place On Earth, & decided to combine a last minute trip to Disneyland with a business trip before our passes expire, as we may not renew them due to the price increase. We went in & were shocked to discover the crowds due to ALL the ride, show & attraction closures in preparation for Star Wars Land. It was even more crowded than New Years Eve! I still love Disneyland, but we are probably going to forgoe our annual Family New Years tradition and wait until Star Wars Land opens for the next trip! I feel sad for any first time visitor because this is not the happy place I so dearly love! See photos that were taken at 4:30ish, Saturday 5 21 16 from the bridge in front of the Pirates of the Caribbean, which is also out of commission as a walk way.",2
Not as entertaining as I thought it would be for my boys. They actually loved California Adventure though!,2
"I've always been a fan of Disneyland, having visited the California park twice as a child and the Orlando resort twice in the last 5 years so during a recent trip to Anaheim I coulddon't wait to re visit the original park. Sadly I was disappointed; Disney California lacks the Disney magic and doesdon't have the same vibe. The park felt claustrophobic and vastly over crowded due to the sheer number of people that were pouring through the gates all day long. It was difficult to walk from one area to the next as thousands of people swarmed around. After 5 hrs we only managed to go on 3 rides owing to the 1.5 hr long queues, there was a 30 minute queue for ice cream, a 30 minute queue for coffee and a 15 minute queue to use the filthy restrooms. This is far from Walt Disney's vision.",2
"The Good: it's the happiest place on earth, or it is usually. The Bad, with Star Wars going in, Tomorrowland is closed, and there is so much construction going on even in other areas. Maybe it was the week I was there, but so many things were not open, or working properly. When I went to complain at Town Hall, the guy was really nice, but just gave me 3 fast passes. With 3 of us having annual passes and 2 of us having just paid for 3 day hoppers, they should have done more. BTW, that was 3 fast passes just for one person......me, which just aidon't right. ",2
"I am a SoCal resident, during my last trip to Disney, I wondered for the first time, if greed is overshadowing the magical kingdom and moreover the vision that Walt Disney had laid forward. With increase in price, you would expect the value to go up in regards to one's experience, but not in Disney. Seems like their objective is to let way too many people in the park that you would be lucky, if you could even experience 4 or 5 rides. Well well no one ever forced me to go there, its just that our POP culture has made this entity so powerful that it can just about get away with too many things. Walt Disney may be shedding tears from his magical kingdom up there.",2
"Disney has fallen from its once lofty position as a premium amusement park. During our visit in early May, 2016, many of the attractions rides were closed for refurbishing or updating. I understand these things need maintenance and a fresh coat of paint from time to time, but in consideration of so many attractions rides being shut down, Disney should have knocked a considerable amount off their admission price. There was no discount given for entering a park with many attractions rides unavailable. I would expect that attitude from a 3rd rate park, but Disney used to have a reputation for being family friendly.The park has an odor problem as well. Almost everyplace we stopped to rest had a distinct sewage odor to it. That really takes the magic out of the Magic Kingdom.I purchased what was allegedly coffee from a cart near the castle. It was horrible to put it mildly. I threw it away because it was undrinkable. It cost $3.99. I know, I should have returned it for a refund, but I was concerned about what I might say to the young lady about the quality of the sewage she was selling as coffee.The lust for our money is more evident at Disney than it has ever been. Sad to say, this place is showing its age and is pricing itself into obscurity. There are better places to drop $100 per head. We wodon't be back. I dodon't think Walt would approve of how his once landmark park is being run....down.",2
"Closed:Pirates, Mr Lincoln, Safari boat ride and Indiana jones.Went to the town hall to complain had to wait in line....they then told me to fill out online.Paid 2 adults 1 child almost $400. To watch obese Americans eat cakes, ice cream, etc.According to my child it was a great day. ",2
"Disneyland was disgusting when we were there two weeks ago Wednesday!!! They must be cutting back on help. It just isdon't the same anymore. It wasdon't even crowded, but my husband and I started to walk into two different restrooms and coulddon't use them, we walked right out because they were so filthy!!!We rented a locker and it was filthy too!!! Also, the last 3 visits there, the ponds were so full of algae, they smelled and there were very few ducks!!! I dodon't blame the ducks, they diddon't like that mucky water either!!! We were sitting and eating and got whiffs of the stench. It was a real turn off. They are letting things go. It is so expensive there and they have raised the price of parking, admission, the food and then so many attractions are closed!!! What a rip off!!! We aredon't renewing our pass.Walt Disney would be furious!!!",2
"On April 25th 28th 2016, my wife and I spent three days visiting the Disney Parks at Anaheim California. This was our first visit to Disneyland, we have visited the Orlando Disney Parks in three occasions.Most of our time was spent at Disneyland. We selected the time of our visit (after Easter and before Summer) on the assumption that it would be less crowded. Well, we could not have been more wrong. The crowds were enormous, and the lines and waiting times were very long, usually around 30 45 minutes. In many cases it was nearly impossible to move around the parks without bumping into people or nearly hitting some baby stroller.We used the fast passes whenever possible, but for some attractions, we had to wait in line for at least 30 minutes or more. Adding to our frustrations was that in several instances, after standing in line for 30 minutes or so, the attraction or ride suffered some sort of mechanical problem. This was exactly what happened to us on the Peter Pan ride. When we almost reached the end of the line, there was some sort of mechanical problem, and no one could tell us whether the ride could go back in operation. Because, of this, and because there was no easy exit from the line, we had to jump over barriers and ropes. This was difficult considering our ages.That sort of annoyance also happened at the Winnie the Pooh ride. A similar, and even more frustrating situation happened to us with the  Rollicking Roadsters  at the California Adventures Park. It took us three attempts to finally get on this ride which broke down twice.The Anaheim parks seem to be smaller than the Orlando ones, this perhaps adds to the crowded conditions we encountered. Also, Disneyland does not offer Meal Plans or on  line fast passes. I must also add that in all our visits to Orlando Parks we never encountered so many rides and attractions out of service or breaking down.Our recommendation is that if you want to enjoy the  Disney Magic , you should go to Orlando and during off season times. The parks are larger, they seem to be less crowded, and there are better services, more attractions, more conveniences, and lodgings options..We did little in terms of shopping at the parks or at Downtown Disney, but we were shocked by the high prices of food, drinks, souvenirs, etc. Perhaps there was a time when Disneyland was the  Happiest Place on Earth , but that seems to be long in the past.",2
"Not recommended. Go to Universal Studios. The park is small and crowded no matter when you go. I went on a Tuesday in low season and it was still crowded, you have to make a line even to go to the restrooms. Way smaller than the ones in Orlando. The park is made more for locals than tourists, when in Florida is the other way around.Don  t waste your time.",2
"We have been to Disneyland 8 or more times the past 15 years and this last trip left us with no desire to return. Over 1 2 of the rides were either 'closed for refurbishing', shut down or broken. The wait times for the open rides were extremely long (even with a fast pass). Over three days we were only able to ride 9 rides due to the above mentioned conditions. Many of the operational rides appeared to be in poor condition as well; dirty, chipped paint and cracked plastic.Although we encountered some friendly cast members, many of the staff members were abrasive and it was hard to find the 'good customer service' we have become accustomed to while visiting this park. The stench (? raw sewage) coming from the castle area was overwhelming for all three days of our visit. Every morning we stood in line waiting to get into the park with smiles on our faces in anticipation of reliving past fabulous experiences in Disneyland. Our family certainly noticed the decline of Disneyland as an Adventure Park and we were very disappointed that this has happened. We have decided to spend our vacation dollars in a different place.",2
"We have been here on several occasions now and I have to say we were very disappointed on our last trip. Our 8yr son got crushed by the large volume of people trying to race through a small gate to get the best views of fantasmic. We brought some ice cream from the shop in main street and the staff were really rude to us. We also noticed on our last trip that it was more dirtier around the park than on previous visits from rubbish on the ground to the toilets not being maintained. We were very sad to see so much change with only a year between our visits and for our son to not want to back there, it is supposed to be the  happiest place on earth  well our son doesdon't want to go back there.",2
"Last visited this Disneyland 10 years ago and have great memories, wish I'd left it at that. We were travelling around California and decided to have a day at Disney whilst we were here, the park was as clean and well organised as ever and the staff very helpful and pleasant. Many of the rides were closed, maybe it was the wrong time of year ( April), I dodon't know, but this was disappointing. Of the rides that were left open, 2 of the main ones that we wanted to do Splash mountain and the Indiana Jones adventure kept breaking down and ended up being closed. Over all this left us feeling that it wasdon't worth the effort or expense of visiting Disney at Anaheim.",2
"Disney allows TOO many people into the park. They clearly dodon't care about making the experience pleasant to the guest. They only care about money.I dodon't understand why they allow California residents to pay few dollars for an annual pass and flood the park at the expense if guests that pay full price. Clearly the California residents do not spend money at the park, they bring food and drinks from home and are significantly less profitable to Disney than out of state guests, yet allowing then to flood the park at the expense of other guests convenience naked no sense.In addition, given how expensive it is, Disney should do better job maintaining their equipment. Nearly one in every 3 rides wad either broken or broke while we were in line.Overall, our experience was not pleasant at all. We now refer to Disneyland as  The most miserable place in the world .We are done with Disney. Our vacation dollars will go much further somewhere else, where you dodon't have to spend 75% of your vacation time standing in line with sweaty people or spend 15 minutes in line to purchase a bottle of water for $4. Enough is enough.",2
"Considering the amount you pay, you spend most of the day in a line. On the day we went there were 12 rides not working and twice the rides stopped when we were in the line. I had a great southern stew at the French cafe in New Orlean sq but it is an expensive day. Also the fastpass system only allows one ride at a time so you are stuck in an area. The Disneyworld system is better for getting the most for your money",2
"We visited the park on April 23 which is supposed to be a moderate weekend for crowds. We arrived at 8 am, fortunately, which allowed us to ride about six rides by 10 am. After that, it was so crowded we could barely move. We held our six year old granddaughter's hand the entire time so she would not get lost or trampled by the crowds. Many lines past noon had 90 minute waits. We planned our day carefully and used the Fast Pass options which helped, but it was less than the Happiest Place on Earth for us. We saw a few characters during the day...Pluto, Mary Poppins and Bert...where were the rest? We logged our walking during the day and walked 10.7 miles by 5 pm, when we were too exhausted to walk any further. Fortunately our six year old was a trooper and enjoyed her day. We coulddon't bear the thought of the crowds for the evening events and went back to our hotel to swim in the relaxing pool...",2
"I love Disneyland, but my last experience with my twin, 8 year old nieces was not good. There were way too many people in the park and the lines were too long. We paid over $500 and only got on 3 rides during the entire day. They need to find a solution to this problem during the busy months, ",2
"Outrageously expensive and outrageously crowded. My teen enjoyed his final trip to Disneyland. The characters are fun, the few activities available that are not rides were fun, but the crowd and the prices are punishing. Maybe I'm just not a Disney sort of person, but you would think at some point the experience of not even being able to walk through a crowd would be a concern for safety, if nothing else.",2
"I have five members to my family and paying for D land is like having to leave them my first born. Way to expensive for us all to go. However, it was my son's B.day and he has never been to this theme park, so he and my husband went for a day of fun. They had an ok time, and would have had a better one if stuff was actually operational. My beef is with their greediness. ALOT of their rides were closed and yet they still charged full price for entry. Hmmmm how is it that we have to pay the same as someone who previously got to go on these rides but they are not made available to us for the same cost? The least they could have done is offer a two for one park pass at the cost of one park at least until all their stuff is operational again. It's too much $$$ for what you get now. Walt would not be so greedy.....I think I'll stick to Knott's Berry Farm. Good prices and they have rides you can actually go on.",2
"I haddon't been to the original Disneyland in 30 years and it was the first time I had taken our children there. We had been to EuroDisney a few years which we was not nearly as crowded. My son just wanted to go on the rides, but with lines up to 90 minutes, it's not a great experience for a 9 year old boy. As a foreigner I was surprised how 99% of the people in the park were white.",2
"Hi, coming from NZ we diddon't know what to expect, but whilst Disneyland was pretty, vibrant and busy. It diddon't hold much attraction to anyone that diddon't have a 3 to 8year old on their group. The rides, attractions , food , drink and shopping were definitely aimed at a younger market than our teenager. This could probably be emphasized by the management through some advertising. It was definitely in contrast to the older focus of Disney California Adventure just across from Disneyland which was much more suitable for us.",2
"So we were celebrating my sons 5th birthday it was his first trip to Disney and I have to say it was very disappointing. I am a 90's kid that grew up going to Disney world so it was my first trip to Disney land. There were no character we spend the day at the park and only got 2 autographs and that was after waiting over an hour to meet Mickey. We never seen Minnie Mouse, Donald, daisy or even Pluto. We did see goofy and got an autograph but when we seen chip and dale as we got to lineup we were told that they were leaving. This continues to happen all day. Wel left the park with only 2 sad signatures. I think the characters need to be more available to the travelers if they need to walk away and switch the person inside the suit to make people happy then they should or I am sure there is more than one goofy suit that one can go in back and another comes back out with in 5 min a kid would think oh he just went to change clothes because he was hot or dirty . All the time we were told no for an autograph really made me say I will not return to this park and would rather save for the longer trip to Florida for a GREAT experience. Our family had meme we travel from Chicago and Arizona for this trip and it was not a great experience. :(",2
Too crowded. Just getting around the park was difficult. Popular rides were booked out by 1 2pm and all other rides had huge queues. Coulddon't find many characters either.  Very expensive day and so sad to say....not enjoyable.,2
"Went to California for a much needed vacation and a birthday treat for my teenage son. I have been to both Disneyland and world several times so I feel I can review with accuracy. Each time I go prices up up and the service goes down. This time employees were rude especially staff at It's a Small World, bathrooms dirty out of toilet paper and towels, stores had shirts displayed but none available and my favorite a group smoking marijuana in the park smoking section. I actually told an employee about it and he said they were aware. I waited to see what happened NOTHING!! Lots of intoxicated guests as well from wine fest. Three different rides broke down while I wasdon't in line and they cleared out the lines. The topper was the fireworks being cancelled on the only night I could see them. Not the family experience I remember just a couple of years ago there. Long lines as always and fast passes gone for day buy 11 is always a great plus. Overall I have to say the Disney name no longer the quality I expected. This maybe my last visit. Two days almost two thousand dollars and got on 16 rides. I was there both days for almost the whole day.",2
"Fancy a visit to a theme park where you have to queue almost an hour for every ride? How about walking while saying  excuse me  every 2 min? That was our experience at Disneyland on a weekday in Spring which was not a school holiday. How crowded can it get during its peak season then?? The park is not big, if you take a walk around to just have a look it'll just take you an hour to see everything in the crowd. We only got to go on 4 rides as each time there was a queue of 45min. The other popular rides such as Its A Small World? Forget it! 75min! A photo with Mickey? 60min wait. It's just impossible to queue that long without small children getting impatient. We diddon't enjoy our visit due to the crowd but I think for little children it was still magical to see Mickey or a princess walking around. ",2
"Despite all the hype, Disneyland Park was hardly the magical place we were led to believe. We spent most of the day waiting in lines, and managed to get on only 7 rides over the course of 10 hours. Most of the rides were fairly disappointing, tending to be more jerky than thrilling. Space Mountain and Indiana Jones were two of the better ones, although neither was as much fun as an average roller coaster at most amusement parks. We visited Disney on a weekday, thinking the park would be less crowded, but the lines were regularly an hour or more long. The rides are not very reliable either, as both Space Mountain and Indiana Jones were unexpectedly shut down WHILE we were waiting in line. We left the line to ask for a FastPass to come back later, but the Disney staff would not issue these when the ride was down, saying this was the  policy . They told us we could either remain in line indefinitely, or return later and start at the back of the line again. We decided on the latter as no one could tell us when these rides would be operational again. In total, we waited over THREE hours in line just for those two rides. Unlike Universal Studios, which has a  Front of the Line  pass that you can purchase in advance and use on every ride, Disney has a  FastPass  system which is an absolute joke. These FastPasses are issued for one ride at a time, are not issued in a central location so you have to go to each ride to get one, cannot be acquired quickly (limits are roughly one per hour), and are issued for a ride several hours later in the day. We had two that were issued for after 10pm. I'm not sure which families are staying that late at an amusement park, but it certainly is not us. But hey, at least the FastPasses are free!The staff we encountered during our visit were not very friendly and only occasionally helpful. The food at the park was quite poor...no better than a school cafeteria, and worse than most fast food. Needless to say, we will not be returning to Disneyland Park anytime soon. If you're a family, save the money and go to the beach instead.",2
Our family visited Disneyland on 3 29. We purchased 2 day passes but decided not to return the second day. It was extremely crowded. Even with fast passes the waits were long. In 6 1 2 hours we were able to ride 4 rides. Would it kill Disney to provide some sort of entertainment while you are waiting in long lines? Maybe have some cast members visit with the children while they are in line? We saw lots of stressed out parents and children during our visit. Is Disneyland really the happiest place on earth?,2
"The wow factor is definitely there, but not in the positive way you would expect.....just needs some new leadership or something....kind of a mess. Like another reviewer said, I experienced the same disappointing results....long lines, multiple and constant breakdowns...seems like every time we turned around we saw a sign showing a ride was down....a couple times when we came with our Fastpasses, garbage, ripped fabric on canopies, dirty, unpainted, just appeared the  shine  was gone that i remember when I have been there as both a kid and a few years ago as an adult. Very discouraging, that we parked in what they call  overflow parking  in Simba parking lot and apparently our $18 to park doesdon't entitle you to a shuttle to take you back to your car, so we had to walk all the way back through downtown Disney and another 15 min with tired kids at the end of the night. We could have taken the monorail from Tomorrowland to Hotel Disney, which is close to the parking lot, but.....you guessed it, it was shut down due to technical difficulties. Multiple attractions shut down due to construction, including all island and river boats, jungle cruise, the train...no shows or programs to speak of...it was a week night evening...but it was Spring break and the crowds were intense...so, really? no shows in the large Fantasyland theater? The fireworks were cancelled due to wind...What? there was no wind that night? but I talked to other guests who said they had not had them for 3 nights. Dodon't go over Spring Break.....I can attest to that...although maybe if a few more people experience what we did, there wont be the crowds there in the future....but I'm not sure I want to experience what we did again....Did I mention it cost over 700 to take my wife, me and 4 of our kids to Disneyland for 1 day? So, they havedon't adjusted the prices downward, that's for sure....and did I mention they seem to have a significant number of places and shops you can spend money...they definitely havedon't spared any expense in the proliferation of this aspect of the park. We were excited to see what they had done for Star Wars and the new movie premier. Man, it just wasdon't what I expected...it seemed like they just patched a bunch of stuff onto existing rides to claim that things had been updated, but it was pretty much just the same old worn out rides, with a couple of added voiceovers, a new video clip added in somewhere. Captain EO is gone....that is good, it had overstayed its welcome when we came there before, but in its place is a movie called pathway to the force or something lame like that....just a bunch of clips strung together from the various Starwars movies, with a few red and blue light strobes accenting the action at various points? Really, Disney? What happened to you. Even the guy standing at the microphone was tired and un inspiring. He tried to tell a joke, nobody laughed and he said,  Well, I guess we just should start the movie....The theater was only about 1 4 full even though the park was full.So, it was a disappointment tonight for us this week. It lost the luster and really struck me as another one of the amusement parks we attend periodically, tending to become tired and overused as the owners get lazy in their efforts to keep rides relevant and lack the leadership to inspire that attention to detail, which in the past has always been Disney's Forte.",2
"I went to the park on a tuesday but it was a peak time. The park was so crowded you could not go anywhere without being pushed and shoved. The shops were so packed I could not see the merchandise. The lines were intense. I dodon't know if it is ever better, but when the cost to get in is over $100 per person I'm not going to try again.",2
"they let way to many people into the park at once. 90 min. wait on almost all rides even with the fast pass! it is a rip off to pay all that money and only get to ride 2 or 3 rides in a 9 hour day and walking over 5 miles to get to them only to learn you cant ride. long lines for EVERYTHING. tickets should be sold like a concert, so many on a certain date so everyone can enjoy the attractions! I will never return or visit any other Disney parks because of it.",2
"Expensive (recently increased prices again!), overcrowded (to the point of being dangerous if there were an emergency) & staff that mostly just diddon't look like they wanted to get there   this was the worst experience of Disney I've had.Being a regular of Disney World in Florida I recognise that I've gotten used to the experience there &a comparing the two is just like comparing chalk with cheese. Despite this, I've been to Disneyland several times & whilst never overawed this trip just failed miserably.The only reason I gave it two stars rather than one was for the quality of the firework display   very good   just not good enough to convince me to return with the family anytime soon. Shame on you Disney for not caring enough   so evident throughout the day.",2
It's Official..Disney is all about the money...as a second time season pass holder my family has experienced nothing but overwhelming overcrowding and wait times (yes..fast pass is useless also).  I and others that go to the park all say it's unsafe.  Reconsidering bringing Grandchildren to park.,2
Most of the rides at the park were closed and or under construction.  My granddaughter did not enjoy this trip to Disneyland.,2
"I just dodon't get the draw to Disneyland. My husband and I took our 7 year old for Spring Break. (Huge mistake, I know.) I wish I could say that it was a magical five days for us, but I just cadon't. Some parts of it were, but there are some huge issues that the Disney Corporation should really be forced to address. First, the entry. One morning, we got there at 8 and we're stuck in lines, waiting to get in, until 9. We wasted an our just trying to get into the park. Wr learned our lesson and slept in for the rest of our trip. All of the lines were so incredibly long, and it could have been solved by simply opening more entry stations. It's almost as if they want people to be miserably waiting in line because after you gain entry, that's pretty much all you do. Lines for rides were AT LEAST 30 minutes long. The majority are much longer. Second, the amount of strollers being pushed through the park is INSANE. I dodon't know how many times I was tripped and run into. It was horrifying. It's only compounded by the number of people inside the park. It's absolute mayhem. The whole experience feels like Disney was sucking money and life out of us. I cadon't get the time I wasted, standing in line for EVERYTHING, back. I feel foolish for allowing it. There are so many other ways to spend my time and money, instead of on the overpriced tickets, crappy food and gift shop junk from China, inside the park. This really could and should be a magical place for families, but it's not. It's shameful. Boooooo, Disney. Booooo!",2
"Paid a tidy sum for one day park hopper tickets. So glad that was all the money I wasted.How can it be claimed that this is the happiest place on earth?From the minute you enter the park   staff who search your bags. Well, they open them, cast a cursory glance inside and then wave you through. Do they have a clue what they're looking for or, like other Disney cast members, are they just playing the part?Wait to get in. Wait to get out. Waiting times well in excess of an hour for most of the rides. Fast pass tickets exhausted for most rides. Broken down rides. Rip off food and drink prices. Screaming, fractious kids   who are NOT having a happy time. Parents who havedon't a clue how to control them. Disney staff who herd the crowds like animals. Actually, many behave worse than animals and I lost count how many times I ripped into cheats who jumped the lines. Yep, spend sixteen hours in Disneyland and for your efforts get to experience half a dozen or so rides and a couple of stage shows. Come out feeling seriously swindled of your money, stiff and sore from standing in lines and with the mother of all headaches from the never ending noise.Do yourselves a favour. Experience Disney in Florida where the parks are bigger and better equipped to deal with the massive number of visitors. For health and safety reasons alone, there should be a maximum limit on the number of guests admitted to the parks. Never again.",2
"We went to Disneyland for my daughters birthday. We went on a Tuesday and it was extremely packed but the worst part was that it seemed things kept shutting down. We stood in line for Thunder Mountain and after 30 minutes in line we were notified it was shut down so we walked to Splash Mountain which was also shut down and they diddon't know when it would be up and running again. Through out the long day we only got to ride 4 rides. I was so disappointed and so was my daughter. With the prices being what they are for a ticket, it was not worth it. ",2
The fun went away when Walt Disney went away.   Everything is too expensive and there are too many people.,2
"I worked in South Florida for eight years and the work required me to visit Disney and other theme parks in Orlando on several occasions...so I knew they weredon't my cup of tea! We took our grandchildren to LA last week and felt obliged to shell out $400 for Disney Park tickets. What a shambles. The park is clean, the personnel are professional and pleasant and the rides work if you can get on them...but you cadon't. Standing in giant line ups we were surrounded by piped music, exposed to broiling sun and the less than charming aroma of fast food.I accept that millions of people seem to enjoy this although I am at a loss to understand why, so I will buy shares in Disney but I will never go back!",2
"The sea of people at Disneyland is SO CRAZY !! OMG !! They let way to many inside the park. We had a good time and made the best of it. Went on a few rides, most rides had a 1 2 hour wait but some had 15 30 min wait. You can still have fun, but at times it's just WAY TO MANY PEOPLE !! It's like being in a mosh pit at a concert. ! I love Disyland but !!!!!!!!!! ",2
"Let me start off by saying I was in Cali with my family visiting so disney was not the destination but we decided to take the kids. We went on Monday 3 7 during the afternoon. It was not crowded we actually got to go on every ride that was...open!There are alot of rides closed that they do not tell you about on the website and dont bother calling either because you wont find out that way. We did however enjoy the rides we got to go on. The peter pan ride was the highlight of my visit its worth the line wait. The food and drink price are what you expect of an amusement park so it didnt seem over the top expensive to me just what I would expect being at an amusement park. The workers seemed nice I really didnt interact with them that much except to ask where certain rides were and they were helpful. It did start to get crowded around 7pm and im guessing because the locals got out of work school. The one thing that made me hate disneyLAND was the paint the night parade. Not the parade itself that was simply phenomenal but how they allow the crowds to gather towards the end and follow mickey, let me tell you that you CANNOT walk through the crowd to leave the park. Some idiot actually tried to trample my stroller because we were trying to leave and were walking in the opposite direction. It was so unsafe it was scary I had to bring out the  New York  in me and push him then yell for everyone to get the F out of the way so me and my kids can get through. It put a bad taste in my mouth for the end of the night and my 5 year old was scared. Disneyland is smaller than disneyworld I mean really there is no comparison. It shouldnt even be called disney because you dont get that  magical  feeling that you get at disneyworld. Im glad this destination was just a stop and not the reason we came out there or I would be ever so pissed.",2
"Fast passes help, but walking back and forth across the park only to find that Splash Mtn closed once again temporarily just after it reopened, but no thanks. Disneyland is amazing, but it is a lot of work for the few rides attractions that we did. Recommend using the app, which we did, that way you can plan better.",2
"It was Disneyland. You expect certain things. We had breakdowns on almost every ride. C'mon Disney. Been going there since the 60's, never been more disappointed!FIX THE RIDES! With as much money as they make you would think they would take better care of their park! ",2
"We visited here in February 2016 on a day when the locals should be in school ! What a joke ! There were so many children here on the Tuesday we went, it was inbelievable. The queues for the characters was ridiculous and very badly organised. We queued on a very hot day outside for well over an hour just to get a photo with Minnie ! Several rides were closed. In Florida Disney Park, they have covered or sheltered walk ways for queues   this place has NOTHING. You have to stand in the sweltering heat. The evening was a nightmare, when the locals, who buy cheap 'yearly' tickets for this place bombard it. The place gets dangerously crowded and we simply could not move when the electric light parade and fireworks were on. I was travelling with a disabled person with a wheelchair, and the evening was really frightening trying to get through the crowds. The staff are not very helpful   even at one time being told to take the wheelchair to an enclosure, just to be told by another to leave !! There is NO CROWD control at all. They let in far too many people. This place should be about FUN. They make it about MONEY. I would definitely NOT recommend this park   go to Hollywood Universal Studios instead.Visited February 2016",2
"Our 3rd time and it was one of the worst. We will go to Disney World in FL only from now on.There were not enough people around to help assist in directions or keeping lines defined and moving. Lines were spilling out into the the walk paths and people were complaining that they were there all day, left and came back and had only been on 2 rides. Getting fast passes was a real inconvenience. We spent our time in line coming up with ideas on how to fix what we did not like about the whole process. I think there should be some undercover boss's going through the park with their families and friends for a week to get an idea of how the park is really working. There were groups of kids and people on tours and although they tried to stay to the side and out of the way it was really impossible. We were very disappointed because the park felt chaotic and the few employees we did see were overwhelmed and we felt bad for them. They stayed happy and helpful but you could see it was a really intense day for them. The prices are way to high for the experience and that was disappointing as well. For the price of admission the rides were okay and even though we expected the food and merchandise to be expensive it was ridiculously so and the quality not always the best. We feel that Walt would not be happy that his dream is no longer as it was intended. We did not feel like guests but more like a heard of suckers. The best part was watching the people dressed up that were not part of Disney. And they say Portland is Weird.",2
My son and I have wanted to go for so long to Disney land. Who new the expensive prices also came with REDUCED HOURS in February 10 to 8 normal is till 12. The fire works were canceled every night we were their along with the world of colour at the other park. Many of the rides were closed including the who area of Tom Sawyer which was one of the ones we had waited to go see!! 25 % to 50% of the rides or areas were closed in each area!! NO REDUCED PRICE!! Wrote to Disney and no reply back to explain. If you are a Canadian the cost is very expensive. It would have been acceptable if the sites I looked which were many let you know about not going in February as substantial reduced times and no reduced cost!! Takes the fun out of this magical place. They must be desperate for money!! ,2
"It was my first time in disney land with my daughter, wife and my mom, we spend 600 $ and this is our experience:WORST, HORRIBLE DAY in our life, maybe this place was cool 60 years ago but now it looks very poor, everything so expensive, staff rude, rides always breaking down, huge queues, I cant even describe how bad and poor was this park in Los Angeles, We will not go there again even if they will pay for our plane tickets from Australia.I dreamed to go to disneyland, now I hate disneyland. WORST PARK IN THE WORLD.NOT WORTH MONEY OR TIME. Really do not recommended.",2
I've been coming to disney land every 2 years since i was 7 years old and each time I've noticed the security isdon't very determined to keep the park safe. You pass the part were they check your bags then you have the choice to go straight or through security and each time they stopped us and make all of us go through even the kids and at first i use to think okay i get that they want to make sure no one gets through hiding any weapons i really like that they have security reach until i noticed they mostly only stop dark skinned people letting the light skinned just walk on by and i thought maybe it's because they diddon't see them until i seen the security look directly at them then look at us and come walking toward us. If you've noticed this happened one too many times please comment and write more reviews we are very hurt and dodon't think anyone else should feel this way. None of us should be treated any different because of our race. We are equal and we shoulddon't be treated any different from others.,2
"If you are thinking of going here or to the park in Florida, here's a head's up. GO TO FLORIDA instead. Disneyland in California has been ruined by horrible overcrowding due the overselling of their annual passes. This place is no longer for tourists who might want to enjoy the old Disney magic once or twice a year. It's for the pass holders who want go to the park once or twice a week all year long. About 20 or 30 million people live within a two hour drive of this park and a large percentage of them have season passes. You would think that with all the recreational and entertainment options in Southern California these people would have something better to do than go to Disney once a week to stand in hour long lines to go on the same ride for the 1,000th time. You would be wrong.You used to be able to go this place during the week on a school day and it woulddon't be horribly overcrowded. Not anymore. Here's a rundown of the wait times I encountered today on a Tuesday in February (school day) after I was suckered into buying a three day ticket recently with the SoCal discount. Arrived at the entrance gate 75 minutes before the so called  magic hour  as recommended on their website (hotel guests and 3 day or more ticket holders get in an hour before regular opening time on certain days.) At 7:45 AM the line for every single entrance gate is already 200 plus people long. Takes 25 minutes just to get in the front gate with pre printed tickets. So 10 minutes of the not so magic hour already gone.Go to recently renamed Hyper Space Mountain (basically same ride with a few new sound effects) and the line was already 15 minutes. Note that this is still 45 minutes before the park officially opens for the day. Turns out that would be as good as it gets all day. The next ride is Star Tours, line is already 30 minutes. Keep in mind this is still 30 minutes before the park even officially opens. So 2 rides and the  magic hour  is gone. Now it's 9:10 and I immediately fast pass Space Mountain since I'm right next to it and the fast pass system opened 10 minutes ago. Reserved ride time is 11:50 AM. It's already a three hour wait for fastpass and the park officially opened ten minutes ago. I weep for the suckers who bought a one day ticket for 100 bucks and are still waiting in the line to get in at what they thought was the park opening.Next up, Matterhorn Bobsled ride at 9:15 AM. Wait time 40 minutes. It's now 10. Next ride, Indiana Jones. 45 minute wait time. It's now 11. Get lunch at Pizza port for me and my wife for 30 bucks and walk around the new Space Port exhibit to kill time for my fast pass return at Space Mountain. Hmm, you can buy a Darth Vader costume for 4 grand or a storm trooper outfit for 2 grand. No, I'm not kidding. Not surprisingly 3 cashiers sit around looking bored as nobody is buying their overpriced junk. After having a few laughs at how ridiculous Disney has become I go back for my one fast pass ride. I'm done for the day at noon. By 11 AM Disneyland was so horribly overcrowded it was like a zombie horror film with the undead wandering the narrow paths menacingly. Strollers shoved into wheelchairs who knocked over old people on walkers, who were then trampled by the stampeding hoards wearing mouse ears. Every once in a while a speeding scooter would flatten out the fallen. I can still remember a day about 7 years ago when I went here midweek in September after Labor Day and every ride had no longer than a ten minute wait. Thanks to corporate greed and the annual pass system those days are long, long gone. Do yourself a favor and stay away until the annual passes are discontinued. The people who pay 100 dollars for a day ticket here are literally being robbed blind and getting very little value in return.",2
"One of the most boring experiences of my long life. This park is a shoppers dream but, lacks any substance. Both Disneyland and California Adventure Park are so full of touristy shops selling t shirts that they almost forgot to include any attractions. Some of the lines for rides were hours long. Certainly not this girl's cup of tea.",2
"Our family travels to Disneyworld in Florida 3 times a year for a week each trip. We love it and in WDW everything runs smoothly, even when lines do hit peak times. We were in LA this January for business reasons and went to Disneyland with my youngest (11) just because a. it is Disney, b. it is an amusement park and c. we were in the area. Well, let's say it is an under amusement park, the rides are almost the same as the ones we love in Florida but with crappy surroundings, cranky and poorly dressed (time to buy new uniforms!) cast members, no music, no festive atmosphere. It barely feels Disney, and it does not begin to feel  magical . As my daughter put it, she wanted to leave after 2 hours in the park (and the day we visited the lines were ok):  this is like what would look like if you were having a very bad dream about Magic Kingdom . I dodon't get how so many people still love Disneyland, I honestly feel bad about them since they are obviously deprived of fun choices or seeing the place clouded in their memories of the past or obviously we dodon't get it and they do. But for us to even begin to enjoy this place, they would have to make a major clean sweep in this park (trash sits everywhere), hire and train happy people, give them a nice, new looking uniform, put music and events in the park, fix the potholes, clean up their act with fast passes, buy new umbrellas and park fixtures, train the personnel at Town Hall, open new table service restaurants, add a Main Street  smell , and so on. No wonder the two parks are managed by totally separated companies   who ever Disney hires to maintain and manage this park should be let go, and bring in the big guns from Florida.",2
"The Indiana Jones ride broke down, right as we were going down a fast, incline. As the car jerked to a stop, my lap restraint tightened up and left no slack on my lower abdomen. It was extremely tight and cutting into me. We waved at the cameras for help and even yelled for help. No one came. We were stopped for about 10 minutes and no one came. When the car finally started, I had to ride the ride out in absolute pain. When we finally got close to the exit and in sight of the ride operator, Tara, we yelled for help. She rudely told me that I would have to wait, turned around, and walked away. When I started to yell for help even louder she looked at me laughing. I was crying at this point and traumatized. She never asked me if I was OK. She never said sorry. I was upset and a supervisor Kevin came. He was not very sympathetic, nor did he ever ask if I was OK. He said that this experience would  make for a good talking point at their next meeting.  I was so angry I walked all the way to City Hall guest relations to file a formal complaint. Grace did her job by offering me tissue, water, and a FastPass good for any ride, anytime for our party. Not sure what is going to happen to Tara or the person who was supposed to be responsible for watching the cameras, but I would like to know that the consequence was going to be more than a  good talking point  at their next meeting. What a disgrace to the Disney name! ",2
"Bought entry and parking online before we went. Thought & read it is easier & cheaper  WRONG! Could it find the parking, many others had to take a U turn to find it too. Not labeled well at all! Finally found something and parked. Disneyland was great, 1st time for the kids, came out to pay for parking & we were in the wrong lot for the pass we had, had to pay again! Ugh! They need much better signage for just getting there once on Disney property!",2
"Saying  I hate Disneyland  feels like an evil that should not be spoken aloud. But here it is. We visited during the week, in February, because we read that the crowds are smallest at this time. While this may be true, the place is still the busiest place I've ever been, except for India. No, seriously, By the weekend, there was a soul destroying lineup to simply get through security, just so that you could get into the life sucking lineup to actually get into the park so that you could cram yourself through the mortifying crowds to line up for EVERY SINGLE thing. Kids were crying, melting down everywhere, parents were trying to pretend they were happy that they spent $100 each to do this, and on that last morning, I felt only dread and actual horror at the prospect of going in. Thank god for California Adventure Park, shining like an oasis on the opposite side. Once through the security line, we surveyed the gross, gross line to Disneyyland and our 6 and 8 year olds both said  I'm not goin' in THAT! , so we headed across the way to California Adventure, with no line to get in whatsoever. While the attractions are pretty amazing, both parks have the same thing going on to control the crowds outside each one   wrap the line, accordion style, in and out of walls that will both hide the hideous lineup from view, and keep it tightly controlled so as not to block the walkways though Disneyland. I understand this, but thought it was also pretty deceptive, because honestly, one look at the ACTUAL lineup for those attractions in its full glory would make you turn and run for the hills! While I appreciate the quality of the attractions, I just am not happy to wait minimum 20 minutes for each one. The most popular can be 90 minutes plus waiting time. California Adventure was better on this front as we seemed to breeze in and out of most things, but I truly think that was blind luck, right time, right place. By breeze in and out, I mean  wait only 5 15 minutes per attraction , btw. People rave about Fast Passes, but for the 5 or 6 attractions that actually give them in each park, letting you rapidly enter between appointed times, you can only hold a couple at once, so you certainly cadon't rely on this method all day long. When we wanted lunch, even the restaurants had 40 minute waits. And that was at 11:00! I get that you can  strategize  your day to  maximize  your time. But when I'm on vacation, no thanks. FACT: no matter what, you're going to spend 90% of your day walking from lineup to lineup, and waiting in line. This was my assumption going in, but no one who has been said it out loud. I am saying it out loud!",2
We went here filled with excitement and had high expectations to be overwhelmed with joy after being told it is the  happiest place on earth . The park was absolutely packed when we arrived and we had to wait almost an hour to get parked and in the front gate. There hardly any thrilling rides or anything which was worth the 1 hour plus wait times so we spent the majority of the day walking around battling the insane crowd. All of the staff had fairly monotonous personalities and there wasdon't a whole lot to see and do so we left after a few hours only. Universal Studios was so much better and a lot cheaper. Disneyland would probably only be good for little children.,2
"Maybe my husband and I are missing the magical gene but I am sorry folks the happiest place on earth is a bit overrated. If we did not have a young child this place would not even be on the radar for a vacation. It's not about the money but when your spending what you spend to get through the gates the rides better be working and the cast members better have a Ms USA smile smothered on their faces all day. The food is horrible, out of the 100 s of staff members maybe 10 smiled. The lines to get on rides is ridiculously long the wait time horrible. And the magical fast pass helps a bit. We visited during a slow time of the year I cadon't imagine during the summer busy months. Even my 6 year daughter was over it   I asked her what she will remember from this  magical  visit   she answered with waiting in line. Really not what I expected. ",2
"We visited Disneyland in January with our eight year old son. My summary of the experience is:  ticket prices are prohibitively expensive, particularly if you have more than one child  the park itself if VERY, VERY crowded. We deliberately chose a  quiet day on a quiet week  and it was still ridiculously crowded. Wait times on rides ranged up to 70 minutes which is just crazy. Clearly the number of annual pass holders clog up the park making it way too busy  the rides themselves are old, old, old and need to be updated  food at the park is poor quality and expensive  if you choose to go, learn the fast pass system before you enter the park as this is somewhat helpfulWe would not recommend a visit to Disneyland.",2
we took out 5 and 6 year old boys to disney and we got there both times when the park opened. I was running from one ride to another strategically planning how to get a fast pass and not have the kids wait in line for so long. not every ride has a fast pass so.....at one point we waited in line for 90 mins for a ride. the food was not that great there thank god we packed snacks and overall I was disspointed b c we did not get one single picture w  a character. the lines each time were sooo long it was unreal. why would you have this so long for impatient kids? The adults that were visiting the parks were very inconsierate of children and my son got trampled while I was holding his hand and hit w  bags b c his short. for goodness sakes ppl there are little kids here have some sense. ,2
"Overall our experience was disappointing. Because several kid friendly rides were closed, wait times at other rides were 90 120 minutes. Then Star Tours broke down. In addition, the Mexican restaurant had no working heaters on the patio. They claimed that  maintenance  had to relight them, but no one was called. ",2
The park itself is beautiful however there were so many people at the park it was difficult to enjoy the day as we had to battle against the crowds constantly. Staff are mostly nice and helpful.,2
"Imagine paying $7.80 for a corn dog. Yes, a corn dog cooked 45 minutes before your arrival and barely warm on eating. Expand this to your experience. Thought you were clever buying a hotel room at a stupid ridiculous price for early entry? HA HA HA! Only 1 5 of the park is open to you and the other dumb buyers (like me). Get in line, get in line, get in line. Weredon't those Halloween Decorations cool in the photos? HA! They are 20 years old and have been baking in the California sun since then. This is a date park that has to answer to corporate money and there are not too many investments in the park, save for patting down folks in wheelchairs. Sell, sell, sell, Buy, buy, buy. Take your kids somewhere else. Make a new fantasy. Disney is over. Jeep is selling ads on TV now for Disney Star Wars. ",2
"visited this park during rosebowl time only because it was an outing offered to our group, which was a high school band. i expected crowdes but not the gazillion pople we were faced with. It was hard to even walk thru the park and in the end we gave up trying and took the train back to the entrance. The characters were'nt really visible and the staff did not trade any pins with the children. The lines were beyond long so my advice is if you go please do so in an off peak season disney here in cali need to step up their customer service as they lag sorely behind orlando (go there instead). i didnt have high expectations since we had no little kids in our group but it would have been nice to be able to at least get on its a small world Geez!",2
"I love Disneyland and am glad to go on any day but New Year's Eve. Friends who go every year assured us that  it's great!  But it's not. It was so crowded that we only got on 3 rides in 14 hours at the park. And the flow of human traffic is extremely frustrating. We waited 45 minutes in a shuffling mass of people to get through an intersection at Frontierland. Also, and this is not Disneyland's fault, we waited until midnight to see the fireworks only to have them cancelled due to high winds. Disappointing.",2
"It was crowded, but that was not the problem. The way you are treated and herded around by the employees is my beef. When the shows or after parades are finished, you are ushered away, and can not stop to view the fireworks. The employees wave their flashlights in your face, and will not allow you to enter a roped off area to view the show. With the cost of admission at over 100 dollars they should be more accommodating.",2
"The crowds between Christmas and New Year's make for a bad experience. Took an hour just to get into the park. I would love to know max capacity vs. Universal Studios, because we did more in one hour at Universal than we did in 10 hours at Disney.Cast members are always running somewhere and spend little to no time with their fans. At Universal, we got pictures with numerous cast members and spent only seconds to a few minutes in line for each of those pics.",2
"Every little girl dreams of going to the most magical place on earth, but sadly for me this was close to a nightmare. No Characters roaming around, the crowds were unheard of. The staff look like someone just stole there candy, they were not helpful at all and when someone did go out of there was to assist us in a place to sit one and a half hours before the parade someone else came up just before the parade and said we could not sit there so we ended up in a shocking position thanks to the staff not knowing simple things. The Toilets were disgusting the food was not even worth writing a review. It was the worst memory of our month long holiday and this was what we were looking forward to the most.",2
"Beware of the ridiculous crowds. We arrived at Noon and were only able to ride 3 attractions all day! It was a sea of people everywhere.How can they do this to us? They're selling annual passes like hotcakes and obviously just dodon't give a damn that it's creating record crowds. And, yes, it's Disneyland and people are going to keep coming no matter what they do. : (I dodon't think Mickey really loves us after all, but he still loves our $!",2
"We started out at the haunted mansion and the line went fairly quickly although we waited for an hour. Everywhere you go, the walkways were blocked off because the lines from the rides spilled out. Was there seven hours and got on three rides.  Hyperspace  mountain as it is now called, was the longest line I've waited in my whole life. Two hours pass and we were still only halfway through the line. The people that work there were trying their best to entertain the kids in the center with hopscotch and such so I applaud them for trying. The parade congested things up and we would have to go around the whole park or wait for a break in the parade. Definitely dodon't want to come back during Christmastime.",2
"We've been here for 3 hours. We have been in 3 lines and kicked out of 2 for techical difficulties. We are waiting for ride  4 which, if we have any luck, will be the first ride we get on. A lot of rude people shov I ng their way through and the fast pass is a joke. ",2
"It's been about 5 years since we visited Disneyland. I remember all those times before were magical and fun, it made is want to come visit every time we were in LA. After yesterday's visit on Christmas Day. Never again! The park was over crowded by 10am it was at maximum capacity and times to go in were over 3 hours. We had a hopper pass and decided to visit California Adventure first. By noon when we wanted to visit Disneyland we weredon't able to go in. It want till 4pm that we were able to enter the park. Once we did it was horrible it was hard to walk, waiting lines for rides were ridiculously long. I think from now on I'll stick to Disney World. ",2
"Have been 6 times to Disneyland Park since 1999 and never had I had such poor experience at Disneyland Park even during Christmas time. This time was different, and I am turned off enough not to go there again. Very crowded, rides do not open on time or keep closing due to technical difficulties, the management team on the ground is clearly overwhelmed by the overcrowding at the park, particularly visible during parade times. While we took advantage of the magic morning to get into the park early, the day we went had Splash mountain, Hyperspace mountain and Matterhorn bobsled all open late due to technical difficulty. Haunted house had to close temporarily due to technical difficulty while we were right at the top of the line. Tomorrow Land has Star Wars ride and Super hero exhibits and has barely space to walk. A few food comments as usual:Compared to the non vegetarian options, the veggie food options are pathetic. On Main Street you get Pretzels, New Orleans area has cold Salad, if you are by the Splash mountain and hungry you get fries. There are very few decent veggie meal options and long walks to get to any of those decent options: Veggie skewers at Adventure Land at Bengal Barbecue, cold sandwich at tomorrow land, cheesy pizza at tomorrow land, and burger at fantasyland. Veggie skewers are hit or miss, some of the veggies were not grilled fully and were half baked. Certainly adding veggie hot meal options that are easily accessible in many restaurants across the park would be good. In summary, compared to all my past visits, this visit made me feel the magical experience is fading. Very commercial experience. Mickey I feel seems to be taking the foot steps of Scrooge McDuck, so very much a good bye from me. ",2
"crowdy, old attractions, kids decided to skip attraction not to stay in lines, attractions in movable parks are essentially more interesting than there",2
"This may be our last trip to Disneyland. Definitely not the most happiest and magical place on earth. The crowds are horrible. You can only get one fast pass every 2 hrs and lines are 90 minutes wait time. No thx. In some areas, you cant even make it thru the walkways because of people. You are packed in like sardines everywhere. No characters out and if they are, the line is cut off after just a few people. Nothing like a screaming kid after standing in line 15 minutes to see goofy and being told the end of line is right in front of you. The staff are far from friendly. A lot of them seem to hate their jobs. No smiles! They should limit the amount of people in or something. Its just ridiculous. Not worth the money it takes for a vacation to Disneyland. Will take a cruise next time! Mickeys Toon Town cannot be safe with all the people crammed in their. Couldnt even enjoy it. Once again, was told Minnie Mouse was done visiting after standing in line 35 minutes. Really!!! ",2
"I love Disneyland. So does my Autistic daughter. Disneyland has changed their handicap policy, because of evil people who abused it. Now you need to go to a kiosk and request a ride. They scan your ticket and tell you when to show up at that attraction. Wait times can be as long as an hour. In the meantime, you cannot ride any other rides as your ticket is locked into the one you requested. If you stand in the line you can, but if you are in a wheelchair or a scooter and try to access handicap line they tell you that you have to wait until your first ride is finished..so for that hour, you are pretty much sitting there waiting. One day at Disneyland and we were able to ride 4 rides. The second day we hired a V.I.P for $400.00 an hour. Yep, you heard me right. $400.00 an hour. And you have to have a minimum of 6 hours. $2400.00 for my family to be able to ride more than 4 rides. Two of the rides we went on were 45 minute waits even with the VIP guide. And both of those rides closed down just as we we getting to the front of the line. Two hours wasted. We were refunded one hour, so at least we weredon't that upset. I dodon't advise a VIP guide, as nothing about it made my family feel Very Important. No bottle of water, munchies or even straight to the front of the line. In fact..WE bought our guide lunch. So..sorry Disneyland. This family that has come every year for the last 20 years, will NO longer be patrons. Until you change your handicap policy, for the better and not for the worse, my money will be spent elsewhere. You might have shut down the scammers, but you made it impossible for those that truly need the handicap services to enjoy your park.",2
"Prices are high, crowds are bigger than ever , lines are longer than ever, food is worse than ever in the park, to put it simply , the magic is gone . To pay 240.00 for two days for the chance to be trampled by parents running with their little ones tucked in strollers when early entry into the park starts. Not to mention when there is early entry at Disneyland , there were only 2 parts of the park opened, Fantasy Land and Tomorrow Land. The other parts open at 9AM when there is the second running of the strollers. I can not imagine if they had to evacuate the park in an emergency what would happen. Disney seems only concerned about how many butts they can pack into the park.On the plus side the water shows at night in California Adventure were amazing. Restaurants will not let you check in for your reservation no more than 10 minutes prior to your time.MAKE RESERVATIONS FOR ALL DINING IN THE PARK, EVEN FOR BREAKFAST. YES , EVEN FOR BREAKFAST!!!!I have been coming to the park since 1979 and have never had a worker be short or rude to guests. This time it happened 3 times. I do believe it had to happen sooner or later, the amount of people that are at the park would even try the patience of a saint.Good bye Disney , I knew you well.",2
"My wife and I only have one day at each park. So I booked us this tour for the morning of our Disneyland Park day.We did not have a magical time. We had a pretty slow group and we only got to go on 3 rides during our tour. The tour went from 9:45 (people showed up late and we we told to be there at 9:15) until after 2pm. Over four hours and only three rides.I knew most of the history already so the tour itself wasdon't that great for me. When this would be worth it:*If you have at LEAST 3 days in the parks OR come here regularly throughout the year.*If you come regularly and want a SE Disney Pin*If you want a relaxing day and dodon't care about rides or waiting for things.*You REALLY want to see inside the dream suiteWhen this is not worth it:*If you only have one day per park. We missed out on a bunch of rides because the length of the tour.*If you LOVE rides and dodon't really care that much about history*If you have kids. Kids we were with HATED is and were so bored.We did not even go near Club 33 and diddon't see Walt's apt or ride in the train.Long Story Short...I liked the tour in general (because I LOVE all things Disney) but it wasted a lot of our day and we missed a bunch of rides because of it...oh, and we went in early Nov when the crowds are much lighter...",2
I am from the 2nd most populated country in the world and yet I have never seen so many people crammed together in one place.May be It could have been a good experience had there been a limited crowd. I hated it. I strongly think there should be a limit to admitance in the park. Else there is no point visiting this place.,2
"If your one of the locals and you think that going to Disneyland on Halloween might be fun......please rethink this. It was so overly crowded that we coulddon't move on Main Street. Although the park is incredibly decorated, I'll wait to see it during their off hours in the week from now on. ",2
"We came from out of state for the Halloween Party, a special event for us as we have always wanted to visit the Haunted Mansion with Jack Skellington in residence.That was a great moment, seeing the mansion and the ride was fabulous.The crowds were massive on a Friday night, especially between 4 7pm when the daytime visitors are in the park and the doors open for the party goers. There are rope lines set up to help with lines into the rides and handing out candy. With the crowds as huge as when we went, we watched as people were blocked off by massive crowds on one side and no way to get out due to the crazy rope lines on the other, people started to panic down by the haunted mansion area, going under the rope lines to escape and only to get berated by park employees for  cutting in line  , ridiculous! It took 45 minutes to get a bag of popcorn, the soda we waited 15 minutes to buy ran out of syrup. We had dinner at the Blue Bayou and had to wait a half an hour beyond our reservation time. The Pirates ride, Thunder Mountain AND Indian Jones ALL broke down at the same time in the same area of the park, that did not help with crown control AT ALL. The young people working in the park are simply not trained to handle crowds like this either. Customer service overall slips, as everyone appears to fall into survival mode including employees. It was crazy, we left early. Conversely, we have had a GREAT time at the Halloween party in WALT DISNEY WORLD.We all came away thinking this park is too small for these size crowds, and that the customer service in general was not even close to being on par with what we have always received in Florida. This visit hurt our perception of the Magical Disney experience, big time. We are hoping this is a one off event, but it has tarnished our feelings about Disney overall, believe it or not. We are DVC members, we love going to WDW in Florida. We just cadon't get over how California Disney leadership and management diddon't plan better. You know, it's like this is not supposed to happen at a Disney park. You are supposed to feel safe, happy and carefree. Yikes!",2
"We were excited to be at Disneyland over Halloween weekend and looked forward to the decorations and excitement. We have never been during a peak season. It certainly was eye opening...First of all   we got 2 day park hopper tickets and because they were 2 day we ALL had to have our picture taken. WHY? Well, the cast member recited his lines perfectly about how it was to  protect  us in case we lost our tickets and someone else tried to use them.  Really , I said    so if we lose our tickets do you invalidate them and issue new ones? .  No.  This conversation went around in circles for about 2 minutes until I finally got him to admit that the REAL reason they MUST take your picture is to make sure you dodon't give sell your ticket to someone else. Nice.... BTW   you HAVE NO CHOICE. You MUST have your picture taken or they will not allow you in. Each person is linked to a ticket   yes, EVEN THE KIDS. And when you re enter, be sure you have the right person with the right ticket or you wodon't get in.Lines were outrageous and people working were crabby and generally unfriendly.Indiana Jones ride broke twice in the same day. Space Mountain also broke down. Tomorrowland future building is closed for a year to renovate it.FASTPASS tickets were a joke   more so, if you get a FASTPASS for certain rides you cannot get one for a different ride until you actually USE the first one.... such as Space Mtn and the Star Wars 3D ride.I guess the most upsetting thing was how DIRTY the park was. We have been here 4 times over the past 8 years and it has NEVER been dirty. NEVER. There were always people cleaning with rags, sweeping, etc. There were papers, food, gum, all kinds of things ALL OVER THE PARK and we only saw ONE person in the two days we were there that was sweeping. Very disappointing. Walt would be ashamed.We were travelling with grandparents in their 70s and at one point they just could not walk anymore. They showed their handicapped state issues cards to access the Haunted Mansion and it took 2 people to come over and be both rude and uncompassionate to tell them they had to walk ALL THE WAY back to the front to the main building to get a pass. They issues a FASTPASS and said to return in an hour   but it was apparently a big inconvenience for them.The next day they went directly to the Main Building to get a  pass . They were told that unless they rented a wheel chair they could not be assisted. More so, they were told by a cast member that it was a  park and you should expect to walk around a lot and wait on line if you are here . Nice. Very nice. Luckily we were with them and the grandkids had us to run around with them. But tell me, does this mean that grandparents are no longer welcome into Disneyland with their grandchildren unless the kids (regardless of age) push the grandparents around in wheel chairs? Completely unacceptable. I do realize that people abused the privilege and were hiring people to go to Disneyland with them to get line passes, but please.... these people are in their mid70s.... this wasdon't a joke. Shame on Disney.I guess like all things, it has become completely and totally commercialized and the care and interest in making it a fun, family friendly, clean experience has passed. It's a business. And it has succumbed to the  make money  no matter what it takes mentality.... Sad thing   we were treated better and enjoyed Knotts Berry Farm more... now THAT says a lot.",2
"Let me first say that I have held annual pass three other times in my life and I have been coming here since I was a child. I love Disneyland and I waited to write this. My experience this last October was NOT GOOD. First of all it took almost 45 min. to park. Apparently coming early doesdon't pay off anymore because they make you drive around the whole park to some place on the other side of Harbor BLv. I PAID for parking pass and wanted the structure. When I questioned this, the attendant was rude. I bought a day hopper for my developmentally disabled brother who wanted to go with us. They DID NOT TELL ME THEY WOULD KICK US OUT AT 6:30 and SHOVE US OVER TO California Adventure ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE who did not have the special $70 green bracelet!!!! THEY kept yelling at us to move along, MOVE ALONG, and to not go this way or that way. I felt like i was a second rate customer being treated like dirt. IT was SO OVERCROWDED at California Adventure!! They said it would take an HOUR AND A HALF just TO ORDER FOOD!! My brother got to go on five rides between two parks for 150 bucks. I went to Pirates three times and they kept shutting it down. The ride was not broken and the attendant was rude to us. Haunted house left us standing at a stand still in the sun for 45 min. I think they were setting up for all the people who paid the extra 70 buck for their Halloween stuff. I left upset. I have never experienced such a bad day at this place.",2
"80% of the time is spent in lines. Considering the high cost of the tickets, it's just not worth it anymore. Also, the only food in Disneyland that is good is at the Belle Cafe. Everything else is overpriced and not tasty. We are so disappointed.",2
"So...the last time I came to Disneyland Park was nearly 20 years ago and have fond memories of the place. Much has changed since then and I decided to come again the day before Halloween, perhaps that was my biggest mistake. We arrived at 1PM and it was unbelievably crowded, judging from the research I've done after the visit, I guess this Park attracts more locals and it seemed that way. Wait times were at least 40   50 minutes all around and Fast Passes were 5 hours   and desperate to just get out of one area, we decided to brave a 50 minute wait for a specific ride (Indie Jones).Now, granted the line does move so you're not really standing still for a long period of time. That I have to give them credit for doing a good job.So the above mentioned are things neither I nor Disney have much control over (apart from when I choose to visit). Here is what I was disappointed about:1) I understand that rides get updated but there were a couple of updates that detracted from the rides   Indiana Jones   I remember there used to be a boulder rolling towards us in the end and the train would seem to hurtle towards it before dropping and that was the end of the ride. Now, no boulder but you still have Indie hanging from up there and I diddon't understand a word he said. Very anti climactic.2) Haunted Mansion has gone completely Tim Burton's Nightmare before Christmas now and towards the end there used to be a holographic mirror you went by and there would be a ghoul or grizzly seated beside you, now I had a roll of Christmas wrapping paper? Someone else had Dr. Zeuss' hat? What?!3) The employees were SOUR!! Whatever happened to the Happiest Place on Earth? You'd think they were working in the Most Miserable Place on Earth. They were not of good cheer, friendly, they were chatting amongst themselves and herding cattle.4) Speaking of herding cattle, hey at least entertain us while we're waiting in line especially when the waits get pretty up there like 50, 75, 80 minutes long. A person or two coming out to entertain or talk to us in character of the ride would work? I think Club Med does a better job at that...I kinda feel like I dealt with a bad pimp during my visit   they took my money, under delivered, and diddon't care about my experience. Now, I've never been to a pimp, but I'm just saying'...We did have reservations at the Blue Bayou for lunch and that was good. No complaints there.But after 6 hours we still had not finished our rides in Adventureland and Critter Country and the riff raft was ballooning, I threw in the towel and headed back to the hotel for a glass of champagne instead.Maybe I'll try again on a rainy weekday in January away from any holidays or events...",2
"Went there with family for one day, few attractions was closed for renovations and some closed because technical issues such as Submarine Nemo ( electrical problem) and also Winnie the Poo during queuing we has been announced delay because technical problem...again! I found this Disney park poorly maintain compared to the one in Hong Kong or Paris. We paid more than 500$ for a family of 5 and seriously it's not worth it at all!!Staff service is average, most of food proposed is over priced and poor quality.Well for me I will say Disney is not made to have happy family but to robe family!Honestly spend your money traveling with your kids on the beach or visit natural parks, this is cheaper and more fun!!One positive, carpark over there is good...but cost you 18$!",2
"My wife and I went to Disneyland today. I've been many times and never given a review below 4. In fact, it may be my last. There are things I've come to expect. Growing world population longer waits more patience. Disney has now got to the point where the parking time alone and transportation into the park is an hour, ironically the same time the wait for a ride which really has always been the case. The problem is this is the second time in a row now multiple major rides broke down. The monorail to the hotels and other activities broke down as well. I can deal with one sometimes two of these but you throw in the fact that a single park pass is now $100 per person for a day and snacks and one meal with a drink for the day are another $60. They continue to successfully raise prices because they have the best marketing team in the world and all I can see is crowd sizes growing each time I come meaning we are still willing to pay that amount for  the Happiest Place in the World . We were frustrated so we went to Disney city hall to see if we could get swapped to California. Nope. Just an offer for one fast pass to a single attraction in Disney. Thanks but we said no and left. I'm no fuddy and this has been one of my favorite places in the world forever but it has finally reached a point that major changes need to come before I will return.",2
"What made me mad was we normally leave during the afternoon crowds and come back around 6pm but coulddon't. There was a special event (Halloween party) thus we coulddon't do that. Also, it was so crowded that we only spent a single day in the park and found other (free) stuff to do around LA instead, like going to the beach. As Disneyland closed early, there were no fastpasses available during the afternoon so we ended standing in huge lines. What a waste of time and we'll not be coming back anytime soon. Disneyland is packing in huge crowds so I'm sure they could care less.",2
"The park was so packed we coulddon't walk. The sidewalks were full to the point of being dangerous. Matterhorn Bobsleds shut down and then they closed the Haunted Mansion because preparations for the evening light show Fantasmic! around the lagoon required roping off entire areas all evening. It was absolutely ridiculous! If they dodon't have an area to do the show like they do in Florida, then they shoulddon't do itDiddon't even go to Disneyland the second day   wasted Park Hopper $$ and stayed at California Adventure!",2
"Cadon't help the weather, but what is up with closing the park for some crazy Mickey Halloween Party on M, W, F during October.Busy time of year because of all the fall breaks.Dodon't recommend every going at this time again.But when is it a good time to go really?",2
"I think this will be our last trip to Disneyland. The prices have become outrageous to just stand in line for 1   2 hours to ride an attraction and be jostled about by so many people. There are not enough benches for seating for older members of our family who need to sit down and rest at times. It was very hot and humid when we were there and it was just too hot standing in the sun in long, crowded lines.We tried to watch the fireworks one night and people crowded themselves in very early to the front of the park. Everywhere we tried to stand we were told we had to move yet they have sections blocked off with empty benches for 'company' employees. We watched the clean up people walk along and make an attempt to sweep a piece of paper into their receptacle but if they missed it, they just walked on. It isdon't the same clean and enjoyable experience we used to enjoy in years past. I think Walt Disney would be very disappointed by how it has changed. Food is terribly expensive and on hot days, drinks are exorbitant!! $4.49 for a small bottle of lemonade!!!!",2
"Sadly, I'm afraid I'll have to agree with previous poor reviews. Disneyland has taken a turn for the worse of late. Overbooked, understaffed, overpriced, under maintained. This is the first time I have run into so many curt, smile less  cast members . But I can understand based on the mass numbers of totally self absorbed, entitled park visitors they must deal with every day.And based on the numbers, and what appeared to be a very short staffed park, cleanliness suffered. Used to be every restroom, cafe, ride and venue was spotless and shiny. Not this trip. So many men's rooms with wet floors...and not from being cleaned... So may eateries with dirty tables, usually hogged by families that weredon't even eating, just looking for some place out of the heat to sit, while those people that actually bought food had to stand or find someplace else to eat.Many areas were just not very well kept or clean, though it appeared they were trying. But with so many people jammed into the park, it's obviously impossible to keep up.And the jazzy's and scooters were everywhere. Not to mention the gazillion strollers, many of which diddon't have kids in them...but were filled with coolers, backpacks and bags...no children in sight. Maybe, just maybe, if they were to drop the price of the food people woulddon't insist on bringing in so much extra stuff and they'd probably sell more than enough to make up for the lower prices. And while I'm on a roll, what's with the single rider lines? Whole families would get in line in the very much shorter single rider lines just to avoid waiting like the rest of the people willing to play by the rules. Plus car full after car full of wheel chair and scooter riders. Sorry, but if you are truly that bad off physically, should you be riding Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad...? Luckily, we fell for the con and bought a multiple day pass, thus adding to the masses, and were eventually able to ride most of what we wanted to, in spite of more than one  popular  ride being shut down sometimes for hours each day.Not sure if we'll make the trip again. Sorry for my family, but at least the entitled ones will have a few less people to contend with.",2
"We are a diehard Disney family, visiting at least once a year, but this visit was miserable. The park was crowded, producing long waits on all the rides and the weather was unseasonably hot to add to the misery. Crowds and weather cannot be controlled by Disney but their cast members can and should be. I have never had a cast member be anything but pleasant to me and rudeness seems to be the new norm. I am not a fan of the crowd control techniques either. At both the parade and Fantasmic, standing is required to squeeze in more people. A group that had been sitting for almost two hours for the parade was required to stand before the parade start despite the fact that there was no clamor to join the viewing. It was infuriating because eight rows deep, everyone could see perfectly. After standing, only the first two rows could see. Tall people and children on shoulders made viewing from three rows back obstructed at best. After the parade, everyone was sent on a forced march around the trail behind Big Thunder. If Disney is going to force people to make this trek in the dark, they need to install adequate lighting. The Fastpass system for Fantasmic is a nightmare of jostling angry crowds who have no hope of getting a good view. Only those with deep enough pockets to shell out for a dining experience could get a reserved seat with decent viewing. Shade structures or more shade trees and fans are desperately needed on some rides for guests standing in long lines on hot days. New, cool things included the castle decked out for the 60th anniversary and the new light parade. The new Frozen area on the Storybook boat ride is well done as well. None of this made up for being treated poorly by employees at every turn.Oh and be careful about traveling in September and October. Park hours were curtailed on three of our five days for the Halloween party. The number of hours we could be In the park was substantially reduced, although, of course there was no price reduction at gate.",2
"We were here, on a Tuesday in October, we did four rides in seven hours. The queues were horrendous but my disappointment really was in the attitude of staff who I had been lead to believe were customer focussed. No way.We went to city hall for our first time visitor badges as recommended by a fellow traveller. This would enable staff to ensure we were looked after. Now this would have been the time for the staff to tell us about fast lanes but they diddon't and it wasdon't until we asked why people were passing us in the lines using a different lane that another traveller explained. Check them out if you are going as they could save you hours of waiting. There is nothing slick about this place. We queued for tickets even and the process was very slow. We queued for lunch which was absolutely awful and I will review the French Market later if I can. We queued for toilets. One woman was sitting on the floor breastfeeding. I suspect there may have been somewhere else more comfortable for her but she obviously diddon't know and no one bothered to tell her. There is loads more I can say but you have the picture. When we eventually got a fast pass to the haunted house the woman monitoring the line told us to get a move on. Customer care indeed particularly as around the bend was yet another queue. Dodon't bother with the ride either. It was boring. The only good part was you can sit down. The best ride was the tram back to the car park. Does anyone think customer caring Disney will reply?",2
"The only reason I came back to this park was because I had my dad with me and he had not been back since he was a kid. I had purchased two $130.00 3 day park hopper passes for myself and my dad (military salute passes) and we had wanted to visit both parks. After only spending half the day at the original park, we left frustrated. We took the tram from the parking lot and two employees (the driver and the guy at the back of the tram got into a massive argument while we were there waiting to be loaded onto the tram. Then we get to the actual park gate. I saw an attendant and asked her which gate was for the disabled she snapped back at me  they all are!  (it was the same crochety wench that told me last year that I could not use the disabled entrance. I am a disabled veteran.) We enjoyed visiting with the big 5 at the main gate and then rode a total of 4 rides. There were a few that allowed us to enter the handicapped entrance and it was appreciated. Then we went to Pirates. We were told that there were too many people that pretend they are handicapped and now Disney just gives fast passes (which means you still stand around 30 minutes after your designated time and are mixed in with able bodied people who have fast passes). The service and quality have gone down hill and dad was sorely disappointed in the park because it was so much better when he was a kid. It was not as crowded, and the people were friendlier. We wodon't even waste our time here next year. 90 minute wait times per ride is the norm. As the day progresses the crowds just get worse and worse. The poor crowd management creates a dangerous situation and prevents park goers from enjoying their experience because most of the day is spent in long lines. That was not what Mr.Disney envisioned and if he saw the conditions now he would be heart broken. We had a much better time at Universal and will become season pass holders at their park instead.",2
"Sometimes folks ask whether they should go to Anaheim or Orlando to visit Disney, if they only can go to one. Well, this is really a no brainer. Should I stay at Motel 6, fly USAir in coach, and eat at McDonalds or should I stay at the Waldorf Astoria, fly Singapore Airlines in First, and eat at Victoria and Alberts? Whereas option 1 above would be far cheaper than option 2, the expense one has at DLR would be fairly comparable to WDW.As a Disney fan who has been on 16 DCL cruises, who has had Annual Passes for WDW for many years even while living in California, this weekend in Anaheim was hellish. (OK, I'm hyperbolizing and being a snob, I know.) So Saturday we walk to the park through the Maingate. We're trying to find the  no bag  entrance. Oh, there is none. So we stand in the hot sun (it got up to 104F 40C) and wait on one of the long lines. Once we are through, we wait in a shorter line to enter DCA. Our Premier Pass works. We go to get a Fast Pass for the Racers in Carland. No, you cadon't do it online. You gotta go to one of those old fashioned kiosks, stick in your card, and hope you put it in right. Then it spits out the pass. At 10am we got 6 pm. As there was no place to escape the heat in the park, we exited to the Grand Californian Hotel. The bar was cool and pleasant. After a hard cider for me and a JW for Jack, we were happier. This was followed by a stop at Uva. It's always pleasant but still hot since it's outside. We had a 1:50pm reservation at the Carthay Circle Restaurant. So we thought we 'd hang out at the lounge till our table was ready. We had to stand in a line for 30 minutes in the sun to get a place in the lounge! Finally we got in and had a lovely experience there. After a while we were taken upstairs to a lovely venue. The service was great, the food mediocre at best. You pay for the ambiance. After a late lunch , we just went back to our hotel. The crowd and heat just made it unbearable. Come Sunday morning, Jack wanted to go to ihop. We usually dodon't frequent chain diners, but I agreed. Once there, he decided to skip it and head straight to the park. It's 8:20am. We stand in line to go through security. It is a Zoo. Times Square! The Magic Kingdom like park doesdon't open till 10:00 am. Ok, we will head to Downtown Disney. But there are barriers. We wait in line several times for cross traffic. I decide to find a breakfast place. I was able to get a 8:50 at Steakhouse 55. We fight our way through the crowd. We make it just in time. We sit in the lounge there after checking in. Of course, the lounge is unmanned. After 25 minutes, we were seated. We had a lovely brekkie with the Fairy Tale Cuv  e.Now it was back to either the park or the hotel. Either way, again back through security. We patiently waited. As the person in front of us gets their bags checked, we pass as we have no bags. We get yelled at for being rude. The lines to get into the park is again huge. We escape back to the hotel.What a different experience from Orlando. Even if it's crowded in a certain park, you can escape. We've been at very busy times. You can enter Epcot through the back. I've never seen a line to get into the Rose and Crown. You can pre book fast passes. Many places to cool off.I think we'll just make the transcontinental trip next time and spend our money in heaven, not in hell.",2
We went to the Mickey trick or treat on Oct 7th. It was a sold out event. The kids had to wait in line for over 10 minutes at each station just to get 2 pieces of candy. Many of the rides were shut down. The worst part was that there was limited food! They shut down all the normal vendors & shops when the place closes for the trick or treaters so the only food was popcorn from 6 midnight! It was crazy!! So not worth it!,2
"Visited this past weekend and have never left the happiest place on earth so disappointed. If you do not purchase a ticket for the holiday treat you should just not go. Granted it was very hot but when they shut down Disney, the other park gets way to crowded",2
"We just got back from a crazy three days at the resort. I think we are done. First of all, you only need two days to experience Disneyland and California Adventure The crowds this weekend were unlike anything I have ever experienced. On Sunday it was a 30 minute line just to get through the bag check so we could then wait in line 15 minutes to get into Disneyland. From there every attraction was a minimum of 60 minutes wait time. Fast Pass got us on Star Tours but we had to wait four hours to ride it. There were several of the main rides that if you diddon't have your Fast Pass by noon, you were out of luck. It also diddon't seam to be as clean either. Maybe they were overwhelmed by the crowds but we saw a lot of empty water bottles laying around. I remember there being a lot of cleaning folks walking up and down main street. Not this time. There was pop corn all over, wrappers, etc. I will never understand why people cadon't walk the 20 steps to throw stuff in the garbage cans that are everywhere.I guess for someone who is experiencing their first visit, everything is great. But this was probably my 8th visit and for as much as you now have to pay, I was hoping to experience the Disney Magic I had experienced before. And I am sure that compared to other Southern California theme parks it's the nicest, but I just dodon't think it is what it used to be. When my kids are asking to leave early, I know I am not alone.",2
We are disappointed that Disney is not customer oriented any longer. There were so many people in the park even for early entry that it was unbelievable. Guests with strollers are rude and if I had not moved quickly I would have been run over by a motorized vehicle. It was bad enough guests with strollers ran over my right foot and ankle while I was standing in line. The guests did not even say excuse me. Not sure if we will return since this was very disappointing with the crowds.,2
"We have been visiting Disneyland every year since our son was three years old. He is twenty now. We have always gone in the fall but the last few years have been continually disappointing to us. Finding October and November to be so crowded presumably because of the holiday decorations we decided to go in September. Our first day was pretty good as it was a Thursday but the rest of the weekend was terrible. Two hour wait lines and many rides broken down. We have to pay to fly down, pay for a hotel and then only get on a few rides or to wait in line to have it break down as we finally approached the entry. Its an expensive trip for us. Just not what it used to be. We still love it but are perplexed as to when to go as it seems the crowds are always beyond terrible these days. Even the Dole Whip line was over 30 minutes. Kind of a bummer for us. And why do they decorate early? They used to not have the Christmas decorations up until after Thanksgiving. Now its before.",2
Most of the workers I came in contact were sarcastic and unhelpful. I understand that it was a busy weekend but it costs a lot of money to get into the parks so maybe this staff needs to learn from the Florida cast on how to treat guests. There was a cast member name Justin who worked at the Avengers picture area and when the cast was going to switch characters he told us in line to be patient and that the world would keep spinning. Very snide not impressed. My four year old thought he was mad at the crowd. This is just one example of the rude experience we had.,2
"We live in Chicago, but my kids love Disney. We have been to Disney World multiple times and this is our second time at Disneyland. We looove the California Adventure Park. Disneyland Park is just ok. For starters it is REALLY old. We were visiting for two days and Space Mountain broke down while we were in line, the Haunted house broke down, the Matterhorn broke down, Splash Mountain broke down, Winnie the Pooh Broke down....and every single break down happened when we were already in line!!! Secondly, the set up of Disneyland was poorly executed....a perfect example would be that you have to walk all the way into Critter Land at the back of Frontierland to get to Splash Mountain, and there is only one way in and one way out!!! This creates traffic jams and dangerous situations when the park is crowded and hot. Speaking of hot...why is there no place to cool down in Disneyland? There are no sprayers, no water squirters, no trees, no nice shady canopies, nothing! We actually walked into Toonland hoping to find the same spray area that they have in Disney World, to find that there is nothing. You feel like you are in the desert, oh wait, you are. Fourth, I have said it once and I will say it again. Raise the prices and let fewer people into the parks. When it is this crowded it is not enjoyable. We dodon't even go during the busy times. I cadon't imagine the hell that must be. Lastly, Disneyland needs to update their app and their fast pass system. In a day of electronics it seems a bit backward to me to be running from fast pass kiosk to fast pass kiosk, when you should be able to just click a link on your phone. ",2
"We are a large family, two little children ages 3 and 5, and two older children 12 and 14.Too make it simple I have been to Disneyland many times and decided to finally take my children. There is nothing there for my 3 year old, she was scared of all the rides except small world and we spent most of our time in the bippity boppity boo princess store. My five year old was also scared of a lot of the rides , Pinocchio did not go well at all.My older children were so disappointed because 60 percent of the day was spent waiting in lines. (we were there for two days staying at the Disneyland Resort).It was so overcrowded that at one point I felt a panic attack coming on from all the people .Had to take a break, split up the family and went to the hotel to relax (Disneyland Resort was great). I still remember twenty years ago when Disneyland was affordable now its so expensive we could barely afford it (actually grandparents paid as a present) we just paid food and drinks, by the way four hots dogs and drinks 45 dollars.The one thing I really looked forward to was the Fantastic show, got the fast pass for it at 9 in the morning blah blah finally at night we waited in line to sit down in our section, it was like a stamped , within seconds there was nowhere to sit and me and all my kids had no where to go but leave the area. So we coulddon't watch the show at all, the other people were nasty and holding two little children in my arms got no help from the employees there so I could at least exit. Terribly organised. Yes I complained to them but they diddon't even answer me back.My two teenagers were so exhausted of standing in lines they vow to never go back. And with a sad heart either will I. Disneyland use to be a magical place for me as a child, used to be.Cant complain about the Disneyland Resort that was fabulous.",2
"I visited the Disneyland park one day because I had a quick weekend in Anaheim and had nothing to do. First of all I purchased a one day park hopper ticket from my hotel for $155. I find it extremely expensive to go to both Disneyland and California Adventure. I can go to other theme parks in the Los Angeles area for about $60 a day. I walked into the park and it was packed. I wasdon't really surprised because it was a weekend and it was Disneyland. I wanted to get in line for Star Tours. It was an hour wait so I decided to get a fast pass. I tried getting on Space Mountain which was another hour wait. So I tried to get a fast pass and it woulddon't let me get one because I had the one for Star Tours. I remembered when I went in 2012 I could get an unlimited number of fast passes but now I cadon't. I finally got on the Haunted mansion after an HOUR in the park. I woulddon't have a problem in waiting in these lines if they would put more shade up. It happened to be one of the hottest days in Anaheim and I got hot quick. After that I got in this huge line for the Star Tours Fast Passes. Now I thought we were allowed to go in immediately once our time was called, that did not happen. They let small groups of 4 people go in at a time. Of course the line is in the heat and I started to get furious. I decided to get lunch and bought Gumbo and a drink for $15. I went to California Adventure afterward to go ride some rides. I go in line for Screaming over California. Since I was by myself I could ride single rider. I walk to the guy and he told me I had to wait in the regular line. I wanted to cuss him out. I never had this problem before. So I decided to go back to my hotel and wait until later to come back when everyone else has left. It isdon't the same anymore. They just want to over charge on anything. I do not have plans on returning to the park.",2
"We love Disney, first time to Disneyland, it was very small, staff unfriendly, not specatuclar like Disney World. The parades and fireworks were the highlights.",2
"Our family drove down from canada with our RV, fortunately this wasdon't the main focus of our trip. Some of the pros, Disney band was good, the parade was good, the park has a lot of attention to detail. Some of the cons, over priced food, insane lineups, we averaged 3 rides a day. Reliability of the rides was substandard. Splash mountain had a break down when we were in line with fast pass, a raft ride in California adventure broke down when in line with fast pass. Pirates of the Caribean closed. The fast pass apparently has quotas and could not be used for the cars ride in California adventure. The ART transportation sign outside of Disney is out dated. We got on the wrong bus. Route 2 has changed and sign is not updated. Another problem was we had a 3 day ART pass. These are only 3 consecutive uses, so be mindful if you take a day off Disney park. Long story short the kids moderately enjoyed disneyland but if I never see the park again I cadon't say I would miss it. I will however check out there public stocks because that place is a cash cow with the markups.",2
"Loved Disneyland until yesterday. Tried to go into parking structure but were diverted to the  Toy Story  lot where we waited for a bus to bring us to the park. We paid the regular $17.00 to park miles away and arrived an HOUR later. It is clear Disney does not care about guests. When we went to City Hall to ask about this we were told there is nothing they can do about it. It wasdon't the case of the lot being full because as we left and hoards of people were still streaming in, the parking structure was open. Will not renew pass.",2
"The park was way too crowded.  Also, the rides were basically the exact same rides that they had when I was a child more the 35  years ago!  Very disappointed.",2
"Boring! Honestly... The thick crowds and the lack of thrilling rides was a huge disappointment for myself, my hubby and my 11 year old. I was expecting thrill rides but diddon't get them until we went to the adventure park next door. Having said that   the decor for the rides was brilliant & spectacular. The whole place is a spectacle... But if you are not into bling i woulddon't do more than one day here. ",2
"The queues were very long, many of the popular rides were closed for refurbishment. It would have been helpful if public announcements were made about closures and break downs. The rides are getting a bit old and creaky. The day we visited it was about 37 degrees so staff were not as friendly as usual.",2
"Bought our tickets online and never even received a confirmation email. Was told when I called the 1800 number, that we would just need to provide the comf. Number at the ticket counter. So we did that our 1st day and on our way into Disneyland we were told the park would be closing at 5pm instead of 10. Well that would have been good to know before we entered the park. Did not get park hopper passes because we are adults with no kids and were planning on going to one park per day. So we missed all of the lights and Halloween decorations for the main park. Not worth the amount that we paid. ",2
"After a lifetime of waiting, our dream of visiting Disneyland came true, only to be told at 5 pm that the park needs to be vacated immediately for a private party. No parades, no fireworks, we saw just 50 % of the park. Suddenly the smiling people at the happiest place on earth had turned stony faced and indifferent, just wanting us to leave, and of course there were no refunds. Shame on you Disney, Shame on you USA. At least be fair and dodon't loot people. Is it too much to expect from a 'civilised' country?",2
"Enjoyed the park during the day on 4th of July, despite two broken rides. We received fast passes as compensation. However, as soon as it was time for the nighttime shows and fireworks, the park turned into total chaos. We were ushered around the park in circles for over an hour and were not allowed to stand anywhere, especially not on Main Street to watch the fireworks. Countless parents with strollers (granted, they shoulddon't really be there so late at night in my opinion) were screaming and trying to get out because it felt so unsafe. I injured my ankle because were were squashed between the sidewalk traffic and the main road, and I tripped over the separation rope. Shame on you Disneyland! Dodon't sell more tickets than people you can manage at your park!!!",2
"The park has gone WAY downhill lately, especially in regard to crowd control. I visited on Labor Day, which I knew would be busy. I've been to Magic Kingdom (in FL) on Christmas Day when they've had to cap attendance, so I'm fine with dealing with crowds bigger than this. However, the way Disney performed you'd think they'd never seen big crowds before. They mismanaged the traffic parking so badly it took an hour and a half to park (at 7:30am!) once we were within .3 miles of the park. Cast members kept telling us we shoulddon't have come on Labor Day, which is something a customer should never be told. Multiple rides were down (with no signs out front at first!), including most of Tomorrowland. The monorail coulddon't run in the heat, but they had no backup plan so guests were forced to walk to Downtown Disney hotels in the high heat large crowds   major heat stress health risks. Our security person was a rude, clueless woman which was frightening on such a crowded day, at a place like Disney.To make matters worse, Disneyland's own actions led to the chaos. Rude cast members kept saying Labor Day is one of the worst days of the year. If that's the case, why did Disney hold a marathon that weekend, bringing in more guests? Why did they allow the day to be open for annual passholders? They did nothing to cap attendance, then coulddon't handle it and even complained about it to paying guests. Ridiculous for how much money you pay. Disney should be used to this by now, and have some standards.",2
"Really disappointed to have to give such a low rating, but the severe overcrowding that takes place completly spoils the visit. Everybody expects long queues at Disney, but the huge crowds even make it difficult to walk around the park and it felt unsafe at times. Have waited for this trip for so long, but left feeling very deflated.",2
"I woulddon't recommend visiting Disneyland during summer. This was my 4th visit to Disney & probably my last.We arrived when the park opened & had a great first 2 hours, but by 12 the park was so crowded we could barely move. The average wait time for a ride was 1.5 hours.The park continued to get more & more crowded as the day went on.We wanted to give our kids the full Disney experience so we battled the crowds until 8.30 & decided to then try to leave. However, leaving the park & this time was almost impossible, as the light parade & fireworks were about to begin. As we tried walking out of the park we were yelled at by almost every Disney employee we passed because according to them you cadon't go anywhere near the parade unless you have sat and reserved a spot(which means sitting for 5 hours). Everything stops in the park at this time so you have no choice but to leave however this is impossible. We all left the park feeling horrible ( not the happiest place on earth after all).",2
"Hot, overcrowded with little chance of getting on rides .... I certainly wasdon't feeling the Disney Magic! Disneyland could learn a lesson from Universal and provide better shaded facilities for queuing and use cooling fans.",2
"Oh Disneyland I love you so. It makes me sad to give you a bad review. The entertainment is amazing and the attractions spectacular but it is so dang crowded. I know going in summer the lines are expected to out of control but with a bit of planning its doable. Its sad the fastpass window is so strict these days (I get it but I think there is opportunity to look at some things) especially when its crowded fastpasses for the ultimate attractions are gone, you have one so you cant get another (yet), and the wait is so long for another you WILL MISS your FP time. Even long lines I can deal with but getting from one point to another is nearly impossible. Too many people are stressed out and so rude and TRASHY. I saw more T and A at Disneyland than I did in Vegas last week. People need to put some clothes on and have their undergarments covered. It used to be the happiest place on earth but its quickly becoming the trashiest place on earth. Dont take your kids unless you want to explain what side boob, thongs, twerking, and dry humping are (I saw all that and more).",2
"I am a disabled veteran and rented an electric vehicle to get around the park with my family. People do not pay attention to what is going on, nor does it seem like they even care about the disabled people coming along and trying to get through. they just walk right in front of you and cut you off, nudge you out of there way and keep walking. It seems the foreigners, mainly the Chinese are the worst. They walk around like they are the owners and you don,t matter.OOOPS, maybe they do own the park.. The work staff is very polite and nice, good job, but the park just keeps selling entry tickets and selling entry tickets and eventually, one can not get around nor go on any rides. wait time was over an hour and a half at some times. The foreigners on a whole make it a very miserable time at the park and as far as I am concerned, the park is nothing, nothing like it was years ago. Back then you actually had fun at the park. Disneyland has become a place for foreigners and not for americans. You would be better off and have molre fun at a  SIX FLAGS   MARINE WORLD  OR  GREAT AMERICA  amusement park than at Disney land and the other parks are not as expensive either. Sorry, but we were very disappointed for the amount of money spent for this vacation. Had to save a long time for this and was actually glad to leave for home.....Sorry.",2
"Went with medium expectations. Found the resort overpriced, busy, with very poor fast tracks. Spent all day there and only managed four rides. We left before the 8.30 parade because we did not want to wait for 90 minutes to queue for another ride, Was bored waiting around. Food good, attractions dated. Left feeling disappointed. Will not be repeated.",2
"No matter what day you go the park it will always be crowded. Always crowded with annual pass holders or locals. Handicap rules are unrealistic for people with true disabilities. Ticket prices are so expensive and when you arrive lines are tooo long or rides are closed. They do not have a handle on crowd control. They allow to many people in the park that you cadon't enjoy the park. Better cheaper parks in neighboring area, but because its Disney you want to enjoy the new shows but you cadon't way out of control with the crowds and honestly dangerous. ",2
"If your looking to go to Disneyland and want discount tickets stop looking. I've tried looking HIGH and LOW there are none. The biggest discount you can find is $10 and everyone has that discount. The biggest discount offered was thru Anahe1m.com. They say they have a $41.00 ticket. But, you cadon't get that ticket and they do not answer their phones. It will ring 4 to 5 times and then disconnect you.When I called Disneyland to ask about the California Resident ticket they said it expired in May and that there were no other discounts for California residents in any form. Considering the average bottle of water is $5 and you cadon't get a meal for under $20 they should keep the California discount.",2
"I think 60 years ago the park may have been the right size for the crowds but not for 2015. Family's spent lots of money to make this a memorable trip, but sad when the memory is lots of people, long lines, and short ride experience. Was able to get in 4 rides in the course of a day. That's about $ 25 a ride. Disney really needs to start considering comfort and safety of the guests, or like the airlines, are they just watching the bottom line",2
It's always great to be able to take a trip to Disneyland but I may say that the customer service is horrible. Out of three days that we where there only a hand full of time we were told to have a magical day or thank you for that matter. We wodon't be planning another trip to Disney park any time soon after the bad experience with costumer service. ,2
"I've brought my family to Disneyland and Disney world many times over the years. This time we stayed at the disneyland Californian grand adventure hotel which I do recommend. Staying on property gives you the amenity of early admission which is awesome! Also this particular hotel has an entrance for California adventure which comes in handy. However, the park itself was disappointing. It seriously appeared to be oversold as I cadon't imagine it was within the safe capacity. The main thoroughways were shoulder to shoulder continuously after about noon each day we were there. The entire crowd moved at an extremely slow pace, frustrating everyone. To make matters worse they began blocking off the main thoroughways at about 7pm for the parades, light shows, and fireworks. This made movement of the crowds near impossible. Forget trying to get to any of the destinations you were planning to get to. At the same time they close down 2 full sections of the park, toontown and fantasyland. This shoves even more people into less space. And to brighten your evening the cast members are there to continuously tell you to  keep moving  when the the entire crowd in front of you is standing still and there is literally no possible way anyone can move. Another odd change is that, there are long line areas where they used to have the lines but now they keep the guests waiting outside in the heat and let a few in at a time to make the long walk in the air conditioning where people standing outside could be (and used to be). I understand that a day at Disney with crying children causes high stress, but there's been a change since my last visit to Disneyland as the tension seems to start with the tone of the cast members. ",2
"We have been traveling to Disney World a lot over the last 2 years, as my kids totally love it. We just came back from our Orlando vacation and because of a business trip to LA we had a day to visit Disneyland. We laughed at how small Sleeping Beauty's castle is compared to Cinderella's   really no comparison. Also, everything in Disneyland is shot   the umbrellas have big discoloration, you find trash left in corners, park personnel is not as useful and polite as in WDW. It honestly felt like an ordinary theme park. Now, Indiana Jones's ride is great (and not existent in WDW) but that is about it. The other park (Adventure) is nicer and newer, but again it lacks the magic.TIP: we parked at the Grand Californian ballet and walked to the parks (not from the inside the hotel)   it is a very short, easy and fun walk. And at the end of the day we got back from the internal gate to the hotel, and paid $46 for the full day, totally worth it in our opinion!",2
"Disneyland was very disappointing, huge crowds, very long wait. We will never go back, it did not worth almost $100 entry fee.MovieWorld, DreamWorld, SeaWorld and other attractions at Gold Cost are better value, better rides and not as many people :) We went to Disneyland on Monday , hopping that crowds will not be too big. Disappointed.",2
"We spent 3 weeks traveling the US on our honeymoon from the UK. Disneyland was a must as I proposed at Walt Disney World in Orlando last year. Firstly, the selfie stick ban was only explained to us when on the tram and at security bag check. I discussed my frustration with security, as I feel telling people once they've been dragged across the parking lots about it isdon't very fair. We had no problem about it being banned, just that then expecting us to spend more time going back on the tram, all through the parking lots to return it, then queue AGAIN was unreasonable.She said we take it back or put it in a locker (I think she said it was $15). whatever the price was, we bought the stick for less so it wasdon't worth it. I eventually said just the keep the thing as my wife was getting quite distressed. After then queuing to enter, we went to the guest services. We discussed what had happened and how unhappy we were, to which we were given a flyer about the ban (I said this is useless now, it should've been given to us at the gate) and told  it's all in the news about places banning them . I explained I'm not from the USA, selfie stick bans aredon't all over the news in the UK. He said that security should have offered to leave it at lost and found and get it back later. After explaining she never offered this and now we've lost our selfie stick for no reason, he was able to retrieve it and send it to lost and found. By this point we'd wasted over an hour of our ONE DAY at the park.I bought up the amount of q jumping and saving space for friends at one of the rides to the staff, who said  I never saw it so I cadon't help . Everyone else could see it, the party in front of us grew from 2 to 11, and the party in front of them almost doubled, just before getting on the ride. I just dodon't find it fair and it was happening everywhere.Later on, the light parade was not far from starting, so we went to find a decent stop to watch. The cast members just usher you around the park. I asked on 3 occasions where to watch from, each person sent me to the next, they;d say i cadon't stand there then move me on! The 4th member said  people have been waiting for hours, maybe you should have done that . Diddon't appreciate his rudeness at all. We were literally herded from near New Orleans square all the way to Main Street USA, which was almost a full circle around the park.",2
"We have visited Disney World in Florida many times. We knew this park was smaller but excited to visit a new park. We were disappointed for their 60 anniversary. Yea it rained but did not except it to shut down all the rides, cancel the parade and fireworks. The Florida park handles rain just fine but this park does not. You would have thought a tornado landed in the middle of Torrowland. The park is significantly smaller than Disney World but knowing that Walt walked the streets were pretty cool. I excepted high prices but they were similar to those at Disney World. Glad I say that we went but wodon't be wanting to plan another trip.",2
"Wow. I thought line jumping was not allowed.... It was rampant here. I hate to give a low review, I love Disney stuff. The only good parts of the whole day were Space Mountain and Mr. toad's Wild Ride. Awful food at crazy prices. Stick with Disneyworld.  ",2
"It's for my kids love of Disney that brings me to this theme place otherwise I would not come even if it's free admission. While few staff are helpful and courteous many staff are rude. All those time we come here it's always a bad experience mainly because it's so crowded, long line everywhere, parking, rides, restaurant, bathrooms etc and even malfunction of some rides after waiting an hour. The fast pass is not even worth anything. ",2
"Oh where to start, I will admit I am not a theme park enthusiast, but I am a team player and the husband and small boys love them, so I play along. But to say I loathe this place after our latest visit would be an understatement.This is our fourth visit in three years....I have never been a fan but my distaste is strong.Our biggest change and disappointment was the discontinuation of the former DAS program while there are still minor accommodations for those wanting to enjoy the park with disabilities it is a far reach one size fits all pass, that only applies to rides with current fast pass availability. Many of those rides are not the ones young children would seek out. We end up riding Astro Blasters all day because it's the most accommodating. This program could be better suited as a tiered program where the adjustments are made based on need. Physical disabilities require different accommodations than mental disabilities.The overall line durations were in the 45 90 minute range this is unacceptable in my opinion when paying over $100 per ticket per person per day. If at the park for 10 hours and you stop to eat overpriced, close to expired food twice in that day you might luck out and hit 7 rides that last less than 2 minutes each.The food is lousy, (excluding the fried chicken) they have no refillable drink cups despite the fact other theme parks in California do (they cite health regulations when I asked), so your spending $3 $4 minimum per drink. Food line ups are long and you can bank on $60 to feed a family of 4.Then there is my biggest peeve of all, rude staff and that damned parade! I take huge issue with Disney encouraging people to line up 2.5 hours Before the Parade. They rope off huge areas and drive the masses through 6' pathways that include wheelchairs, strollers, excited kids and grumpy grown ups. I think this dangerous, annoying and catering to the minority. Trying to move around once these ropes (barricades) are in place is like threading needles. It's painful!I'm not a fan, it's not the happiest place on earth and to say I despise their business model would be an understatement.Hope to say I'm never coming back!",2
Parking was quick and easy...had to wait for the tran..park very crowed at some point you coulddon't even walk due to people jams. ..likescand fast pass very long...hot hot and sweaty. .food in park restaurants are terriblem.sit donw restaurants over booked and could not get in. Lines for line toooo long...also grad night so park wass fliied with teens..no place to see stand for parade and after that no fireworks!! Which we waited for after spending 300 dollars for one day one park.not to mention food and drinks we were totally let down....this day was surely not the happiest place one earth. .it will be a long long time if i ever visit it again..next time go to knotts berry farm... why people get season passes is beyond me..who would want to torture themselves to this weekly and small kids..which were mostly hot miserable and crying any way,2
"I have been to the Magic Kingdom at least a dozen times. This was the most disappointing. $610 to get in the door for a family of four. The Matterhorn, Space Mountain and haunted house were all broken down as we arrived at the entrances. Now we are told we need a fast pass to watch Fantasmic. This morning was fun, this afternoon has been a waste of time. ",2
"I have been to Disneyland in Anaheim many times and have always enjoyed the experience.I am not sure what happened when I visited it last week. We firstly visited the haunted house, and waited over an hour in line, then 20 minutes in the elevator which takes us down to the cars. I thought , well it is summer and this is to be expected.We then found that ride was not the only broken one. The Tower of terror was nearly a 2 hour wait, as 2 of the elevators of 4 were broken, space mountain had a longer wait than normal another hour and a half, and I saw the theme reoccurring. I felt sorry for the parents and children on Roger rabbit ride, it too has some issues with equipment and times were longer than usual. The children behind me in line had waited over an hour and were bored and restless, as were other children around me and I am sure their experience was not a positive one. I heard their parents complaining and not wanting to return. I am not sure if they were having problems in the hot weather or crowds were larger than normal.Sadly it means that the longer you wait the less rides you are able to particpate on. Of course there are the express passes, but you can only use them within a set timeframe.By the the end of the day we were fairly tired, and it was a hot day, we had decided to visit the California Adventure Park section and go and eat at the Alfresco Tasting terrace. Surprisingly the reception area girl told us the place was full, or in their words, their commitment compliment had reached optimum quota numbers. We were told we could go and try the fast food places opposite. Firstly if we had wanted that style of food we would not be trying their establishment and secondly its a strange thing to be pushing other places which do not attempt to serve the same style food. She did not seem to see the problem. Finally after explaining our options she offered their restaurant terrace??? Which apparently had not reached the commitment quota compliment, as had the downstairs section. Why was this the last option?? We happily accepted this as we could choose a glass of wine and have some local cheeses etc. We were perplexed as to why this option was LAST.Inexperience on her part??? She had another person working with her who did not say anything to us about it either. Maybe they were both inexperienced in hospitality.As much as I enjoy Disneyland, this experience was not the best one I have had.",2
"I am an avid Disney fan. I live in Texas but have been an annual passholder off and on for the past 17 years. It gets more expensive and more crowded every year. This visit, I had a bad experience that has left a bad taste in my mouth and I am disappointed with the way Disney is handled a problem that I had. As most families do when they arrive at Disneyland, they stop to take a photo in front of the flowers at the entrance. We pre paid for our Disney Photo Pass so we wanted to take advantage of it. We stopped for several minutes to do some photos and there were 2 photographers there so we were able to take some pictures with our camera as well as his. When we walked off, my daughter left her sunglasses on the brick wall and realized it a couple of minutes later as we walked in front of City Hall. She ran back to the Photo Pass Photographers who had just took our pictures and asked if they had seen her prescription sunglasses and the Photo Pass Photographer told us that the photographer who took our pictures had the glasses and was taking them to lost and found!!! In the mean time, I had gone straight to Lost and Found to file a report. As with all things Disney, I had to stand in line for 45 minutes. Once I gave the report, the girl said that the photographer had not turned them in yet but for us to check back that evening or the next day. I called every day and that photographer never turned them in or the system at the Lost and Found is bad. These are $400, Kate Spade prescription sunglasses!! Sadly, sunglasses aredon't covered on insurance and she had these glasses for one week. I dodon't know what to do. Lost and Found is no help. They said that they get hundreds of glasses per day and throw them away after 2 weeks. I have called almost every day for 2 weeks and they say that they dodon't have them. What happened to them???This visit was overall disappointing at Disneyland. We were disappointed with the crowds and the Grad Night craziness all day throughout the park. We were there 9 days and never got to see the fireworks. Three of the days were canceled due to high winds. The other days were so crowded that they felt dangerous. Once the parade is over the entire park crams into Main Street to watch the projections and the fireworks. This must be some sort of safety hazard. If there was a fire or something else happened, that people had to make a fast exit, there would be people who are trampled. Not to mention, people have to get a spot at least 4 hours before to get a place and then when the parade is over...all hell breaks loose and every man is for themselves. Not happy with this! ",2
"The only positive I have to say about Disneyland California is that the night show and fireworks show are absolutely amazing. Staff are rude and unorganised. Found our place for the night show and sat for 3 hours behind the rope, 15 minutes before show starts a rude female staff member tells us that this is a area for wheelchairs only, would have been nice to be told hours before the start of the show as there was other staff walking around who had not even approached up prior to this point. Perhaps organise the wheelchair area prior to 15 minutes before show time and perhaps dodon't demand people to move but explain in a nice manner. Maybe staff need to do some training in customer relations. Very disappointed considering this was the diamond anniversary and our family was so excited travelling half way across the world to be here only to have our experience ruined by rude staff. Meant to be the happiest place on earth, not in my opinion and we certainly will not be back.",2
"Went to Disneyland yesterday and it totally missed my expectations. There were broken rides everywhere! Indiana Jones, Barges to the Island, Pirates of the Carabean, Peter Pan.... Some would be down for an hour some would be down more. Went over to the California Adventure Park and the Elevator Ride only had one of three elevators working. And the Crowds!!! If you are going to have broken rides then reduce the number of people entering the park. There were a lot of Disney Characters but those lines were long...always. The park is getting old and tired. They should either get their mechanical act together or reduce the number of tickets available. I recommend Six Flags or another park. You get some of the same kind of thrill rides without the high entry cost. Sad",2
"I was pretty dissappointed with our last visit to DL Park. It's sad to see it getting old. The cast members dodon't have the same  sparkle  that they used to have. It was sad to see so many obese cast members as well. Some of their uniforms were literally bursting at the seams. I dodon't mean to be cruel, but I dodon't think many of them could have moved fast in an emergency situation. The major rides like Space Mountain were continually off line and the fast passes to get on weredon't much good if the ride was down.",2
"We are returning visitors to Disneyland, every time we go to California we visit the park. This was our 5th visit. It was, however, almost to the day 6 years since our previous visit to the park, and since then someone in the managment must have given priority to profits over maintenance of the rides. Prices was higher than ever, but I have never experienced so many breakdowns and problems with the rides. We experienced several cancellations due to technical problems, which is really annoying when you already have spent half and hour in the line. In the haunted house it was even worse, it broke down while we were inside the ride, with an unexpected half hour wait in the basement as a result. During our stay in California we have visited Disneyland, Universal Studios and Six Flags, two of the three gave value for money, Disneyland did not. Dodon't go there. We have been there for the last time.",2
"I guess I'm just not a Disneyland fan. In my opinion the park is grossly over priced, over crowded, and over rated.I could handle the price if it wasdon't so crowded. The wait time for the rides are unacceptable. Because of the long wait times there just isdon't enough time in the day to get on many rides making it a poor value. The food, drink, and souvenirs are grossly over priced. I only went because my wife had never been. We wodon't go again.",2
There were to long of queues for rides and that fast pass they have is a waste of time so stupid they should really do front of line tickets I would of paid extra for them found it very hard to work at where everything was no signs up saying which direction anything was diddon't find the staff friendly what so ever the only reason why gave them 2 was for the light show at half 8 then for the fire works at half 9 ,2
"My wife, I and 8 year daughter visited on a Wednesday in June from 8 AM   10 PM. It was Grad Night, so there were a lot of high school kids in the park. I'm sure there were more across the way at California Adventure since there are more thrill rides there. I strategically picked this day because it was a black out date for annual pass holders and the magic morning (one hour early arrival for Disneyland resort guests) was at California Adventure that day. Still, the crowds were ridiculous. Everyone sidewalk was packed, every line for each ride was long, and even the lines to eat very mediocre and over priced food were long. If you want a good view of one of the free parades or shows, you have to arrive an hour early and sit. We had fast passes to Fantasmic (wonderful show by the way), but the view was not that great and arriving earlier and getting one of the expensive dinner packages would have provided better views. After the 9 PM Fantasmic show, we tried to see the 9:30 PM fireworks, but they basically roped off the better viewing areas on Main Street (because it is packed and they let tons of people into the park in the evening just to view the fireworks), so there was nowhere for us to stand to watch the fireworks because they kept saying  you cadon't stand there  and we basically got ushered out of the park because there was nowhere else to go. On top of the that, there was a glitch in the fireworks show, and it stopped shortly after it began and never finished. And then the number of rides that were not available was annoying as well. In the morning, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, and the Haunted Mansion were all not available. Peter Pan's flight and Innoventions were both out the entire day and the Storybook Land Canal boats were out most of the afternoon. We were able to get Fastpass to ride Space Mountain and the Haunted Mansion. We obtained the Space Mountain Fastpass at noon and had to return at 4:25 pm to go on the ride. Splash Mountain only opened up later in the afternoon and by the time I came by, the wait was 120 minutes and there were out of Fastpasses. We did enjoy a handful of the rides, most notably the Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, It's a Small World, and the Disneyland Railroad. The park is very clean for the number of people that go through it and we still had some memorable moments. That being said, for $100 ticket, I dodon't feel I got my money's worth. I do recommend you arrive at the time they open because you can at least go on a few rides without long waits. The Matterhorn is probably a good ride to start with since they do not offer Fastpasses and the lines were very long. Here is a great site for planning: http:  www.disneytouristblog.com ",2
"Disney has great customer service, great attractions and shows. The drawback is the crowds are so large, even on a Tuesday, that you stand in lines the great majority of the day. The light show and fireworks show was great. However due to the huge lines, we were very limited to the number of rides we could take. Space Mountain and California Scream roller coaster were great. Dodon't waste your time on The Matterhorn, it is so jerky that it is actually painful. Nemos submarine ride is a dud. The Mr. Lincoln attraction is interesting, but parts of it are very dated. The tickets are very expensive and even with  fast pass' the waits are atrocious. You can get much more bang for your buck at other Southern California theme parks.",2
"There are too many people.  One day does not even come close to experiencing the park.  Lines were very long, and the parades, fireworks, etc. cause such a cluster that you cadon't navigate the park at all once they have begun early in the evening.",2
"We have annual passes with parking included. A week ago, we arrived around 10:00 and could not enter the main parking structure and had to proceed to Katella then left to Harbor to another lot. Checking with others the parking structure still had spaces available. Today, we arrived at 8:30 and again the main parking structure was closed. We were directed (with long lines of cars around the south end of the park behind California Adventure. We then had to compete with Disney buses to cross Harbor, then entered the Anaheim Garden Walk parking structure and had to either wait for shuttles or walk to the park. Again, the parking structure had lots of space available. This added at least a half hour to our entry time. Do not understand the process, however at least we could have had information to entered off the 5 freeway at Disney Way saving a traffic jam trying to go all the way around the park.",2
A two day pass with lunches for a family of four set us back over $800.00. Wait times for the more popular rides was about 45 minutes. Way too crowded and over priced to warrant a return trip.,2
"Crowds were horrible for the 60th anniversary...We attempted to go last Monday to Disneyland.. (one day park hopper) ...we waited 1 2 hour in line and only moved 5 feet in our attempt to enter the front gates of the park...after that we decided to leave and come back another day. apparently there was a longer check in period for those with multi park passes having to show IDs etc. However, there was no structure or organization to the process so everything was incredibly slow and backed up into both parks.FYI if you decide to leave: keep your parking ticket, you can get a refund within 3 hours of purchase,and you have one hour to return a scooter for full refund. D land tickets purchased online are good for about 1 year after purchase...",2
We were really excited to go to Disneyland this year. The prices (in case you did not know) have been raised again to almost 100.00 a ticket. Its crazy to think I paid much less for the park just a few years ago. The rides are pretty outdated and some of the best ones broke down while we were at the park (Indiana Jones and Space Mountain). Overall very disappointed.,2
"I was so looking forward to visiting Disneyland whilst I was in the US. I have been to the Disneyland in Paris, and absolutely loved it, so coulddon't wait to go to the original in Anaheim.Unfortunately, the crowds ruined the experience for me. Way, way too crowded and we went on a normal not holiday weekday! The line ups started before we even got through the main entrance. We arrived at 8.30am. First was the line up for the bag check (15 mins). Then a 25 minute line up for tickets (this could of course be avoided by purchasing tickets online). Then the line up to get in the front gates took 50 minutes!!!It just got worse from there. The lines for ALL rides were horrendously long and got longer as the day progressed. You could not comfortably walk through most of the park because of the amount of people there.Fast pass only allows you to get on a ride about every two hours or so. At best you get 4 rides in 8 hours. Although, if you lined up for the rides you'd go on even less as the lines are so long! All this for $99 per person! Seriously, never again!!!!",2
"I recommend adults get a one day pass with a hooper and for families to get a two day without the hopper. Adults can get around that little bit quicker and take advantage of single rider lines of you dodon't mind riding alone. Families can save some money and take their time in one of the parks at a time. Got there at 8am. Lines were short enough. They certainly got busier around 2. You can have a fast pass concurrently for each of the parks. Dodon't expect to find anything healthy to eat other than a banana in the park. Meal options for those looking for something other than a hotdog and lollipop should byo. Best tip: get a fast pass to Radiator Springs Racers as this one was out of fast passes around 2pm. Must see at Disneyland Adventure Park. 1. Disney's Aladdin2. Radiator Springs Racers3. California Screamin'Must see at Disneyland Park1. Nothing reallyWent on Indiana Jones Adventure, the Nemo Submarine and Space Mountain and all were ok. I left at 4pm so cadon't rate the night festivities. Checked it off the bucketlist. Wodon't be coming back unless I have kids. I'd certainly recommend for kids 10 12. ",2
"I havedon't been to Disney in years. I only went because I have a three year old and our family was going. The only day we could all attend was a high peak day ( 8 out of ten crowds) and a really hot day. After returning and have a few hours to mull it over I've come to this conclusion: unless you're a sadist, or have a child, I dodon't understand why you'd go there. A family member paid for our whole trip (Lucky us and we were beyond grateful happy!) so maybe I just feel guilty that he had to pay so much...? I dunno. I did at least 30 hours of solid internet research and looked at every Disney  secret tips  and hacks video out there but no matter how well prepared you are, it wodon't prepare you for the sheer crush of sweaty humanity. And the lines   ooooooooh, the lines!!!! Insert horror flashback here.Things that struck me as odd: They dodon't offer double strollers (like Legoland) so you'll have to rent a locker or pack lighter There's not enough shade seems like really poor planning.They aredon't equipped for the crowds   they ran out of  First trip  and  Birthday  buttons. Some of the workers seemed like they diddon't get the memo they were supposed to be happy nice  friendly. (I'm looking at you, grumpy ticket lady.)I was surprised by how dirty some of the bathrooms were  again it felt like they weredon't prepared for the crowds.The  iconic  pickle popcorn (CA  cars land) you can get only every 2 week or at least that's what I was told  why not have it all the time? My son loved It's a Small world, Pixar Parade (CA) and meeting the cars in cars land. It was a wonderful trip in that regard but the crowds & heat are the absolute worst. There are so few places that you can take refuge! I'd do the extra hour drive to Legoland almost any day of the week than deal with that circus again. They really need to get their act together in terms of crowd control especially for that hefty price tag. ;(",2
I dodon't think we will be returning anytime soon. We booked our trip far in advance before any mention of the 24 hour day. Disney was less than prepared for the event. We arrived at 8AM and by 10AM the place was a zoo. We also sadly learned that line cutting is permitted in Disneyland. One family member is permitted to wait on line while the rest of the family joins later. We saw this on many occasions and asked a cast member who said they try and accommodate everyone. We asked the cast member to explain that to our 4 year old who was disappointed when she was the cut off point for one of the Dumbo cycles. The cast member declined. Perhaps this is a west coast thing where line cutting is OK. We dodon't see this happen on the east coast in the amount we observed at Disneyland. We even cut our visit a day short because of the poor crowd handling and cast attitude. We wodon't be back anytime soon.,2
"Unfortunately we went on the busiest day in the last 20 years! Honestly, that's what was written up by Disney itself. It was May 22, 2015 and Disneyland was open 24 hrs that day. UNBELIEVABLE lines and crowds. People sitting on blankets and towels lined up for 5 hours ahead of time waiting for the parade made Main Street look like land of the homeless. Sad, sad, sad experience. Since we came to Anaheim for a graduation this was THE only day we could make it.",2
"I've been to Disney World literally hundreds of times. My second HS job was in the Magic Kingdom and numerous family members have worked there. So I'm more than familiar with the inner workings of Disney properties. This was our first trip to Walt's  original  park. Our kids go to a private school and finished a week before the public schools, so we thought we could beat the summer rush and enjoy a couple of relaxing days in the parks. Boy were we wrong. Every school in the Anaheim area was at Disneyland for end of year trips.The GOOD:  The weather was definitely better than Florida.   Lots of hotels close to Disneyland (two miles or less)  Tram ride was very short and parking was easy (because the park is so much smaller)The BAD:  There are probably half the rides for basically the same ticket price  Fireworks were cancelled because of high winds. The winds weredon't bad, but I expect this had more to do with the park being landlocked with houses and commercial property all around it.   Crowds for the parades are Crazy. The park is smaller which means the parade routes are smaller. Fewer places for people to view   incredible crowding.   Two rides in Disneyland were completely down.   Two rides at California Adventure went down. One of which was Radiator Springs Racers, which kept going down ALL DAY. I complained to Guest Services, but they diddon't really seem to care. They told me that when a ride breaks, they give complementary Fast Pass tickets. I explained that this doesdon't compensate when you are next in line and the ride breaks. A fast pass still ends up being another 20 30 minute wait for the same ride. All in all, it's nice to say I've been here, but I'll NEVER come back. Someone told me that most visitors to Disneyland are locals, and that's definitely how it felt. It was run more like a local hometown park, than a major production like the Magic Kingdom. Whenever we leave Disney World it truly feels like a magical experience. Unfortunately, I cadon't say the same for Disneyland. ",2
"Only visited as my partner had never been and wanted to go ( we're both over 50)Anyway you queue for everything, an HOUR to meet Mickey, obviously just for little kids, buy the parents have to wait aswell, the rides are terrible, except Indiana Jones (average) all food and drink is way overpriced, I dodon't think I would have enjoyed it when I was 5 nevermind 50.right that's it wont waste time on it.",2
"There are too many night things going on ,so that it's hard to get around because large crowds are sitting around for hours waiting for the 5 nightly events that happen in the space of 2.5 hoursBut people are lined up for 3 hours before thatGetting around is very inconvenient for those that dodon't want to see a parade etc Disney staff use to be good with crowds but not anymore",2
"We visited Disneyland, Anaheim with our 2 daughters on 18 May, Monday with a lot of expectation. We were traveling from Bangalore, India on vacation and Disneyland was one of the top attractions of the trip. However it turned out to be a disappointing and tiring experience for us and the children alike.I can go on for an hour about the experience but this is a short summary  1. We did not go on Sunday to avoid the rush and queues but it turned out to be a day where every show ride had at least a 30 mins. wait time, not to mention the 95 100 mins wait time for Space Mountain and Star Tours in Tomorrowland   not something we were prepared for.2. Out of the 9 hrs we spent there, we'd have spent about 2 hrs having fun and rest standing in queues   something very difficult for small children.3. Our daughters were excited to meet the Disney characters, they had seen and read so much about them   the long queues with up to 50 mins wait time just to take pictures with their favourite characters, ruined that excitement.4. There were characters like Cinderella hurrying past weaving through the crowd in Fantasyland. By the time we could tell our daughters 'Look Cinderella' the characters disappeared from our view. We were told the characters will be in a hall in Fantasyland where we could meet them. By the time we reached there it was 6 pm and we were told that the characters have left for the day. Disneyland is open till 10 pm, how can the characters leave at 6 pm?5. We missed quite a few important shows because of 6 7 hours of standing in queues. Later we learnt that there is a system of fast pass wherein we could avoid the queues for some shows by showing up in a specified time window. We had spent 30 mins at the Disneyland entrance in the morning speaking with multiple Disneyland executives trying to find out the best 1 day tickets for us but nobody told us about the fast pass system.6. Any to top it all, there are no parades on Mondays and a few other week days. We had missed that information. So no parades for the children. We left the park around 11 pm and we did not see any fireworks as well.Overall, I am disappointed with our 'first' visit to Disneyland. I had read about Disneyland in MBA school. I had promised so much to the kids. And all we did was stand in the queues   well, mostly. The shows and rides were great but the crowd (on a Monday) really took everything away. This was our once in a lifetime trip (and expensive at about $100 a ticket) that went wrong.",2
Way over crowded and unless you sat along the parade route early afternoon till parade started Disney employees would hear people along the side walk and not permit people to stop and watch. Overall I am very disappointed in the way Disney is now operating. Lines are huge for food; rides and two see characters. A lot of the mentioned previously was at least an hour or up to 2 hour waits.Finding think this is what Walt had in mind when Disney was created.,2
"To allow a huge crowd, making it impossible to cover the entire park in a day because of long queues and then make one buy a 2 day or 3 day pass is cheating, I would say.One has to wait upto 80 minutes for a 90 second ride   that is useless.Some rides (infact 3 of the most popular 4 rides were closed).I would not really spend almost 100 dollars for this!",2
"Hello, my name is JoAnne. I wanted to write and let you know how disappointing our Disney experience was this time! We brought our friend down to celebrate his 83rd yr. his bday was actually on April 30 but chose to go to Disney on the Tues because it's generally quieter, more room for his electric cart. We arrived early to the park, stood around and waited for the characters to come out and wish us a fabulous day in The Happiest Place on Earth and nothing happened! Very sad and disappointing start! After all my hype about the beautiful colourful parades, THE BEST way for him to see all the characters, only to learn there is NO parade!!!! Not a day one, not a night one, nothing! Again, we were all disappointed! THEN, we are told NO fireworks over the castle either! Everything that makes a Disney experience complete was not there! So very disappointed!I know you probably dodon't care, you have millions of visitors daily, making millions of dollars daily but I just wanted to voice my feelings! We came 2000 miles for this experience! He never even got to SEE Mickey because he was in an area where he coulddon't go with his cart! And because there was no welcome in the morning , no parade day or night, he never saw the characters her grew up with! I was very sad and disappointed for him and the rest of the group! There was one other Disney first timer with us also! Disappointed!I do respect the fact that it's OFF season so perhaps an off season rate should be offered or at least paying customers should be made aware of the lack of attractions at the time of purchase! We were not! And, I did hear a lot of unhappy people around me disappointed when we were all told to leave our spots on Main Street were we had been waiting for the parade! SAD!Thanks for listening to me and hope this Disney experience doesdon't happen to anyone else! I'll guarantee it wodon't happen to me ever again!Joanne",2
"Unfortunately, this is not what it seems. Dodon't waste your money. Instead get the free Fast Pass for whatever time the show is that you want to watch and purchase your dinner where every you would like to eat.My family recently went on a trip to Disneyland and purchased the On the go dinning package, with the expectation that we would be  guaranteed  better viewing spot than the people who simply get the fast pass. NOT THE CASE. We arrived 30 minutes prior to the show and we were literally stuck behind a tree with all the people who got normal fast passes and diddon't pay for the dinner experience. Not to mention the fact that the food was sub par. The lasagna was rubbery and the chicken was dry. You were given only 3 options and you're forced to have to pick a time that is well before the actual show time. We had a 9pm show and we had to eat our food at 2:30pm.When I addressed this matter with the  leads  they were NOT helpful nor was the manager at  City Hall  on Main Street either. I was ignored and told I would be helped and the person never came back and then when we went to main street  City Hall  the manager Ricardo was not helpful and extremely rude.From what I could see the show seemed very enjoyable but I was beyond upset that I paid for this experience and was told that I was paying for the food. NOT the case I was paying for my food and my tickets. It seems like it would be worth it if you had better spot to sit but there is no guarantee that you will see anything.AGAIN I STRESS DOdon't WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!!",2
"We specifically went to Disneyland to ride Indiana Jones as it's not in Disney World. Right before we went on, it broke. They gave us a fast pass to use it later in the day. It was never repaired. Sleeping Beauty Castle was closed off because they were filming Americas Funniest Home Videos. The Matterhorn was still being repaired since January. We complained about our Indiana Jones experience specifically as we knew it would be closed for repairs starting on Monday (we went on the Friday before). The cast member said she can give us a fast pass for indiana jones for the next time we come to the park as compensation. I thought this was a joke and we were on Americas Funniest Home Videos. I told her it could be 10 years if ever we return to Disneyland as we frequent Disney World. Her answer to that was no problem, it will still be valid 10 years later. She had absolutely no customer service skills or a functioning brain. Skip this park and go to Universal Studios when in California. All of their attractions actually work, are superior and the employees went out of their way for us.",2
Overpriced. Rude staff And no place to sit. Ill Never go to Disneyland again. The beach is So Much better! Disneyland is Awful! Everything is DO EXPENSIVE. Old run down park that needs to be Completely renovated with all the Millions they are profiting Everyday. Terrible Amusement park. Awful Staff! Awful pricing on Everything! NEGATIVE STARS.,2
Visited on a Saturday and Monday non holiday weekend in February and it was simply too crowded to enjoy. I would hate to see what it would be like on a holiday weekend. Battling the hoards of people in order to try and get your money's worth can bring out the worst in us. One man called my wife !%&$  White Trash because she had several children with her. I guess he was fed up with waiting in line all day too. Good thing I wasdon't present at the moment or I would be writing this review from prison. The kids said they would rather go camping than go to Disneyland again. What a relief.,2
Park was over crowded although we ordered our tickets in advance we still had to wait in line   what's the point of will call?Lines were often 120 minute wait and fast pass is okay but doesdon't really help cause you cadon't keep running around from one side of town to the other side with 2 kids.Food is so overpriced and is mediocre fast food at best.,2
"Should have the ap My Disney Experience. Simple ap that improved the trip greatly would be easy to implement. Staff not as friendly as Disney World..... hello princess  etc ( my 4 yr old diddon't have same friendly experience) No princesses or characters anywhere, no one to take photopass pics only got 1, everything required fast pass from a machine, lines long, Just did not compare to Disney World. Ca Adventures was better.",2
For the amount of money we spent at the Disneyland parks the rides should be in better condition than they are. Every big ride broke down at least once while either on the ride or in line and several were not open at all. Some of the attractions like the jungle cruise and pirates of the Caribbean are old and out dated for an animation company you have work to do.,2
"I took both my vacationing teenage grandchildren, the Matterhorn was down for a scheduled repair, went to Indiana Jones to find it was broken down, stood in line 1.5 hours to ride thunder mountain, went to Space mountain, in line for an hour before it broke down, $93.00 each, not the happiest place in orange county. I cant even talk the kids into giving it another try.",2
"The 5 of us, have been to Disney on Tuesday, the first week of April 2015.A nightmare   that is the 1st thing comes to my mind.This park is just not prepared to accommodate all those people paying so much to go there and definitely expect and deserve much more than that.I   ve seen it with my own eyes. 120 minutes waiting line and people actually waiting for 2 hours (mostly exposed to the hitting sun)!.Space Mountain got jammed twice, Mattorhorn and Peter Pan were closed for refurbishing We   ve been to Disney in Paris and all 4 theme parks in Orlando. We were expecting it to be just as great, but were absolutely disappointed.",2
"Having visited Disney world in Florida on a number of occasions myself and my wife were finally looking forward to visiting the original home of the magic in California during our march California road trip. Well where to start I would have to say if you've visited Disney world in Florida then I would give the California parks a miss, there is little or no magic that is in abundance in Florida I cadon't put my finger on it we so wanted to love it but it turned out to be a chore rather than a pleasure from the queuing to the staff, the tiny nature of the park the lack of organisation compared to Florida it was a real shame and we left wishing we had not visited and still therefore thought it would be magical because that it is not.",2
"I recently visited the original Disneyland for a day having already been to both Disney World and Disney Paris. This was the most dated and boring Disney I have been to   but sure there's a certain magic about it, I imagine for children of a certain age and especially little girls this park will still hold some appeal. Disney adventure is the otherwise better park of the options at this location. I'm 27 so I'm really just looking for good rides not people in suits and overpriced food and drinks. The prices are disgusting and the overcrowding was terrible, they need to limit the number of entrance a day. Disney looks like a cash cow being milked for all she's worth at this location and it's too small to not notice the huge amounts of people. There is no escape. Go off season   never go during a holiday with your family or kids, it's simply more stressful than magical. If your a 27 year old straight guy   dodon't bother going at all. Go to Six Flags if you're in the LA area.",2
"I understand cost are going up but now it cost an average family of 5 more for one day at Disneyland then it cost for them to eat for 6 weeks. Hotels have gone up, gas to get there . They are better off going to the beach.",2
"We went to Disneyland with our 11year old son on his mid winter school vacation. This was to be a memorable trip and we had high expectations of visiting Disneyland Cal Adventure parks. Because it was Presidents' week, we understood there would be crowds and line waiting. But imagine our disappointment to find out many of the rides were closed! No one had mentioned this to us when we bought our 2 day park hopper tickets and my son was especially disappointed that we could not ride the classic rides like Splash Mountain, Peter Pan's Flight, Winnie the Pooh, and there was no iconic Disneyland castle to take pictures in front of (instead there was laughable cardboard scaffolding depicting a castle). There was not even fireworks (which we expected for such a busy Presidents week holiday) nor laser light show (Phantasmic?) at Calif Adventure park. We are big Disney fans and have always associated the Disney brand with impeccable customer service. We were very disappointed with our recent stay and will think twice about visiting again in the future. Suggestion: CAREFULLY check DL website so if any of the attractions are under renovation. There was no mention that there would be unsightly scaffolding covering the castle. We paid over $600 for 3 adult 2 day Park Hopper tickets (since our son is 11 yo, we paid full price for his ticket). We felt it was a rip off discourage others from visiting since so many of the parks'  attractions  are closed indefinitely for  renovations. ",2
"You feel you have to take your kids but you'll feel its not worth it. The Matterhorn and Splash Mountain were both closed. Maybe they needed long repairs but to have those closed over springbreak seemed like exceptionally poor thinking. The place was packed and two major rides closed made the lines at everything else almost unbearable. 3 times while waiting, there were announcements apologizing that the wait was longer than advertised. We used the Fastpasses but $400 for a family of 4 for three short waits is not worth it. At Disneyworld, once the evening parade is done, the park clears out more and you can walk on to most rides. Not so here. Still 60  min waits for the couple popular rides they had open. Take the money you'd spend here and invest in Disney stock and you'll feel happier.",2
It took 30 minutes in line and there were only 5 groups of people ahead of us ticket sellers make no effort whatsoever to get people thru...really aggravating startOk I come here every 5 years or so. Every time I visit it seems too many of the big rides are closed.Matterhorn and Indiana Jones were both closed this tripI would have thought that the food would have improved but Oh no ...its just as bad as ever   really horribleIts something that you should see but really the shine has worn off for me Oh and the tickets are $100,2
"Childhood ruined. I was expecting epic. It was a fail. Would be great for kids, but if you are over 10 years old its boring. All the rides and shows are for little kids. The whole of Disneyland and California Adventure combined would fit in the carpark of a theme park back home on the Gold Coast. We thought at least we could watch the great firework show... until we found out they only do them Friday, Saturday and Sunday night. Poor effort considering the cost of entry. Wont be back and dodon't recommend for anyone over 10 unless you are just taking your kids.",2
"We've been visiting Disneyland for over 40 years, however it's lost it's charm for us. It's overpriced and overcrowded. There seems to be too many free tickets being handed out. The park is full of people that dodon't seem to have paid for admission. We paid hundreds of dollars for our hopper tickets. The walkways are covered in garbage. The bathrooms are filthy. Walt Disney woulddon't be very happy with the way the park is run now. The merchandise that is sold in the stores is all cheap made in China products. Food is poor is Disneyland but fairly good in Downtown Disney. We wodon't be going to Disneyland again.",2
I was here for two day's this march and this was the first time I have been disappointed. I know that there were Attractions that were going to be closed but once inside the park there were other Attractions closed that were not listed as closed on the website and on the board at the gate. ,2
We have visited Disney World numerous times but always wanted to visit Disneyland. We should have saved our money and gone back to Florida. Our park tickets from Florida weredon't good for California so we had to buy new tickets. Many many attractions were closed for refurbishment or some other reason. They were late letting us into park on early admission days. Many rides then diddon't open until well after the public was let in. I love Disney but California was way more expensive than Florida and nowhere near the quality of Disney World. Disneyland is not as friendly or as organized as Disney World. We were very disappointed.,2
"This place is a rip off. Overpriced for the unsuspecting vulnerable tourist . Have visited this place, and the other Disney properties many times over the years. Always known for terrible food and high prices which were cheap prices by todays standards. The review posted by the former employee amusement park reviewer critic is insulting. Some are not former hosts yet allare entitled to their opinion if the goods and services met or did not meet their expectations for their hard earned dollars spent. The reviews are written on the trip advisor site that folks can think for themselves and weigh if this  what we would consider a plastic, half  operating magic kingdom really worth the investment of time and money. All this is not to sparethe public, but to inform them that they can make the decision if this is where they want to go and if this is what they want to do based on experiences of others.Clearly for some of us it is not.",2
"Highlights, Space mountain (always amazing) Pirates of the Caribbean (classic), Thunder Mountain (fun), Indiana Jones, Cool   painful, It's a small world (relaxing and classic), Haunted mansion (still magical). Not worth the price you pay. $155 for rides to be closed. Rip off! Not sure how families travel here! So expensive. I would rather go to Mexico for the same prices. Followed this trip up with a visit to Las vegas, and saw more Disney characters there. Breakfast at Goofy's Kitchen was cool. Way overpriced, but at least got to get a photo with the characters and good food. You can skip their photography for $40 and just hand the photographer your phone for photos. Fireworks at the end of the night was cool. I guess I just dodon't care about the new Disney characters. Just not the same. Good for kids, lame for adults. ",2
"This is the letter I  ve wrote to Disneyland about my family  s experience .. I haven  t receive any answer .. :(To whom it may concern:My name is VR. and last year, (April 12 19, 2014), my family and I traveled together to Los Angeles for the first time. (We are from Guadalajara, Mexico.) We took our two children, my mother and sister. My mother and sister had never traveled out of the country, so we were very excited for them to have this experience. Our son Denji is disabled and suffers from Trisomy 22. He is 14 years old yet is mentally like a 1 year and a half old infant. He suffers from a severe cognitive disability and even though he walks, he cadon't do so for a prolonged period of time. He also suffers from a form of autism, making him very sensitive to stimuli and becoming easily anxious. We were aware that it would be a tough trip, and for that reason we were prepared with all the supplies we would need including his carriage and a whole lot of patience. On our first day, we went to Universal Studios, and the entire staff made our day fun and pleasant, providing us with all the necessary accommodations. Since my son cadon't go on the rides they gave us access through the back door of the rides and permitted us to do the  child switch  when necessary. The staff was also very kind, wishing my daughter (who was turning 9) and my sister (who was turning 17) a happy birthday and giving them candy and treats for that reason. Universal Studios set high standards for us, and after learning about Disney's exemplary customer service standards during my Master's Degree in Marketing, I expected a high degree of customer service during our visit. Even after informing myself about all the recommendations for people with disabilities on the Disney website, I would've never imagined that our Disney experience would be quite the opposite from what everyone knows to be a  Disney experience .When at the Disney California Adventure Park, the staff did not allow us to the child switch or even allow one of us to be in line for our entire party. If my son could only understand that the rides are not dangerous or that being in line for a very long time poses no threat to him, we woulddon't have had a problem in waiting in line as a group, but due to his condition, being surrounded with people in a line makes him very anxious. The only solution that we were offered was a FastPass for him, and they specified that it was mandatory for him to go on the ride per se. We used it as much as we could, but after a long day and after being in a long line to go on the  Cars  ride, my son had an anxiety attack. We told a staff member about the situation and asked her to please allow us to do a child switch, for after being in line for so long and due to the time it woulddon't have been possible for us to get in line again. She did not allow us to do the child switch and unfortunately that impeded us from enjoying that attraction. It's not that we are inconsiderate parents but we're also parents of a 9 year old girl with no disabilities, and with all the hopes and dreams of going to Disney. We had to divide our family into two separate groups, and unfortunately Disney made it more complicated. The majority of the staff members diddon't greet us and few of them wished my daughter or sister a happy birthday; thing which they awaited with expectation. What I wish to ask from Disney is to reevaluate your customer service for people with disabilities and consider that there's not only one type of disability, being the inability to move, but rather different degrees. If Disney could only be more responsive to the needs of families like ours, we woulddon't have suffered from this terrible experience, along with other families who may have experienced similar situations. I understand we're a minority but we also wish to enjoy from special moments at Disney like others do. We sacrificed many things to make our trip there and it's a shame that we went through all that in  the happiest place on Earth , where customer service and marketing techniques are said to be exemplary. This April we will be going to Walt Disney World in Orlando. I truly hope that our experience will be much different... Thank you so much for you time and consideration. Sincerely yours, Vania RochaP.S. I saved the FastPass they gave us. If you shall need it for proof I will gladly send it to you.",2
"I love Disneyland. I always have. My parents took us once a year when we were kids all the way up through our teens. I can buy into the  magic  that happens here and occasionally I'll even come home with bags of Mickey crap even though once I've left the hypnotic pull of pixie dust Mickey doesdon't fit into my daily life. However, this trip to Disneyland was such a big disappointment. Of course, the tickets were outrageously expensive   a family of five being about $1,000 for three day park hopper passes   but given the meticulous care and effort Disney gives to maintaining the grounds and it's image you understand why. On this trip though, so many of the rides were shut down   Small World, Matterhorn, Peter Pan to name a few. There were restaurants that were shut as well. Very frustrating when you shell out a lot of money, this is your kids' first time going and you know that Disneyland isdon't a trip that my family can afford very often. Maybe because I have very young children now the insane length of the lines for the rides and the wait time takes all the joy out of the experience. It's not magical when you have to wait for trams to take you to the park, wait in lines for security to check your bags, wait in line to buy tickets, wait in lines to have your tickets checked, wait in lines for rides and wait in lines to eat. Disneyland is now more work than it's worth. ",2
"I have been to Disneyland several times over the years. However, during my last visit I found the staff to be shockingly rude and inattentive. It was as if they were angry to be working that summer day. I found the service at the coffee shop to be terrible. I was left standing at a counter when there was no one else in the shop. While waiting several other customers came in. When I asked for help I was told I now had to go back to the end of the newly formed line. My wife thought I was overreacting until a different cast member actually spoke to her in a very rude manner. This was not the Magic Kingdom of my past experience. I go out of my way to be polite. Thus, I was shocked to be treated so poorly at a place known for its hospitality.",2
Visited in February. Cost $600 for 4 people for ONE day admission to Disneyland and California Adventure. SO many attractions were closed between both parks it was ridiculous. Took my dad because he had never visited Disneyland and was so embarrassed that it was so Mickey Mouse . I understand the need to perform maintenance but when so many are closed down prices or something should be discounted. Fast passes ran out before 2 pm for many attractions due to overload of the ones that remained open. No characters in either park. Went to City Hall to ask if anything could be done to reverse fast passes but we were told nothing could be done. Safe to say we will never visit Disneyland again nor will we encouraging others to visit  so many better ways to spend money other than to contribute to this colossal corporate robbery.,2
"We spent 2 days here with my immediate family and extended family. It was so unbelievably full of people. I knew it was going to be busy, but it was really difficult to enjoy the park with that many people. Line ups ran 100 mins or more. The first day we were able to get our fast passes in the morning and we got times for 9:30pm. Some of the staff at the restaurants were absolutely done and diddon't provide good service. The second day we just gave up, most rides were out of passes. I'm happy to say we all came back measles free from the recent outbreak. Lesson learned, we will never come to the Magical Kingdom for Christmas. I think it'll be another 5 years before I can consider coming back after that experience.",2
"My fianc   and I are huge DisneyWorld fans and we have gone every year for the last few years. because we were in LA for a little bit, we wanted to check out Disneyland and were really excited to visit another Disney park. Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed.First of all, the tickets were overpriced. While Disney is known to have overpriced tickets, at least at Disney World, there are so many things to do for all different ages that makes the ticket well worth it. Disneyland, although it has two parks, is extremely tiny in comparison. Meanwhile, the tickets are priced just as high with no justification.The Disneyland park is very similar to Magic Kingdom but on a small scale. The Sleeping Beauty castle is extremely small in comparison to the Magic Kingdom castle, and it doest not seem or feel like the focal point of the park. The park has some similar rights to Magic Kingdom like Peter Pan's flight, and Thunder Mountain. The other rides there are mostly extremely childish and while it may be fun for families, for young adolescents and adults who want to go, its quite boring. The only cool thing about the Disneyland park were the Villain characters that were out. We saw both the Snow White Queen and Cruella Devil which was pretty cool. Other than that, Disneyland was literally a smaller, less exciting version of Magic Kingdom. Disney's California Adventure also felt like it was more for kids than it was an all ages attraction. While there were definitely more rides at this park, and more geared towards adult as well like the roller coasters in the Pier, and the coaster in Cars, most of the rides were pretty basic. The Hollywood Tower of Terror was not as exciting as the one in Disney's Hollywood Studios at WDW. The Pier was the only redeeming park of California Adventure which was visually appealing. The rides there were cool too and it is nice at night with all the lights on. The Cars ride (cadon't remember the name, but the one where the two cars race) was a neat concept but I felt like the buildup to the actual race fell flat with the cars going only so fast.As a fan of WDW and all it has to offer, Disneyland definitely fell flat for both myself and my fianc  . Perhaps if Disneyland was the first Disney park we ever visited, it may have had more of an excitement for us. We opted out of going to Universal Studios in LA to do Disney, but we definitely wish we went there instead. If you are an adult or older teenagers etc. that are looking for an amusement park in the LA area, I would definitely recommend something other than Disneyland.",2
"If you have been to Disney World disney land is much smaller with allot of the same rides, downtown disney is also very small in comparison. It's also geared for very young kids, and families with young children, if you like fun thrilling rides, go to a different park. When we were there allot of the rides were down for maintenance and all the others had line ups of over 80min wait.",2
"Touted as the 'Happiest Place on Earth'. Well if you love waiting for ours cheek to jowl with others and paying way over the odds for food that you have queued up for for over half an hour then you are a Masochist and then this would indeed be your 'Happy Place'. We were able to go on 1 and 1 2 rides (someone had jumped of Splash Mountain so we had to sit at the top for 15 minutes until someone came and walked us off the ride.) Even with a complimentary Fast Pass the queues were interminable. I ended up giving a family the Fast pass as waiting in queue for hours is not my idea of a Happy Time. Added to this you have to trek all over the park and enter souvenir shop after souvenir shop to find the item you would really like to purchase. None of the staff have any real idea where items may be, surely when Disney are raking in such massive profits they could actually have a stock control system which would enable staff to let you know where items can be purchased. As an experiment in stock herding or Brownian motion Disneyland is quite successful, but never again will I be a guinea pig for them.",2
"Went the week before Christmas, it was okay. I was not impressed with the decorations or really our overall visit. The kids did not have a great time. I am not sure we will actually ever go back. We spent way too much money for the kids not to have the time of their lives. My 7 year old daughter, it was her first time there and we were there for her birthday as well, she is a total princess, but really diddon't care for it. I asked if she wanted to go back and she said no way. I will spend my money elsewhere.",2
"Maybe it is because I am 64, but Disneyland has lost it's magic for me. $17 for parking and $94 to get in is toooooo much when you have to wait 40 minutes for a ride. No discount for seniors! We had to walk to and from our car! I will not come again.",2
"We took my 2 small grandkids (ages 6 and 3) to the Happiest Place on Earth for New Year's to enjoy the rides. Got there early and got our 2 strollers, so everyone would make it to fireworks. The first few hours were great hopping on and off rides. By afternoon the place was crowded    okay that's normal. Never could get a place to see the parades    too many people. Late afternoon, you could barely move because they roped off and shut the streets while installing bands. (Hum, I thought this place was about the rides but we stood patiently waiting trying to get across the streets and down sidewalks like the other 85,000  people.) Early evening, people are now body to body against the ropes, rails, and walls. People were trying to push through the crowds and were falling over our strollers against my grandkids. People were angry at being stopped and just being forced to stand in one spot while thousands of others crowded in behind them. Adults were vying on the streets for the best spot to see the NO NAME bands. By 8 p.m. they had closed down the rides because no one could tell where the normally long lines ended or began because every available area had people standing and waiting ... waiting for what? They closed the rides so there was nothing to do but listen to bands    excuse me Disneyland    we diddon't go there so we could take our toddlers to a Night Club atmosphere!!! We paid almost $600 for one day, so we could ride the rides, see the parades, and watch fireworks. My grandchildren only saw the backs of the legs of the people standing in the crowd in front of them who were at a dead halt hoping to see the bands. It took us 2 hours to make it from the Castle down Main Street to the gate. If there had been any kind of emergency, we would all have been crushed by people trying to get out. You expect crowds at Disneyland if you've ever gone there before. I've worked in security and crowd control for years, and believe Disneyland did not have adequate crowd control plans or people to handle such an event. If they repeat this next year, they can advertise Disney's new event and call it a  Frightmare on Main Street !!!!",2
"My family which included my husband, 14yo daughter and my uncle went on boxing day and we were told ther were so full we coulddon't get entry to Disneyland yet but they were happy to give us free park hopper passes to go to the Adventeure park and then be allowed into Disneyland at 3pm. We said yes and off we went. We knew they would both be busy and expected ques , but that was rediculous! Completely ruined our day and our experience. Not only did we have to que for rides as expected, even with the fast pass, but you had to que for food, drinks, tables and toilets, we were so over it. We tried to hang out to see the night parade, but coulddon't even get close. There was no way we were going to hang around for the fountains and firs works. To top it off, it was so cold once the sun went down everyone was looking for any where warm we could. We honestly believe the parks attendance should be capped daily, it was just money grabbing on a big scale. I would hate to have been a kid in a pusher., or someone in a wheel chair!",2
"Customer does not matter here anymore. once they get your money for the ticket their customer service stops. once inside the gates you are treated as you are no one and not important to anyone. they could care less if you spend 5 minutes or 5 hours at the park. they have your money and that is all that matters to them. was our first and last time we will visit disneyland. was a big disappointment for whole family., ages 10 52.",2
The 100.00 a person price for one day at Disneyland is too expensive. The wait is way too long. Disneyland need to add rides so people do not have to wait so long. In today society we want fast and now. I did not see enough characters for the amount of money for one is a waste. If I would have went to Disney land for two days I still think its a waste for the amount of money. My granddaughter put Disneyland last on her list that she liked on our family vacation at Disney land ,2
Was in area for one day only.  Thought we would visit Downtown Disney.  Nope    diddon't make it in after trying to follow confusing signs and no direction once inside one of the huge parking structures.  Wodon't be back.,2
"There just has to be a lesser limit to the amount of people allowed in the park. To spend so much money and not be able to experience most of the things you want to is so disheartening. Our first visit ever to Disneyland for the Christmas holidays and we missed out on so many things, simply because of the amount of people and wait times. If you want to see the fireworks and the snow, you have to be in certain roped off areas that are so packed with people that it is dangerous. I love almost everything Disney, but will not risk a holiday visit ever again. So disappointing.",2
"I've been to Disney many times around the world, but it is so different today. It is not this idyllic world to escape and find happiness like 20 30 years ago. Now, the employees are just as rude and detached from their company as other retailers, the fixtures have aged, the lines are longer, the prices much higher, and the food offerings are terrible. There isdon't the wonderment on kids faces from before, there aredon't the smiles on customers faces, and there isdon't the magic that Disney was  where dreams come true . Disney needs a major makeover and retraining of its employees. Do your one trip with your young kids but then cross it off your list. ",2
"Disney, the magic is gone for me. The people are electric carts, plus the stroller brigade, and the outrageous crowds of rude people are too much. The admission price is like a ticket to hell. I LOVE all things Disney, but the crowds, plus inedible food, actually made me consider buying the VIP tour, just to get on with it, and get out. Next time, I will gladly pay for it & avoid the throngs of rude, miserable looking guests. Magic? no. ",2
"I came to disneyland expecting alot more except what I thought was its way to busy, and way over rated, and way over priced, shows were good thats about all.",2
"Even mid week in November, the lines and wait times are a problem. I am not a fan of paying $100 to enter a theme park, only to stand in lines for so so rides and $4 waters. Yes, it is Disney and the kids do love Disney...but, after a few hours even the kids were begging to go back to Knott's Berry Farm. This is probably our last trip to Disney. We will be taking many, many trips to Knott's where the rides are better, the lines are shorter and the entrance fee is less than half. Oh, and if you are a veteran, Knott's truly honors you with two free admissions.",2
Doesdon't hold a candle to DisneyWorld in Orlando. Very long lines on a Sunday in November. The line just to get into the Disney area such as downtown Disney is absurd. At least it's open till midnight.,2
"Long lines, crowded walkways made for a long weekend then to top it off the fireworks were cancelled.  The characters were only available for short stints then would leave.  We were hoping for more, especially considering the cost.",2
Like the title says. Over crowded and over priced. Went from being the happiest place on earth to hour long lineups unhappy parents and cranky kids. Walt must be turning in his grave with all the commercialism.,2
"We finally realised our dream to take our two young children to Disneyland. Coming all the way from Australia, this was a once in a lifetime experience for all of us. First of all, admission price for a family of four was certainly not cheap, but we did it for the children and we were looking forward to meeting lots of Disney characters to take photos with them and get signed autographs, and see the famous Disney parade at the end of the day, and if there were fireworks that would have been a great bonus. We bought our tickets online on the Disney website before flying over to the US and attended Disneyland on Friday October 10. The park was extremely crowded, even on a working day, with very long queues for all of the rides. Wait times on queues took 30 60 minutes just to clear, but we persevered. Then things started to go downhill. Queues to meet Disney characters like Mickey, Minnie, etc were also very long, and by the time we got towards the front of the queue, we were told Mickey had to go for a break and will be back in 20 minutes. So that was wasted time queuing up. We decided to move on instead of wasting another 20 minutes for Mickey to return and figured we will come back to meet him again later in the day. Unfortunately this same thing happened with other characters as well and by the time we got around to coming back to find the characters we were told they had all finished for the day, so we only got to meet Minnie and Cinderella, and nobody else! We even bought a Disney autograph book at the start of the day and only got two signatures in it. But we tried not to let that ruin our day so we kept on trying to enjoy the rest of the park despite the huge crowds and long queue times. Unfortunately, that attempt to enjoy ourselves got cut short when it was announced the park was closing early that evening due to the Mickey Halloween Party and unless we had previously paid for the Halloween Party we were basically being kicked out early despite paying FULL ADMISSION PRICE for the day. As a result, we DID NOT get to see the Disney Parade nor any fireworks, which is what my daughter was mostly looking forward to. We left the park feeling very ripped off. I overheard several families around us also saying the early park closure was a shock and they also felt ripped off. I lodged a complaint to Disneyland and they said all the information around park closing times is shown on the website so it was basically  buyer beware . I made a point that it would have been more useful if the information was shown on the online ticketing webpage where people go to buy their tickets online because there was no such information shown. If I had seen such information, I would have certainly not chosen that Friday to attend the park. In the end, all they could offer me was a park revisit but that is useless as we have already returned to Australia. It diddon't even occur to them to offer a partial refund as compensation. So in summary, you will still pay full price and not get the full Disney experience and they dodon't care. Very disappointed and combined with the long queues, overcrowdedness and the way they can just change hours on you and still keep all your money, Disneyland is not the happiest place on earth at all. Save your money, this place is overrated.",2
"I was disappointed this time around. They have made changes to many of the rides, and not for the better. For example, the Haunted Mansion was once a great experience with the look and feel of a classic haunted house. Now, it looks more like a kid's toy store with brightly colored props and very tacky colors. It no longer has the look & feel of a classic haunted house. The Indiana Jones Adventure has also changed for the worse. In their attempt to pack more visitors in a shorter time, they removed at least one important experience, namely the part where he hangs from a rope and says  Back up!  Then, there was a large round boulder that would roll toward the vehicle; this has been removed, and all he does is hang by the rope with no rolling boulder. These are just two examples of how Disneyland has changed from a great theme park to something much more tacky. I no longer look forward to visiting the park, which is very disappointing.",2
"ALWAYS! crowded.  Always!   Everything is expensive. The rides? Not that great except  The Matterhorn   Space Mountain  or  big Thunder   Big standing in LINES for HOURS? and OVER $125 to enter the park?    PASS!   too much, for too little!   Sorry Mick mick!   OVER IT!",2
"We were excited to make reservations to eat at Blue Bayou Restaurant inside Pirates of the Caribbean, Disneyland Park. We made reservations the day after we reserved our trip. We had eaten in California Adventure a couple times in the past, but we haddon't eaten at Blue Bayou and heard it is a must due in the Disneyland Park. We were so disappointed. First of all, we were given the table closest to the door, and right by where the server station was at. We could hear the servers all talking about their guests and we were as far away from the d  cor in the restaurant as was possible. We were seated and a female server came up and took our beverage order. She said, I'm just filling in for your server who is on his lunch break. He'll be back before long. We saw a man lurking around the tables around us, taking orders bringing them beverages. But he never once came near us. The kitchen brought out our food on a tray covered with food warmers, and sat it near our table. It must have sat there for 5 to 7 minutes before the server came near it to bring to us. The busser had even come over and looked at the food and you could tell, kind of thought about serving the food, but thought better since its the servers job. Food was pretty good over all. We diddon't leave hungry. But we diddon't leave a big tip either. We wodon't eat at that restaurant again, next time we go to Disneyland Parks. We'll try another one.",2
It's disappointing that it is so crowded and impossible to meet princesses or characters without a huge line. Diddon't even meet Mickey or Minnie on our visit. Not what we expected at all. It's disappointing for a little girl who wants to meet princesses and they are not easily available at all. She had to run after Daisy Duck just to get a hand shake. overall disappointed for our once in a lifetime visit. Diddon't see lots. Diddon't get to ride the monorail because it was either wait in line for that or wait to see the parade. So we saw the parade. If you want to see Elsa and Anna this is your only chance.,2
"This is my 3rd visit to and the 4th for my husband and we both agree that it has been a real disappointment. We come from Malaysia and have always had the best impression of Disneyland CA over all the other Disneylands around the world. This year we bought our tickets online before flying in as we were bringing our family and wanted to make sure they have a great time only to find out upon arrival at the gate that the park closes 3 hours ahead of normal hours to make way for Mickey's Halloween Party. There wasdon't even an option for us to get our Halloween tickets as they were all sold and, to make things even worse, Halloween goers were allowed into the park ahead of party time making the already crowded park even more crowded. I think the least that Disneyland could have done would have been to informed us via email of the event and given us the option of haing our ticket upgraded than to leave us in the dark.",2
"After recovering from the $500.00 admission for myself wife and 3 kids, we were looking forward to a nice day, but there were so many people you could barely walk. Wait times for rides were outrageous, the occasional fast pass they issue helps, but they are few and far between. To be fair everything was clean and well maintained majority of employees were nice. I would not go back, the expense and the limited amount you can see when the park is that full just drains the fun. At the end of the day we couldnt get out of there fast enough.",2
"I mean what can I say. It was a basic theme park. I thought Disney was supposed to be magical and for $300 it was very just ehhhh. The parking situation was terrible! The shipped us to a convention center about 15 minutes away meaning it wasdon't until 45 minutes later that we finally made it to the park. We waited for 15 minutes for the Beauty and the Beast show to start and the curtain opened, the narrators began to sing and then curtain closed and they told us the show was canceled. I mean really, that's terrible disappointing for a 3 year old. The pizza was really bad and $8 a slice. I mean Little Ceasers makes better pizza. I felt like the employees there weredon't that nice. It was just not the happiest place on earth.",2
"We figured October 9 would be a quieter time to visit Disneyland but we were very wrong. Most of the popular rides (Space Mountain, Pirates) all had an hour wait. We waited in line for over an hour for Splash Mountain which broke down, so we diddon't get to ride. Indiana Jones Adventure also broke down and the Matterhorn was going at half capacity. Autorama was the pits (no pun intended) We stood in a waiting area that did not move in half an hour. It seemed as though they were having a shift change and unless you had a fast pass you did not move. We normally love Disneyland, but this visit was a total bust and has put us off visiting again. We did think the ticket price was very expensive, but as it was a family day we decided to do it anyway ($93 per ticket). We will think twice about going again.",2
"I am more and more disappointed with this attraction: the value for the money gets worse every year   tickets or seasonal passes are becoming quite expensive, long lines take the fun out of the rides, chaotic crowds make the place less and less enjoyable every year.",2
"The lines were very long and several rides were breaking down which was very disappointing when you waited 45 minutes in line and you get excited about getting on the ride only to find out that it is broken. This happened on Splash mountain, Thunder Mountain, Haunted House, Screamin and Indiana Jones.",2
"Worst day of out USA vacation and we expected so much. Tickets cost a fortune to get in. Fast Pass system gets you 2 or 3 at the most per day as time between ticket issue and use was over 3 hours. Queues for the major rides were all well over 75 minutes, and the smaller  kiddie  rides were all over 45 minutes. Spent the day in lines for boring rides that would be rubbish if not in Disney. California Screaming and Tower of Terror are the two redeeming rides in the park. Unless your kids are really into Disney, skip Disney and do Universal, Magic Mountain and Knots Berry Farm instead.",2
"We planned our annual trip to Disneyland to coincide with a slow time.. we dodon't like the terrible crowds during the summer months, but like to see the Halloween decorations.. the first week of October shows as one of the best time to go to avoid crowds and enjoy the park.. We checked the Disney Calendar and online for any other events.. when we arrived we were totally surprised by 'Gay Days at Disney', hosted by Disney... why wasdon't this posted on their calendar! We have nothing against Gay Days.. but the crowds made it the busiest weekend of the whole year (based on several Disney employees).. They even closed several attractions because they were  at maximum capacity ! We were really disappointed! Mark this on your calendars if you are planning a trip.. first week of October NOT a good time to go!",2
Disney are trapped in a nostalgia vacuum where they are no longer seeking to lead the entertainment market rather relive Walts glory days. By all means keep the Tiki room going but balance the historical with some kind of contemporary offering to show this entertainment experience does not only exist in rear view. Time to embrace the Epcot tradition and think 2030 not 1937. ,2
"This was the 4th time I have been to Disneyland and the least impressive. For a place that often has hot weather there isdon't much shade and not many places to keep cool. We were there mid September in the middle of a heat wave. When you've forked out over $1000 dollars for your family to be there and have limited time you are going to go regardless. We had been to Disneyworld 4 years prior and even back then they had way more air conditioned places and water vapour sprayers to keep people cool in the long lines for rides. We thought we might try and beat the heat one morning and go to a magic morning. What a joke!! That just entitled us to either join a queue for Disneyland that extended right across to near the entrance to California Disney or queue up early for California Disney to open. We decided to join the shorter queue and stand in the sun for half an hour until they opened the gates to California Disney. Only to find when they opened the gates that diddon't mean they were really letting you in early. They had roped off all the entrances to all the lands within the California park and diddon't open them for another half hour. The happiest place on earth pretty quickly became miserable with a thousand people standing in the sun for another half hour with crying, whinging children wondering when they could get out of the sun and onto a ride. The only saving grace for Disneyland is the new Cars ride. Other than that if you have the choice between Disneyland and Disneyworld choose Disneyworld every day of the week. It's better run, not as tired, the staff are friendlier and happier and given that there are more worlds the queues are shorter.",2
We got the two park combo ticket which cost over $150 per person. Parking also cost $17.A lot of the rides were stopped for half hour periods & kept breaking down presumably down to such high temperatures. We queued for over half an hour for the haunted house to get to the front & be told there were technical difficulties & to come back later   felt we wasted a lot of time & diddon't get much back. As so many rides were down the ones that were running had large wait times. The park also closed earlier @ 8 on the day we went due to the halloween special. Having been to the one in Florida i felt that is better which combined with the lack of working rides probably spoilt the experience for me. ,2
"Spent four days recently & I am not sure if it was the weather, but the employees during my visit this time around seemed as if they were bothered by running the rides or being asked questions. Even though we got to get in the park an hour early there were rides that were closed until it was opened to the public and the lines were worse with this extra hour. I wasted an hour of sleeping in! Do yourself a favor and bring your own food and plenty of water or else you will be paying $4.00 for a bottle of water and so much more for food! People spend so much money to wait in line and fight the crowds. Not looking forward to getting back to this not so happiest place on earth anytime soon.",2
"As I wanted to go to somewhere child friendly, I had decided to take a trip to the place of wonder that is Disneyland.Upon arrival I was greeted by a gigantic Mickey Mouse and Daffy Duck. This freaked me out to be fair. I looked around in horror as to say  come on guys, does nobody else see this?! this is genuinely horrific  It was unpleasant to be blunt.But when I finally walked in to those oh so hallowed grounds I got it. I understood it all. It was as if every single event that had happened in the entire history of the world finally made sense. Every tiny little thing. I even bumped into rapper Flo Rida who was with his family, I thought he'd be really nice but nah, he was proper horrid. Really abusive.It truly is a place of wonder. I'm not even milking it. I wish I was, but no, no I am not.The only thing that might have been TOO much on the  wonder scale  is the frozen body of Walt Disney in the underground dungeon I came across. That was beyond belief but I had heard that was a thing so I shoulddon't be surprised. No wait, I really should, that's just mad.I did see whilst leaving the dungeon that the scientists at Disney were unfreezing, or defrosting, Mr Disney hence why I was leaving.He started to point at me with his crusty hands and shout  stop aryan traitor!  in his Vincent Price voice. But it probably wasdon't a Vincent Price voice but just imagine how much that'd suit him.Aside from that though, 2 10 because although place of wonder, without sounding attention seeking, that ruined my day.",2
"We haddon't been to Disneyland since before the turn of the century and it will most likely be another 20 years before we come back again. We've been to Disney World and Disneyland Tokyo and this was the worst of the three. Guess we've been spoiled by Disney World. We've gotten use to getting our photo's taken at the end of rides and then having the photo either sent to our hotel or the front gate to be picked up after we're done for the day, but not at the end of Splash Mountain, we had to pack it with the rest of our purchase to the front lockers (located outside of the gates) and stash it there until our departure. Two of the rides that we wanted to go on were closed for  Decorating    cadon't they do that at night when the park is closed? It would also be nice to provide the  Military Discount  tickets at the gate, especially if you have no way of getting to a base to buy the discount tickets. Also, we diddon't find that many photographers as we found at Disney World, they are usually tied up with the characters inside, not the outside ones. We diddon't bring a camera besides our cell phones since at Disney World since there's always one there. We wodon't be back for awhile here.",2
"We came all the way from Europe to Disneyland , cause my 4 year old sons wante to see Mickey Mouse so so much and me myself have read several Disney books, where they explain their usiness concept, customer service etc ...  We saw Mickey , that was good , son was happy . But to be be honest, the whole park seems to be out of date , we really excpected so much more, and most of all, customer service s totally avarage , I even heard one of the employee talking bad language , good that my son doesnt undestand english :) .Day before we went to universal studios , and folks in Disney , tehy are really 10 year ahead of you , in everypossible way.....",2
"To me, and this is only my opinion, Disneyland is a little overrated. It was a very hot day yet there was limited shade. Where there was shade there were vendors or stores selling stuff. We diddon't have any kids with us so that May have made a difference. But for $96 for a one day pass....not worth it!",2
"The Cast members where not what I remember them being like, few smiled, only 3 commented on buttons and ears. The cast members have last their magic that Disney is known for, It was like going to an over priced theme park.",2
fastpass system doesdon't work and involves hours of waiting as you can only book 1 ticket every 2 hours,2
"the fastpass system doesdon't work, you can only book 1 ride every 2 hours and when you get your ticket at each ride you have to come back in an hour to get to the front of the queue.",2
"It was very disappointing the treatment of staff though is a place for children. Very rude and not polite. The day before that we went to Universal Studios and the staff was really nice, polite and helpfull.   The food is very expensive and small portions",2
It is not  5 yrs old little kid friendly at all like the hype would have you believe where Disney Land is for little kids. Long wait times all around! You're not missing anything by avoiding this park.,2
"If you've been to Disney World, dodon't bother with Disney Land as they're identical duplicates unfortunately & we preferred Disney World. It is not  5 yrs old little kid friendly at all like the hype would have you believe where Disney Land is for little kids. Long wait times for even the crappy rides!",2
"Cmmon Disneyland. You guys can run laser shows on water screens, use some real good technology and STILL cannot figure out a way to manage queues??? Really, 120 minutes wait time? and you proudly display that on screens?? May be you want to sell popcorns, soda and icecreams BUT that is a cruel way of marketing things. Other than this I cannot think of anything that can prevent you from getting a solution for this. With decades of data available one would expect you guys could have predicted footfalls with much greater accuracy. And plan accordingly. Thats a big big let down and it just demolishes repeat value for your parks. I had just driven 400 miles for this park but cannot imagine anyone flying 4000 miles just to visit your park. Although that's how its marketed 'happiest place in the world'.",2
"Having been to Disney World in Orlando many times, I was curious to see what Disneyland was like. It was a real disappointment. Several rides were closed for scheduled maintenance, but then while we were there, Pirates of the Caribbean (my favorite) and the Matterhorn shut down with no real explanation. We finally gave up and went next door to California Adventure. You can definitely tell that it is a newer park, and very well done. Disneyland, we wodon't be back.",2
i used to live down the street from Disneyland back in the 1980's..went there once..was very small but I had been to Disney world several times before going there...went back last year to take my 5 y o daughter...very crowded..most of the people were rude..long lines to go the rides and this was after using the kiosks to go ahead..only went to Disneyland and not to California adventure...I will go back in an off season  time,2
"grad nite! no more like nightmare grads .  smoking pot , popping pills & being totally disrespectful & the better of the rides were broken",2
I paid over $400 to take my 2 daughters to Disneyland and California Adventure. I think Walt Disney would be rolling over in his grave if he saw how overpriced his park has become. What made it even worse is that we wasted 4 hours in the evening waiting for rides that eventually broke down just before we made it to the front of the line.,2
"This was very disappointing and not because it's smaller but because the staff does not have the Disney Spirit. Not friendly, not helpful, I could not find the mission of a Disney  to Create Happiness  they just diddon't have any of that. Seems to me the park needs a dose os Pixie Dust to bring back the Magic that Disney has guilts it's reputation on. ",2
"Not that I want to sound like a downer, but the first thing which really annoyed me was the ridiculous amounts of babies in prams getting pushed around in a place where it's more suited for children who actually have an understanding of Disney characters and can actually ride on the ride attractions. For myself I'm old enough to appreciate the place itself for the joy it can bring everyone which it did for me but I was expecting some thrill rides which they dodon't really have in either parks which was a let down for myself but I shoulddon't forget that Disney is more about the movies and characters. For kids this place is great but not for babies! If you dodon't like crowds I woulddon't go during peak season. I was lucky to go after spring break (in April 2013) had finished and diddon't have to wait too long for rides. I'm looking forward to going to the Disneyworld in Orlando next May 2015!",2
"I have been to Disneyland 6 times in my life at various ages and this was the first trip taking my own children. The magic has changed. Here are the challenges:Crowded. Disney has become a hangout on the weekends for the residents of OC and I totally understand that, it is in their backyard. That makes the weekend days literally packed to the point where you seriously cannot walk down the streets.Long lines. Not all rides have Fast Passes and some you would think should dodon't.Closed rides. We did not realize know that several major rides were closed. It's a Small World, Big Thunder Mtn, Splashdown, and finding Nemo were all closed at the same time? That left very little selection of the other popular rides which made the lines even worse.Rides breaking. It took 3 days for my parents to finally get on to Indiana Jones because ti kept breaking. I waited over 45 mins inside Indiana Jones while they tried to fix it. Pirates broken down as well while we were on it and waited 45 mins in the dark while they fixed. And Cars broke down too! It was crazy and disappointing not to mention wasted valuable vacation time to navigate the crowds and lines elsewhere.Travelling with kids and thinking you can do the switch out at the front of the line does not always work so be prepared to wait longer so everyone can do the rideNot as clean as it used to beEarly Morning entry did not include some major rides which was frustrating even though those rides are in the open sectionDid I mention long lines?Summary:I guess the condition of the park was surprising. Run down some. The staff still amazing.The food options limited due to closures. The souvenirs expensive of courseThe tourist destination feel gone (at 3 pm and all weekend the park fills with locals)The parade was great despite Cinderella's demotionI miss the gondola, the people movers, and of course not being able to show my little girls it's a Small World. Grrr We really would have reconsidered our trip had we known. We saved a ton of money to take the grandparents away for their birthdays and have our first trip to Disney as a family. So check ahead on the rides. Also go during the week. Avoid the weekends, and holidays and the afternoons when people get off work and school for a better shot at rides and less crowds.At the end of day, the girls loved it still which is all that matters but were worn out from the crowds fast. So many tired, hot, sad, crying, kids there:( and strollers everywhere! Very different if you have not been back there since the 90's like me.",2
"We went to California adventure park and were so impressed. It was magical and could not wait to get to disneyland. Once inside Disneyland it was terrible, old no characters nor were there any professional photos. If you have little daughters granddaughter that love disney princess then recommend. Definitely would recommend california adventure park. ",2
$500 for a family of five for a day out and not one queue under half an hour. Four rides broken including two main ones. Several rides broke down including the Haunted House (several times   kind of removes the scariness for the kids when an announcer keeps interrupting the show). Many rides well out of date now and the place was simply too crowded.,2
"It is obvious that the owners of Disneyland are not spending any money on this park. Buildings are looking a little worn, and need to be painted. 4 rides were broken down while we were there. At $96 person, I do not expect there to be any broken rides! Also, 2 vendors were too busy arguing with each other to notice we were in line for service. Terrible experience!! I will not be back!!",2
"Yes, we went at Christmas; but I've been to Disneyworld at Christmas and it was NEVER this crowded. The problem is that there are only two parks to which thousands and thousands of people can go: the main Disneyland Park and California Adventure. Their gates are right across from each other. Disneyworld has the main park, Epcot Center, MGM Studios, two water parks, a zoo, etc., to which thousands and thousands of people can go. So, there's no comparison to which is less crowded at Christmastime. So, my advice. Just dodon't go to Disneyland. Leave it to the people who have annual passes and the people who live in Anaheim. OR, if you go, dodon't go for the rides. Just go to see the first Disney park ever opened. However, dodon't expect to be able to walk very fast as you literally WADE your way through the vast sea of people.",2
"Our family of six recently visited and we came away extremely disappointed and will not ever go back. Ticket price was $96 person after paying for parking. Cost of food and drinks inside the park was outrageous. We were there about 10 hours and we rode five rides. On average we waited 1.5 hours for a ride. Space Mountain was closed indefinitely. Three of our four kids are 16 year old triplets and we have a 10 year old as well. This park is best suited for kids10 and under. All the rides we rode had a personal thrill factor of a 1 on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being best). Our family agreed that the best part of the visit was the fireworks that night, which were very well done. Disney World in Orlando is far and away the better deal, although it is expensive as well.",2
"The name of this place should be changed to Disneyline Park. We went here for 3 days with 2 kids age 6 and 7. There are so many people there and most of them walk so slow that it takes forever to get somewhere and when you do, the wait times are so long that you cadon't do some of the rides. Even using FastPass every 2 hours made it difficult to do everything. Some of the rides like Cars diddon't have Fastpass available. We used the park hopper and were glad we did. The California Adventure was much better than Disneyland. You were able to get on the roller coaster fairly easy and they also had FastPass and single rider that helped my son be able to ride the coaster a couple of times. One of the must do things there is the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. Even though we had FastPass and we waited for 40 minutes, the ride was worth it. The 3D shows that we saw were also really good. You should make sure you see the one at bugs. Our kids loved that one. One thing that bothered me was that they took our picture when we first came in the park but then kept checking our ID every time we went from one park to the next. I think that when you pay the money that you have to wait in long lines and eat overpriced food, they could at least not harass you every time you come in the park. Despite all this, I think the kids had more fun than not so we would  consider  doing it again if on the west coast.",2
Park was dirty. Four of the main rides were either closed down or closed numerous times during the day. It's a Small World (closed),2
"Paid for 2 One Day One Park Passes as my granddaughter, who lives there has a premium annual pass. We chose DisneyLand as our  Park  because we thought it might be less busy. We spent a lot of money for 3 rides venues for our 6 hour ordeal. Many rides not even in up and running, and the Temple of Doom ride broke down after being in that line for over 30 minutes for which we were told  it will be back up soon, sorry for the inconvenience . We checked later and found out it was a good thing we diddon't wait any longer than 10 minutes because it never got back to  running  as far as when we left at 5pm. Disney is a rip off unless you just want to continue to supplement the annual pass holders, or you have a strong desire to pay a great deal of money for merely people watching. It is sad to see the park we honeymooned in some 45 years ago and were made  happy , fade into just another money making scheme. Why in the world will they not put a reasonable cap on the number of attendees into this park. I was blown away that the Day Pass for One venue (DisneyLand) costs 96% of a Ben Franklin! Oh, and did I mention parking? You wodon't get much change from an Andrew Jackson. Oh, and did I mention there is no  Senior  discount, or any other discount available at the door. It is still beautiful and colorful, but the ambience of  fun  is no longer there. Walt would be sorely disappointed in the manner this park is run.",2
"I have been to Disneyland numerous of times and I am so disappointed as to what has come to. The prices are way too expensive. Fast pass or not, you are still waiting in line for at least 1 hour no matter what ride it is. It doesdon't matter if you have kids or just adults, it's not fun for anyone. I would save up the money and go to Disney World instead.",2
"The park just simply can not handle that many people. Not to be rude but why do so very many people feel yhe need to bring babies to the park?!?! Everything scares the heck out of them, people just stop in the mitdde of foot traffic to tend to the baby, they leave them all over the place and 1 2 the parents are too busy texting to discipline the 5 yr old that is pushing the baby in the stroller all over in front of people. Leave your texting life at home and enjoy the park...maybe baby can stay with grandma for the day? Disney...rethink max occupancy!! ",2
"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Disney fan who's dragged my family to Disneyland once (sometimes twice) a year for the last 25 years. Our last few visits have been okay, nothing stellar, but after our visit this year, I think I'm finally ready to hang up my Mickey ears. We visited the first week of June and were surprised to see that Space Mountain was down for refurbishment. Why woulddon't that take place during the off season? In addition, there were prolonged breakdowns of Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain during the ONE DAY we visited. So we headed over to California Adventure, only to find that California Screamin' and the new Radiator Springs Racers were also down for part of the day, and Grizzly River Run was closed for refurbishment. If I am now paying $150 for a one day park hopper ticket, I have some expectations that the rides will at least be working. With all the big rides down, everyone was funneled into the smaller rides, so lines were extremely long.We expected Disneyland to be crowded, but it was absolutely bursting at the seams, and every pathway was congested by 11:00 a.m. We had planned to stay and watch Fantasmic, but the crowds just became too much, and we left at 7:00 p.m. The overall cleanliness of the park left something to be desired as well, with dirty bathrooms the norm, and trash noticed along Main Street. The quality of the merchandise has gone downhill, too, as we found nothing worth purchasing in any of the stores. My daughter was particularly disappointed that there was absolutely no Olaf merchandise (from Frozen), which you think would have been everywhere. Overall, it was a disappointing trip, and the entire family concluded that we did not need to visit there again anytime soon.",2
"Went here after trip across the USA. Having visited Disney world in Florida we were very disappointed with this park in relation to Florida.About a quarter of the size, and the castle is tiny, hence very packed expensive and limited rides and attractions. Only spent 7 hours there as there were not enough interesting things to do.Dodon't waste the time and money....Spend the airfare and get the full experience.",2
"I was so excited to go to the happiest place on Earth with my four kids just a week ago. We did prepare for our trip by using ridemax which helped a lot. We were able to ride almost everything. I would never ever recommend someone go to Disneyland without a plan set out. We saw only 2 characters during our 14 hour visit. They clearly do not have any kind of crowd control going on because it was busier there than Disney World at Christmas! The employees are not as friendly as the cast members at Disney World. In fact a few times they were just downright rude. As we got our hands stamped to leave an employees said to my son,  Hey KID, its THIS WAY!  and thats just not what you get at Disney World. The cast members there (disney world) are taught to treat customers with respect even if they are small. It was not magical and it was way over crowded. You'd think that for as much as they charge to get in, they could manage the crowds a little better. If you hate crowds you will definitely want to skip Disneyland. We were at the front of the line at rope drop and we went straight to Peter Pan's flight and the line was already wrapped around the building. It was total Chaos there. During the parades you are shoulder to shoulder. Once you've been to Disney World, Disneyland is just one big let down. We got to the fireworks an hour early and had to sit almost all the way to the buildings on main street and then we walked straight to fantasmic and there was no seating left. The employee we encountered there was also rude. If you want the experience of Disney but cadon't make it to Disney World then by all means go just make sure you go EARLY and have a plan (I suggest ridemax). If you want a truly magical experience, skip it and fly to Orlando instead. I am glad we got to mark it off our bucket list but we will not go back.",2
"CROWDED. We had a family member who had not been. i dont think i will go back. long wait for rides. for 90.00 per, i would rather  visit knott's berry farm.",2
"I am a DVC member and visit Disneyworld at least once every year or two. I have always found it impeccable. I assumed that would have been the same for Disneyland. Oh, so not true. I recently visited for 2 days. The first day, I went at night around 8:00, since the park diddon't close until 12;00, or I thought. It was open but 3 4 of the rides were not running. Many of the restaurants were closed. We went to pizza plaza, and they were closing at 10:00. I entered at 9:45 and you could visibly see the staff was not happy about that. The pizza was cold. Most of the other counter entrees were closed. Most disturbing was the attitudes of the staff. The floor looked like it haddon't been swept all day. I coulddon't wait to get out of there. Unfortunately, the staff attitudes are the same among the employees throughout the park. I felt like I was at islands of adventure when schools were taking their trips. Although there were many families there,MIT was overrun with obnocious teenagers and everything was out of control. The cast could care less on the rides while they are part of the experience in Florida. Who was yawning, and who Was yelling at kids not to do certain things seemed to be the run of of the day. We went to California Adventure the following day and found it to be cleaner but that was in the morning, but there was no difference in the cast demeanor. It just felt like they diddon't want to be there,It's hard to imagine how different the two resorts are. Save your money and go to Florida.",2
"The park itself is lovely and very detailed, but it seems like it is run down by the management.A lot of the main attractions were closed for refurbishment or other reasons when we were there. Among others:  Finding Nemo ,  It's A Small World ,  Indiana Jone's Adventure  and  Pirates Of The Caribbean .While we tried to enter  Innovations  the fire alarm went off and the building had to be evacuated.After that we were waiting in the sun for an hour to go for a ride in the  Matterhorn Bobsleds , only to be told that there was a technical failure and it woulddon't continue for at least another half hour.By noon it got very crowded in the park and it was almost impossible to enter any of the remaining major attractions without Disney's Fastpass or standing in line for hours.No fun at all.",2
"Traveling from out of town, Disneyland is not a cheap venture. Slightly frustrating but the kids loved it.Keep in mind a few things, park hopper tickets are $150 per person, food is terrible and terribly expensive, none of the carts will give you water, rides are breaking down randomly and frequently. Does the cost of just getting into the park justify the experience... Just barely. Bring your own food and understand that the math is not in your favor. I.e. I drove from Arizona with my family of 4 and diddon't have to pay for a hotel, in conclusion (and being very frugal) we rode 15 rides, dived that by the cost of everything (gas, tickets, parking, food, very little souvenirs) the total expense per ride was $42 a pop. Ya... Sink that thought In after you ride mr toads wild adventure.. The breaking point for me was, we were directed to park in the  lot  this is not the garage were there are trams to take you back and fourth. At the end of the night, we had 2 sleeping children in our arms walking all the way through down town Disney to finally reach our car and it (I kid you not) took an hour to get out...I can not wait for my kids to be of magic mountain age.. ",2
"We use to go to Disneyland. This park is out of control way to many people and the cost is in insane, How can average paying people go here anymore waste of money..",2
My family went here on early May and nearly half of the rides were closed for routine maintenance getting ready for the summer season. Not only was this disappointing for the kids and adults alike but there was no discount in the entry fee. As so many rides were closed the ones that were open were overcrowded with huge waiting times.,2
"We had a 3 day pass for Disneyland and our visit was planned for the week after Spring break to make sure that we avoided the crowds. I have visited Disneyland twice before, once 25 years ago and then again with my husband 7 years ago so I certainly have something to compare this visit with. My husband and I had a two day pass 7 days ago and we got around all of the rides on the first day and went back the 2nd day to ride the ones that we really loved another time or two. One of the rides that we loved was Space Mountain with its fast rollercoaster and scenery of the Universe. I think we did it 3 times back then. Well...those days are over.The crowds are so dense right from the long wait first thing in the morning as you queue to get your bags checked and then queue again to get your ticket checked. Took us over an hour to get in the gate and the same thing happened on the Magic morning pass   queuing for over an hour just to get in and this is supposed to be a quieter time! Once in, more crowds, so dense that walking along the pathways is reduced to the speed of the crowd. Strollers and buggies clog up the walkways as we tried to navigate between them to get our fastpasses. We managed two Fastpasses on the first day but the third one required us to return 5 hours later in order to use it and the standard queues at the rides had reached around 1 1 2 hours standing time so on the first day we only tried out 3 rides and gave up in the end.The next day, even with the magic morning pass, the queue for the Matterhorn Bobsleds was over an hour once we got off our first ride and the queue for The Cars ride was an hour and a half. I dodon't know what happened to the Space Mountain ride since the last time we were on it but we had the initial Warp type laser set up and then we were in pitch black for the whole of the 3 minute rollercoaster ride...what a fizzer. On the third day we decided that we would head straight for the Indiana Jones ride that had been closed for maintenance for a couple of weeks and had opened again the day before. We grabbed a Fast Pass but it still took around 35 minutes of queuing to get on the ride. The other main queue for this ride was sitting around an hour and a half. Once on the ride it was all fun and games until about three quarters of the way through when it broke down and we sat in the jeeps for about 10 minutes while they tried to fix it. No good though so the ride was closed down and the huge long queue of people waiting all had to reverse direction and head back out....what a waste of their time! Trying to get between parks to book Fast Passes and then return for the rides became so onerous and exhausting with the packed throughways that we gave up and left Disneyland without having been on all of the rides and well and truly over the place. We would not recommend it to anyone even after having done so for years and we would certainly not go back.Disney Management needs to take a serious look at the number of people that they pack through into the parks now and set some limits in order to enable people to be able to enjoy the rides without having the long queue times. Ridiculous to have to queue for 1 hour   1 1 2 hours for a 3 minute ride which basically means queuing the whole time you are there to enjoy about 20   30 minutes of rides in total for a day. Maximum numbers need to be set and then more people allowed in only once some have left. That, or find a way to shorten the wait times for the queues for the rides while reducing the packed and crowded thoroughfares.",2
"We recently visited Disneyland California a trip that we saved up for and that I spent months planning for to ensure the most magical vacation for my family. I asked numerous  cast members  if the time was a good time to go and every one of them replied with an enthusiastic  YES!  It turns out it was as crowded as the times I have visited in June and July in the past. Though the rides and shows were as magical as ever we spent three days there and weredon't able to do half of what we wanted because it was so packed. The food was substandard and some of the cast members were less than friendly. It is sad because it seems that all things Disney have strayed far from the original goal of Walt Disney. It now appears to be more about the money, for an already wealthy big business, than the magic. I understand the concept of supply and demand and that if it were super cheap then it would be even more over crowded but how about limiting the number of visitors per day. One of the cast members told us that capacity for Disneyland alone was 80,000 aprox. that is insane . It was not yet at capacity, because they were not turning people away at the gates, and we could not walk down the street in a group. people were irritable and at times rude because we were trying to do what everyone else was doing which was to get through the crowds. I do not feel like we got our money's worth because of the number of things we did not get to do and the food was not what I would consider typical Disney quality it was however much more expensive than what I remember paying 3 years ago. This all makes me very sad because for me Disney has always been magical. I enthusiastically counted down the days to our trip with the kids only to be so let down. I hate to say that Disney has really lost the magic for me. The curtain was pulled back and the true motive of Disney revealed. If you want to have a fun family vacation in today's economy find some place that needs your money rather than generating more wealth for the wealthy and merely being pushed through like cattle.",2
"Bat day or better known as Goth day out, Some of the visitors were downright scary.. unsavoury family with a Pitt bull on a lead in the park, 8 rides in total broke or closed for repair, One staff commented OMG its such a stressful day lol . much prefer Orlando its paradise compared to Disneyland Anaheim.",2
"Our first trip to Disneyland was ruined by the massive crowds and number of closed attractions. While the California Adventure park was not nearly as crowded as Disneyland, there were still one  to two hour waits for most rides and attractions, and the FastPass availability was either for very late in the day or nonexistent. Disneyland was so crowded, it was impossible to walk in the park, and waits for rides and attractions were two to three hours. So many rides and attractions were closed, as well, including many of the most popular ones. Food prices were actually not too terrible, and the food itself was good to very good. In particular, we enjoyed the Sonoma Terrace, which had some good wines and a wonderful terrace on which to enjoy them. However, we will never return, as the price of admission was a poor value for what we were able to do.",2
"Long lines, expensive food, nothing new and where was Mickey??? We went to Disneyland 5 years earlier and nothing new. What was missing were the characters. Hardly saw any characters and when we did they were only out for a short amount of time. Overpriced and not worth a second visit.",2
I took my 5 year old grand daughter and her mom to Disneyland at the end of April. I was very disappointed in this trip. The line were at least 1 1 2   hours long to be on a ride 4 5 minutes. The weather was in the upper 90's. A lot of the rides were down for maintenance and people were just not real nice. Employees were very helpful but I felt bad for the children having to wait so long to go on rides. I understand this is a very popular attraction but it all about the children and the lines were just way to long.,2
"Was so looking forward to this trip with our 3 kids and disappointing is an understatement. We flew all the way from Manila with this attraction foremost in our minds. 5 major attractions   Pirates of the Caribbean, Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage were closed or was told to get out of line (after an hour of waiting) because the rides had broken down. Whats left of the Disneyland trip after these 5 main attractions. Our kids were heartbroken. Not sure when we will have this same opportunity again.",2
"I waited a couple weeks after returning from our California trip to let my thoughts about Disneyland sink in. We have never been to Disneyland or Disneyworld for that matter so we were novices. We only scheduled one day at the park and looking back on it i wish we had skipped it. First off let me tell all those who are worried about crowds  there is good reason to be. We went on a Monday at the end of April and i have never seen crowds like that  and dodon't want to again. We basically paid $300 (entrance for 3) to wait in line all day to ride four rides. I'm sorry  but that's ridiculous. Rides are fun, but the shortest queue we came across was 90 minutes. Many of the rides were closed for maintenance so maybe that put more stress on the operating rides, I   m not sure. The fast pass did help a couple of times and yes, we got right on the rides, but that whole process is ridiculous as well. This cheerful attitude that is always mentioned in these reviews was not present on the day we visited except by the parking attendant. Maybe i need a fast pass for that as well? The food and souvenirs are beyond ridiculous in price. Amusement parks are supposed to be fun. Disneyland is not.",2
We have been to Disneyworld in Florida 4 times and once in Eurodisney in Paris. Disneyland California was such a disappointment in comparison. Pirates of the Carribean closed. Matterhorn broke down after a 40 minute wait just as we got into toboggan. Went Indiana Jones. After 30 minute wait the ride broke down. Went later on in the day waited 40 minutes got to the entrance ride broke down again. Areas of the park closed for beautification. But above all it lacked the magical experience we have become used to with Disney.Cast members seemed disinterested. Is it not time to replace Captain EO. Played to theatre which was a quarter full. It was so dated. Disneyland California needs major investment. Its a Small World closed. Finding Nemo closed,2
"What can you say about Disneyland. For my wife and I, including parking, was $200.00 just to get in the gate. We went on 5 6 14 on a Tuesday, figuring that school was still in session so it woulddon't be crowded. Boy was I wrong, it was crowded.The following rides where closed: Indian Jones Adventure Pirates of the Caribbean Small World   my wife's favorite Finding Nemo Sub Voyage Sailing Ship ColumbiaIf there going to close rides, I wish they would publish it on their web site in a place that can be easily found.The following rides broke down while we were there. Roger Rabbits car toon spin Peter Pans Flight Haunted MansionWe where in the Haunted Mansion when it went down, just beyond where you get out of the elevator, before you get to the cars. It was crowed and hot. They kept announcing that the ride would start in a little bit. So more and more people came out of the elevator, and it got more crowded and even hotter.The bottom line was it was about an hour before they admitted it wasdon't going to run, they apologized, and promised everybody some kind of Disney Bucks, that diddon't happen either.We did find some rides that worked and some good places to eat, that rescued the day.I do recommend the Soft Pineapple Ice Cream at the Tiki Room, Delicious.",2
"We've been to Disneyworld several times and decided to take our kids to Disneyland this year and boy was it not worth it. Many of the rides were out of commission   Small World, Pirates etc. and wait times at other rides were LONG. We also found it quite crowded. Our kids did not like it too much so that was our first and last time visiting. One positive is the ample parking in the Covered Parking Garage   a nice plus not having to go back to a scorching car at the end of the day.",2
"For a family of four spending $800 for ONE DAY at a park, there should be a lot of rides to be experienced. Sadly, five rides in one day does not cut it. It was extremely disappointing. The Jungle Cruise, usually a 10 minute wait, was an hour. I'm a Southern California resident so I know this park like the back of my hand. My husband and I experienced a first while waiting in line for this ride. Seriously, in the 100 plus times I've been on this ride, I've never gone UPSTAIRS and INTO another building while waiting in line. This is absurd. Splash Mountain was closed. Star Tours and Indiana Jones both had 90  minute waits. REALLY? IT GETS WORSE. THERE WAS A LINE for Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln (the exhibit that NEVER has a line). Needless to say, it was almost a total waste of $800. We did end up just going down Main Street and checking out every store because we just wanted to get away from the mass of humanity. I hate to complain but there are things that have changed at Disneyland.My biggest complaint, and one that Disney cadon't do anything about, is that modern technology has made walking through the park a painful experience. I was constantly getting run into or my toes stepped on because people (young and old alike) were too busy looking down at their SmartPhones instead of looking at where they were going. When it's VERY CROWDED, this is a HUGE problem. I ended up with a torn toenail (I was wearing closed toe shoes) because some idiot walked right into me and scoffed the top of my foot with his hiking boot.ANOTHER PROBLEM: While we waited 30 minutes to buy our tickets, my husband's credit card was declined. Turns out the credit card company thought there was some suspicious activity on the card and temporarily suspended it. While my husband was on the phone talking with the credit card company, the window where we were trying to buy tickets closed. I asked the security guard if we had to go to another line and wait again. Yep, we did. The credit card company re activated my husband's credit card and we had to wait another 30 minutes in another line. The whole time my husband was fuming at a seemingly uncaring security guard. Come on, Disney. This is bad customer service. So is allowing these double wide strollers into the park, ESPECIALLY when there is a parade going on. You cadon't move around well and you get rammed by these strollers because the parents pushing them dodon't have any perspective.Food wise, it was better than usual. We ate at the Bengal BBQ (across from Jungle Cruise) and the spicy kebabs were surprisingly good. Yes, one kebab wodon't fill you up, but we ordered a bunch of different stuff and were very happy with the quality. It is not typical Disney fare. Finally. props to the cast members at Haunted House and Pirates of the Caribbean. The lines were long but the line was constantly moving, which is a good thing. The wait was about 45 minutes for each ride. Food wise, I HIGHLY recommend the kebabs at Bengal Barbecue. Also, the burgers at Taste Pilot (California Adventure) are good. If you have the luxury of making reservations and want a real Disney experience, eat a Monte Cristo (at $25, it's the cheapest entree on the menu) at the Blue Bayou. Note: for a family of four, you wodon't get out of here for less than a $100. If you can afford to splurge, eat at Napa Rose at California Adventure. It's outstanding. Local resident tip: If you happen to visit this park in December, dodon't miss the ride It's a Small World. They change all of the doll's costumes to reflect a winter theme. ALSO... check out the fire station on Main Street with your little ones. You can decorate holiday cookies with the firemen and keep the cookies!",2
"Disney is a terrific place with lots to commend it. Parades, shows, people, organisation all very good. However 6 rides closed in Magical Kingdom and 2 rides in California Adventure park very disappointing. Even worse was that other rides kept breaking down. Yet the ticket prices were the same high prices. Sad to say but despite lots of things to credit the park on this is no longer value for money. Too expensive to have so many rides out of action at the same time and all the other ones including some of the newer rides (like Cars) breaking down and being closed for long periods during the day.Also a hint if you are just going for the fireworks display, then save your money, and go to an Angels game on a Saturday night. Fireworks there are spectacular and beat Disney easily. You can get outfield tickets for about $15 to $20 I think. We paid $30 for semi decent seats but we wanted to see the game too.",2
"We went with the kids, if you are around, I guess you have to go to Disneyland. It is clearly not worth the money. In a private conversation I would use other words, but not in a public forum...Far too little rides, even if all of them worked   which they diddon't. Substantial parts of the park closed for renovation. The rides as such are not exciting. The waiting times horrible   I guess, you could try to change something, but it would not suffice anyway. We waited 30 45 minutes for each ride, and that was on a Monday, working day.And you know what? We were there for 5 hours and did not see one single character!!! That is what is in all the advertising and what the kids would have enjoyed a lot, but we met not a single one. And that was the hugest disappointment.",2
"We visited April 27th Through April 30th........a lot of great attractions were closed for refurbishment...which we DID know, as it IS posted on their website (you have to go to the park calendar for this information).....but it was the only time we could go, and it was a trip booked back in January......I understand that there has to be time set aside for refurbishment..and totally appreciate it, but I am not sure I understand why so many of the main rides would need to be closed at the same time....why not stagger popular rides and less popular rides over periods of time rather doing them all at once! yikes!....We have always gone to DL every few years.....this is the first time we've been back in about 3 or 4...and the magic was just not there......it was SUPER crowded, even with a crowd rating of 2 ??!! Strollers EVERYWHERE, screaming babies everywhere, and pushy people everywhere. There were ornery cast members (which I've never seen  ever!), and the park was not as pristine and clean as usual. Things were sticky, and trashes overflowed. And the early morning thing   holy heck! We are huddled into a large mass then set off to run. It's dangerous...and pointless......one extra hour is not enough to do anything anyway (it used to be!). And I was disappointed that fast passes for Racers are gone in just a few hours of the park opening. There needs be a different method. It would be better to limit entry than make people stomp on each other. It would also be better if the park was open longer hours. Both parks, with the exception of Sunday, opened at 10 and closed at 8. Good Grief! On a positive note, this was the first time we were able to catch  The Magic World of Color  and it was awesome.",2
"Dodon't get me wrong, I love all about Disney, the magic, the princess, everything and I'm coming to Disneyland since I was a little girl, but... In the past last years it just seems like is always so packed, lots and lots of people and kids crying and parents getting frustrated everywhere. I have 3 small children, not babies but ages 4 8, it is really hard to keep them happy walking in the heat, waiting lonnnnngggggg lines for every ride. I have a son with a disability, and the past 2 years it was easier with the handicap pass to wait in line, but this year everything is different, they changed everything, so people with disabilities, they have to wait in the sun, like everyone else, they give you this small book and you can ask for a ride one at a time, waiting 1 to 2 hours to go to that ride and Still wait for about 15 min in the heat. Another thing they changed, before, we could go with our son in small parties, maximum 6 per handicap person. Now, it seems like they can put dozens in one party, so, waiting time is longer. I really dodon't know if we are coming back to Disney, I dodon't think is worth the price or the effort. Oh, another thing, we found like 6 rides closed this time, Nemo, Pirates, Small World, Indiana Jones, they should at least discount the price of the ticket if they are going to close half of the park. Really Disney, step it up.",2
"It pains me to write this review. As a child, neither my husband nor I ever got to visit neither Disneyland nor Walt Disney World. 30 years later we spent months planning and saving to take our 4 year old and 2 year old to Disneyland. To say I was excited would be putting it mildly. Both my husband and I were so disappointed. We were in the park April 29 May 2, Disneyland's  off season.  Wow, if that is the off season I cadon't even imagine what a busy season is like. The crowds were absolutely horrible. Crowds dodon't bother me but it was just horrible in the parks. The wait times were unbelievable. It really sucks the  magic  out of the vacation when your toddler and preschooler tell you how much fun they had on a ride and you have to tell them it will be another 45 min   1 hour wait before they can get on another ride and experience that 2 minutes of  magic  again. Opening was absolute chaos. People were pushing and shoving, knocking children over, and running like animals. I got ran over by a stroller more than once. There has to be a better way to handle opening. We had a magic morning and it was the worst day, it was of no benefit. Many rides were closed (more than listed on their website) and or broke down several times.The weather was very hot (record temps for April May), totally out of Disney's control, however we overheard workers commenting on how Disney raised the price on water. Really, come on, do you want families to have a good time (and stay hydrated) or do you want to squeeze every single dollar you can out of them? We diddon't personally notice because we brought our own water every day. Bring your own water!The line to meet the Frozen characters was crazy. My 4 year old loves Frozen, we reenact the movie every day, we sing the songs, we watch the movie   she's obsessed. It was a must do for us. The day we set aside to meet them they opened at 10am. We had Magic Morning at 9am. We lined up at the entrance at 8:15am. We were respectful and walked (not ran, not knocked over children, not pushed and shoved) straight there. We finally met them at noon. In the 2 hours from the Frozen meet and greet opening until we met them they took 3 breaks. The line is in complete sun and moves at a snail's pace. At noon the wait time was over 4 hours. The character interaction was very good I must say, but again being Disney and having done this for how many years, isdon't there more of an efficient way?We did two character dining   breakfast at Ariel's Grotto and Surf's Up with Mickey. I will post separate reviews but briefly   Ariel's was pretty good. Surf's Up was pretty good but I was disgusted at one point. We had purchased an autograph book but I forgot it in the hotel room. My daughter was so sad. I asked for a piece of paper or even the back for a receipt to get some signatures to paste in the book. They refused to give us anything and instead suggested we go and buy another autograph book. Paying $96 for breakfast and they cadon't spare a piece of paper? Wasdon't Walt's vision for a nice place for families to spend time together. An experience like this just drives home the fact that they are trying to squeeze every dollar out of guests and not create an experience. We left with a very disappointed 4 year old! We had to spend time in line at Mickey's house to get an autograph, shoulddon't have had to do that when we paid nearly $100 for breakfast. There were some things that were done very well. The Disney Jr. Live on Stage show at California Adventure was awesome, a must see. The parades (both at DL & DCA) were great. Fireworks were good. The Toy Story Mania ride at DCA was really fun (long wait first thing in the morning though).I would not recommend Disneyland for toddlers or preschoolers. I think that is such a shame to say, wasdon't Walt's vision for the park to be someplace for the whole family to enjoy...",2
"Paid full price for a 5 day Park Hopper, only to arrive from Canada and discover that many of the rides were closed for repair. I dodon't believe full price should be charged for an attraction park that only seems to have the souvenier stores open.Staff were nowhere near as friendly as other times I've visited. On our first day in the park, we waited over an hour just to get our tickets. Several booths are available, but not staffed. For the amount charged per ticket, I would have expected staff to be present.Diddon't see too many of the characters strolling through the park. This was also a bit disappointing, considering not many of the rides were functioning. I dodon't feel I received a good value for my ticket costs.All in all, this was a very disappointing trip.",2
"We just returned from Disneyland. The cost keeps going up, and the value keeps going down. There were so many rides closed: Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, It's a Small World, the canoes, Ariel's UnderSea Adventure, the River Rapids, Alice in Wonderland, and Finding Nemo. Rodger Rabbit broke down, as well as the new Cars Ride. It was close to 100', and they diddon't have any water misters anywhere to help cool down. We literally ran out of things to do, and all the park cast members could recommend was shopping, and restaurants. Yes, let me go spend more money. One cast member told me that I should check the ride schedule before I come so I will know in advance that the rides are closed. What can you do after you've taken vacation days, and purchased airfare? I felt that was totally out of touch with reality. It's a theme park. You go there to do rides. ",2
"Recently went on a trip to Disneyland in Anaheim with the family.Considering how much we spent on 3 park hopper tickets, you would think the  magical experience they sell everyone would be magical.It was by far not very magical at all.They do charge for parking if you drive. We were there with a 3 day park hopper.We went what we thought was slow period after Easter break. That was not the case. First day we were there, the park was very crowded and filled with locals. The park opened at 8 :00 am. We arrived at 7:15 am. Good thing we did. The crowds and lines of people at the gate were horrible.Secondly, the rat race to get to the rides at park opening was absolutely horrible. People were literally running with their children so they could go to the ride of their choice so they woulddon't have to wait in line    and they also ran to the fast pass machines as well. If i had known this was a marathon I would have packed my running clothes. Fast pass machines ran out of tickets in 20 minutes. THe wait times for standby were absolutely terrible later in the afternoon.The sheer amount of strollers and parents who bring their infants    is just overwhelming. They are parked all over   . very hard to squeeze through strollers with screaming children and crowds.Wait times for the Frozen princesses   if you are looking to do that    have daily wait times of 3 4 hours. In turn you see hundreds of tired, crabby, children waiting for hours. Very poorly run. You would think Disney would plan it out better.We experienced much of the same on the other side at California Adventure    their most popular ride is Radiator Springs Cars ride. We had to run to that ride   .because the daily wait times vary from 1.5  3 hrs. While standing in line the ride did stop    it broke down, they got it up and running, however that pushed the morning wait time to over an hour first thing.Unfortunately if you want a low wait time for this ride, your only choice is stay at a resort property and have a magic morning at California Adventure. Otherwise   . the fast pass for the regular patrons is gone very quickly and standby times are very long. If you are a single ride    waits can be from 45 60 min.On our last day at Disneyland we had a magic morning. It was probably the worst of the 3 days. The crowds were huge, the rat race started all over again. People running etc. Only half the park was opening for magic morning. Adventureland and Frontierland was closed. You pay all money for tickets and you have a magic morning   . how about opening the whole park!!! By closing off the 2 areas   . it got even more crowded    and there were more races. Adventureland had most of their rides close for refurbishment   . and the main attraction splash mountain was closed indefinitely due to the weather. The Big thunder railroad was also closed in Frontierland because of mechanical issues.My children left disappointed that some of their favorite rides were closed.THe park food was not healthy, standard amusement park food. Overpriced.Overall our Disney experience was a overpriced, rat race mess. To charge that much money for tickets and to have to run to rides    was not my cup of tea.Needless to say kids got to see Disney and they have no desire to go back .Disappointing experience   . I will spend my vacation money elsewhere    and have a nicer vacation somewhere else.",2
"My husband has never experienced any Disney theme park in his life so on a week long visit to So Cal our friends said that we must take him. (I wanted to go to Catalina island). Alas, we went on a Wednesday. First of all there is no benefit to visiting the website as no deals are to be found and updates on park rides are not present. After paying our huge daily fee we spent the next 12 hours walking huge distances to discover 2 of their major rides out for service and 1 stopped for the day to be fixed. No where on their site did it mention this. Therefore leaving us huge lines for the rest. I was also shocked to discover the age of the attractions, everything seemed so tired. The worst part was our experience to get a photo with Minnie Mouse. On 3 separate occasions within 2 hours, we approached to get in line and were told she would be leaving for her break. Did she ever get one? How many do they get? Are there not more people playing the roles? Yes, it looked like kids were enjoying seeing the characters, eating yummy stuff, and spending the day in the park. But as an adult trip, it was not enjoyable to walk so far to see an attraction. I was expecting so many more rides closer together. The parade was well done, fireworks a big hit, and having a locker helped but our family will never return for an adventure.",2
"Over priced to many rides shut down, will not be back. Universal studios much better. Disney is not the happiest place on earth, people not that friendly.",2
"Just returned from an April 21st to April 24th visit. WAY too crowded! I thought maybe we would miss most of the Spring Breakers but it seems not. We have been to Disneyland and Disney World in previous years, when the kids were younger, and man, what has happened? Over population I guess. It's now just a crowded, run down, big amusement park. We paid extra money (regret it) to stay at a so called on resort hotel ( honestly some Best Westerns are closer than the Disney resorts) so we could take advantage of the extra Magic Hour. What Disney does not state on their web site, nor do the hotels, is that most of the park is closed during this  extra magic hour . So we still end up waiting in line ups. Fantasy Land is the only section open during this time. So Frontier land, Tomorrow Land and Adventure Land you will get to go in at the same time as the rest of the public who are NOT paying $400 a night and more. So you feel like a sucker. We were disappointed that Indiana Jones ride was closed for refurbishment as were other rides. If your Park Hopper Pass doesdon't have a photo ID, bring one to enter the park, they will hassle you about seeing photo ID ( it does not state on the pass that you will need photo ID) Also dodon't forget your room key if you are staying at the resort hotel and are going for that so called extra hour. Washroom: very few in the Disney Park, California Adventure Land is better set up and overall a much cleaner park.Line jumpers. Pretty ugly behaviour we witnessed from mothers with toddlers and young kids. We coulddon't believe it. They would just walked through the line, not offering any explanation, just kept walking and jump on the ride. I think people were too bewildered to say anything. And it happened in every line up we were in. Employees dodon't seem to care or bother controlling this. Basically uneducated staff. Clueless.  So Disneyland, let me ask you this, with the loads of cash you're making, dodon't you think you could pay a few more people to pose as princesses and characters in the Park? 3 to 4 hour long waits to see the Frozen Characters!!?? What a scam. And parents too stupid to walk away with their little kids, who end up crying in line from fatigue and being hot. Unreal. Coulddon't there be 4 or 5 stations around the park with these characters?? Instead of making it exclusive like that? Crazy!! Oh and be ready for the sea of strollers. They take up more than half the park. Strollers everywhere! Do you think your babies will remember this experience? No. Leave your babies at home with sitters everyone will be happier.Everyone grows up with the image of Disneyland being magical. Princesses walking around smiling and greeting kids. Doesdon't happen. They make the castle look huge and grand. The castle will be your first disappointment. It's not a castle. It's pretty much a covered walk way. You walk through it. There are no rooms, nothing to see. And it's way way smaller than on tv. There were no fireworks any of the evenings we were there. A nightly parade, but the streets were SO CROWDED you saw nothing, and got so tired of fighting through crowds we have up.The food is awful and so over priced. Will not be returning. Done with Disney. If you have young kids, remember that kids younger than 7 will not remember much of the visit by the time they are teens. They will get hot, tired and you will be exhausted. Wait till they are a little older. AND..... go in September, October or November. Best months by far. The rest of the year is over crowded.",2
"I have been to Disneyland and Disneyworld several times. It used to be that Disneylands charm and simplicity kept it somewhat competitive with its larger, Florida based cousin. Now, its not even close. Disneyworld seems to have an endless budget to help your kids get lost in the fantasy...especially characters dressed up everywhere. At Disneyland, we only saw two characters the entire day. The biggest difference is that because 'Land is in the middle of the same 20 million people every day, its not just a target destination for traveling families, but  frequent fliers  who are no where near as polite. At allmost every line someone would cut in front, and the employees just watched. It was very upsetting to have your toddlers and children patiently wait 40 minutes, then have to watch (typically locals) people just step in front at the last second. If you say anything, you make a scene if front of your kids. If you dont, you are not a good role model. I didnt pay several hundreds of dollars to have to deal with that...the employees should. As your kids get older, Disney overall isnt as much fun. There are only a couple of  thrill  rides, as compared to other amusement parks which have several.Having said all of that, the park is clean and the kids had a good time.",2
"My husband and I got married in the beginning of April in the Anaheim area. To celebrate our wedding we visited Disneyland CA. Our family was already in the park, when we arrived. When we tried to enter (and after we already paid of course) we were stopped by a Disney employee who uttered some words about a problem with my flowers. I thought maybe they are afraid of my flowers carying a disease that infects their plants? Anyways, a special guy (I call him the bringer of bad news guy, what an awful job) was called in and it turns out that the    real    problem was that we looked too much like prince and princess! Okay, pretty nice compliment, but not great when you look at the consequences. The guy said that in our wedding attire, we would be 'distracting' from the Disney show. So we weredon't really supposed to go into the park. Okay... Not such a great start of the day, as we were waiting there for 15 minutes or more before we were even informed of this. And then the guy asked us if we brought extra clothes so we could change in regular attire etc. Of course we were not carrying any other clothes with us! I was looking forward to making pictures with my new husband in front of the pink castle in my nice dress and him with his suit, and I could see myself showing a picture to my future grandchildren, sitting in a scary ride with my wedding dress on and holding my flowers in the air, but no ... that was apparently not possible. So we told the guy we really wanted to go inside, so I suggested to wear a sweater over my dress and he finally agreed that we could enter the park if I wore my sweater, my scarf and if my husband was carrying my flowers. Well, it was chilly anyway, so I diddon't mind wearing the sweater, because I thought it was good that we at least got to go into the park, as our family members already paid for their tickets and were waiting for us. However, it was a big disappointment that I coulddon't take fun pictures with our full attire showing on the pictures. But, to us, it was more important to get into the park than to make a fuss over it.When we walked into the park, my husband and I discussed why Disneyland would have such a strange policy regarding people coming to celebrate their wedding. My husband thought that Disneyland was afraid of being sued if we would be rude to the children who actually thought we were a prince and princess. I thought it had something to do with all the ads I had seen online, where Disneyland is trying to sell wedding packages (then you have the ceremony and the party in the park), so I thought that maybe they don   t want other newlywed couples to    free ride    and be able to take pictures in the park if they dodon't pay for the full package? I know that in the Efteling, an amazing Dutch theme park that won several awards for being the best theme park in the world, loves having married couples taking pictures in their park. They even let newly weds in for free, because it   s like free publicity for them to see their theme park show up in happy wedding pictures. Also, in the minds of those newlyweds your park is forever linked to the greatest day in their lives. On top of that, people in the park always seem happy to see newlyweds, so it makes for a great experience for everyone, really. In Disneyland, too, people were happy for us and congratulating us. And yes, one girl came up to us and asked if we got married (she did NOT ask whether we were a prince and princess). When we said that was the case, she hugged us and then walked on.My husband had to make a business phone call and so we sat down on a bench. Then a group of about 8 Disney employees comes walking towards us. One older lady tells us that she has received complaints from customers about our behavior. She says that I had taken my sweater off and posed for pictures. She added that they caught us on camera, too. I was really taken aback. I felt really hurt that another customer would have said something like that about us, while it was not true! So unjust! So I told her that a girl did hug me, but that was because she congratulated us with our marriage, and that I never took my sweater off! The woman kept insisting that I did take my sweater off, that we had done something wrong and that we may have to leave the park. I finally said: well, show us the video then. And another employee was joking in a nice way: yes, let   s watch the video. I then suggested they take the flowers away. One other employee asked whether I didn   t want them. I said: of course I want to keep my wedding bouquet, but if I am not allowed to stay in Disneyland, then I will gladly give it up! Then I was allowed to keep it (well, my husband had to carry it still) and they backed down a little bit. When they walked off, one of the employees, a younger girl said that I looked gorgeous. That was nice, but I felt really hurt and distraught at that moment. It was mainly the older woman being mean, helped by the bringer of bad news. But the other employees were half heartedly following the older woman around (her orders, I guess), as I could see they thought it was ridiculous too. The young girl later came up to me and sort of apologized and gave us buttons that said    just married    and some fast track passes. I felt so touched by her trying to make up that all of a sudden I had to cry (and I don   t cry often). It was all the emotions of the day, and then a guest complaining and those Disney employees being so mean. My husband thinks the Disney employee might have been lying about the video images and the complaint coming from a customer, just to pressure us to say that that is what we did.Anyway, trying to get into Disneyland was a really bad part of our day. I wouldn   t recommend it. Celebrate somewhere else. Until Disneyland changes their policy.And why can only children dress up? If I want to be princess for a day, you know when you feel like dressing up and being a kid again, wouldn   t Disneyland be the place to do that? Well, apparently not    Sad. Other than that we had a great day with our family. Some of the employees, especially the photographers were funny and friendly. The rides are nice, but since I can compare to Disneyland Paris, I would say to the Europeans: don   t travel all the way to California to do the rides. They are more or less the same in Paris. And the rides for the small ones, like Snow White and Peter Pan are actually set for a speed that makes it hard to see anything or follow the story! If I remember right, the rides are set to a slower pace in Paris. Also, the Anaheim park seems more busy than the Paris park (we went on a regular weekday), but the lines were not too long (I dodon't think waiting 15 30 min is long). The only thing that   s definitely better in California than Paris is the weather and the prices of food and drinks are not too bad for a theme park (although Americans would probably say it is too expensive).",2
"For a good experience, be there EARLY!! Once the general public starts appearing, it sucks. It's too crowded, little children everywhere, sometimes unsupervised. Not the best place for a couple to go out on a date at lol. If I had to go again, I'll make sure to bring my own snacks and drinks as everything is super expensive inside. Idk, not my favorite amusement park to visit : ",2
"We travel a lot and of course this time was with our two children 8 and 3 years old. This was our 3 year olds first time to any Disney park and our son we have brought four times prior to DisneyWorld. I havedon't been to Disneyland in a long time and maybe I am biased to DisneyWorld. I felt not only did the staff not have the Disney attitude like DisneyWorld some were outright rude. Maybe it was the week we were there, I am not sure but they were not the way you would expect Disney staff to act, I even heard a group of them standing around talking about their personal lives instead of interacting with guests. I expect this from other parks but never Disney. Almost all the major rides were closed so most of the attractions my daughter could go on, Small world, Ariel, etc. she was not able. There were not a lot of options for sit down restaurants in the parks either and the lines were atrocious! I will always stick with DisneyWorld from now on I was so disappointed I am such a Disney fan.",2
"I cadon't believe I'm giving Disney a poor rating. My family and I LOVE everything Disney!My first trip to Disneyland was in 1978   I was 10. It was the greatest place I had ever been. I went back in the early 80's and once again had a great time. This time was a let down.Why was it a let down? The only thing I can say is after 20  visits to Disney World I was expecting the same experience at Land. Disneyland is small and poorly operated.Here are some examples:Disney World $134   1 day park hopper   includes 4 parks Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Epcot and Hollywood StudiosDisneyland $137   1 day park hopper   includes Disneyland and California AdventureMagic Kingdom is the closest to Disneyland so my comparison will be to MK.During the fireworks the castle pass through closes but most rides remain open at MK. We've been on the Dumbo ride during the fireworks   going off right over us.DL there were several rides closed   because of lines they close 1 hour before   losing about 1 1 2 hours of ride time. You cadon't be in line during the fireworks. The castle pass through was also closed.There are a couple of different parades at MK. The day parade which happens two times during the day and then the Electric Light Parade at night. DL had one parade that took place twice   4PM and 6:30PM.Disneyland does have a couple of rides that DW doesdon't have. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride was taken out of DW a couple of years ago. Unfortunately we tried to get in line just about an hour before the fireworks and it was closed   the guide diddon't say it closes. We did ride Storybook Land Canal Boats. Note: they also close during the fireworks but the guide states it closes.A couple of rides that DW doesdon't have are: Matterhorn Bobsleds   the line was 60 minutes long and no fast pass, Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, and Indiana Jones Adventure   they were all closed for refurbishment. Not sure how long they have been closed or will be closed but it seems an odd time (spring break) to close rides. Small World was also closed along with Snow White's Adventure.Another complaint. When you purchase tickets to a Disney park you would think they could keep the characters out longer. Elsa and Anna were only available in DL from 9AM   3:30PM. The Fairies were 9AM   3:15PM and Merida was 9AM   3PM. The Princesses were 9AM   7PM. Even if we only did these characters the lines were so long we would have missed the majority of the park.The Royal Theater according to the DL website have a Tangled Show and a Beauty and the Beast show. There were no shows the day we visited. There was a greeter saying the theater was closed.Some things I found odd: asked for directions and the man pointed with one finger   so against Disney rules   always two or more fingersAsked an elderly worker a question and he was so grumpy. My question was do we have time to look around since it's a 20 minute wait or should we get in line right now? His response,  you have time but if you're even a second late I'm not letting you in . You would NEVER get a response like that at DW.Sleeping Beauty's castle is SO tiny. Not a big deal but......We watched the Mickey and the Magical Map show and that was very entertaining.Another good point of DL is Mickey and Minnie Mouse were out dancing on Main Street. You NEVER see them out of their tent in Fantasyland or in the parade at MK. You can see them at Animal Kingdom more easily.All in all our day was 3 out of 10. Maybe were spoiled with so many visits to Disney World. We wodon't be back.",2
"Waited my entire life to go to Disneyland but pretty sure the entire population of New Zealand was there on the day we went, even though we tried to plan it to coincide when kids were still at school. Took advantage of the magic mornings as we were staying for at the Disney Hotel, and even that wasdon't enough to beat the crowds despite queuing up a whole hour before the park opened for Magic morning.They open the gates and start letting people through but just as you get to the end of Main Street they stop everyone and it becomes a stampede of people running and pushing and shoving. Crazy mothers with strollers just run at you and Except you to get out the way or be mowed down.The queues were about two hour and a bit waits, the food was horrible, we ordered Mickey Mouse pancakes and got a pancake with a tiny piece of pineapple for the mouth and two raisins for the eyes....no maple syrup, no powdered sugar, no whipped butter, it was dry and vile.Fast passes went quickly for Space Mountain which we got on once before it was closed down for maintenance, The Matterhorn was not operational for a good part of the morning!Indiana Jones and Nemo sub marine were also closed. By midday we gave up and went across to California adventureland which is better than Disneyland by a million trillion miles. I wanted it to be fabulous and could have cried I was so disappointed. Flag it and just stick to CA land.",2
"We visited Disneyland on a weekday and experienced lots of lines, estimated wait times at attraction queues that were not truthful, and tons of annual passport holders that descended on the park in the afternoon like an insect swarm. I wrote a letter to Disneyland and the response was rather shocking. They sent along fast passes and invited me to return at my expense again. You can read all about my experience and the letter Disney sent at my dedicated web page about my experience at dizzyland.infoIt is a fun read and everyone should read before visiting.",2
"I bought a few annual passes for my kid thinking about the experience I had 10 years ago.I used to take my daughter to Disneyland for 3 4 years with annual passes and it was very nice.However, many things have changed. The good 1. My kid still likes going to Disneyland.2. It is a safe place. The bad 1. The price is very expensive.(I believe $92 for a single day visit.)  The food price inside the Park is also very expensive.2. It is very crowded. It is packed with people. The wait for a ride is very long.  Maybe because it is during the spring break season. The ugly 1. The attitude of many employees is almost beaurocratic that you are one of many who just come and go. I had to show my ID 4 or 5 times because it was not updated  for 3 days after my face shot was taken. They could take the picture of you when you  purchase the pass but they wanted to save a few seconds of their time. I had to wait  in line to have my picture taken twice. 2. The management turned the Park into a money making machine. The food price is  very expensive and poor in quality inside the Park.My recommendation is to avoid peak seasons and weekends if you have to visit here and have meals before you come to the Park or bring your food to a picnic area just outside the Park.(You can get your hand stamped and come back after your visi to the picnic area.)",2
"Spent a few days at the Park with kids and grandkids March 20 and 21 (Thursday and Friday). As far as we knew it was not Spring Break, and the composition of the crowd did not suggest that schools were 'out'. But the crowds were still overwhelming. The grandkids were 5 and 7. At that age an hour (or longer) wait for most rides is burdensome and annoying. This was our 5th trip so we are not unfamiliar with some secret moves (go EARLY, get Fast Passes quickly) but we also began to rely on a couple of smartphone apps that listed wait times. Problematically the wait times were awful all over both parks after 11:00 a.m.. A couple of major rides were noted on the website as closed for renovation, but Space Mountain also closed without notice for most of a day as did the Toy Story arcade ride. The Park was unfailingly clean, the roaming musical acts were always good for a quarter hour's entertainment, and everyone was well behaved. It was the glazed eyes of the adults that suggested this is no longer the Happiest Place on Earth.",2
"Well we were disappointed with Disneyland cost us $92.00 each. I know it is the original park but it is really showing it's years. Went for breakfast when we arrived bacon eggs  toast total over $30.00 US. yikes!!!! Four rides we went on stopped while on them. It's a Small world is under renovation (wish the person we bought tickets from would have mentioned that even though we did see it on the program after) the Mountain Railroad was closed for a  private party .... and so it goes. The staff were great, the streets are clean.. it is very Disney high end shows etc.. but compared to Disney in Florida... needs updates. I woulddon't go back.",2
"Perhaps I had been spoiled by going to Disneyworld so many times before and set my expectations to that level. However, I was truly shocked at how inferior Disneyland was to Disneyworld. I will say that we did not go to the other park that you had to pay an additional $80 for simply for that reason. It was far too much money and it did not appear to be all that exciting. So we stuck with Disneyland.Our first visit was to it's a small world, it was one of my travel partners favorites. It was closed for repairs. We then went to try one of Doles Pineapple drinks which you can only get at this park, closed for the season. We then went over to the runaway train ride, closed for repairs. And on and on it went. It was shocking at how small it was and how they could charge full price and close half the rides. I rarely write reviews this harsh but this was unacceptable. Especially when you factor in the huge ticket price in excess of $90 each.Space mountain was open and that was fun and there were other rides that were enjoyable. Additionally, the staff were helpful and friendly however the bad far outweighed the good. Perhaps a discount was in order given all that was closed or a list out front of the attractions that were closed so people were informed. We arrived at 10:30 and were headed home by 2pm. A far cry from a visit to Disneyworld in Orlando.",2
"This was a trip to introduce grandchildren to what my children enjoyed years ago when we lived closer to Disneyland. For me, there was little magic. Exorbitant prices for everything, long lines and huge crowds on a Monday during the school year. Perhaps I'm old fashioned , but there must be a way to have more fun, better memories and the wish to return for less money......I wodon't be returning. Sad. ",2
"I never thought that I would be writing a critical review of Disneyland!  Yes, we went in February, but never expected that 3 4 major attractions would be closed.  Very, very disappointed!",2
"Disneyland is truly a magical destination for most, but special needs families really need to think before going there. Their new disabled policy (DAS) does not work well for most. If you or your disabled special needs individual can not tolerate long wait times then dodon't go to disney. Go to legoland, sea world, or universal studios. If you're not ok with having to walk back and forth to the few ride time kiosks they have set up for DAS users, then go somewhere else. ",2
"We paid hundreds of dollars to wait in line for 3 days for maybe 2 hours of actual rides enjoyment. The only way to do Disneyland is if you have VIP access and can cut to the front of the line whenever you want. We got the 3 day park hopper pass thinking that we would be able to see most attractions in those 3 days. We were sadly mistaken. One would think that the last half of February would see smaller crowds. It's after the Christmas break from school and before spring break. Apparently Southern California schools get a week off for Presidents Day. We arrived shortly after the park opened and parked in the Woody lot. we then had to wait in line to get on a shuttle, about 30 minutes. After the 5 minute ride to the park, we waited in another line to have our bags inspected. This was an absolute joke. After the  security  check, we had to wait in yet another line to get into the park, about 10 minutes. We decided to head to California Adventure and get a fast pass for Radiator Springs Racers. By this point, the park had been open for about an hour and the fast passes were gone for the day. We could wait in line for about an hour and a half if we wanted to ride it, but we still had 2 more days. We'd just get there earlier the next day and gt a fast pass. We found a few rides with short lines, mostly in the  Bugs Life , but those 1 2 minute rides still had waits of 20 minutes. We rode 3 rides at California Adventure in 90 minutes then decided to head over to Disneyland. Waited in another line there to get in, then had to wait to do the classic picture at the entrance. The first ride we went to, the Peter Pan ride took 1 hour and 10 minutes to get through the line, waiting on the 85 degree sun. Then the ride was 2 minutes long at the most. We rode the Autotopia ride next, another hour wait. By this point we had been at the park for about 6 hours total and the kids were done. We checked into our hotel, Courtyard by Marriott Anaheim at Disneyland Resort great place to stay for cheap, and rested up for the next day. We go to the park 30 minutes before they opened the next day and waited in 2 more lines to get into California Adventure to get our Fast pass for Radiator Springs Racers. By the time we got in line, it was almost 1 4 mile long. That is no exaggeration. Waited in line for 1 hour and 20 minutes to get a ticket that says to come back in 6 7 hours and wait in line again. So we went and rode a few more rides and came back to Radiator Springs at our appointed time. When we arrived, the ride was temporarily closed and were told to check back periodically. So we had to stay in California Adventure. After a couple of hours, they decided to close the ride for the rest of the day. Then we had to go wait in line at guest relations to get our name on a list so we could come back the next day and get a pass to ride. This part of Disneyland was great. We gave them our name and when we came back the next day, we picked up a pass for 6 people to get on the ride. There were only 4 of us and only 2 could ride at a time (my daughter is too small). We picked up a family of 4 waiting in line for a fast pass and took them with us. Got right on with no wait and then did the rider swap and got right back on again. Star Tours was another great experience. We got the fast pass earlier then waited only a short while to ride. As the doors opened for us to get on the ride, my son said he needed to go potty. When he says that, there is no holding it, so we went to the bathroom and got a pass to bypass the line and get back on with no waiting. Other than that, Disneyland was a disappointment. The lines and crowds are too much. I would constantly hear from other people in passing,  this is ridiculous, it's just not worth it . An hour wait to spend 1 minute with Mickey, sidewalks and streets that are too crowded to walk down, cars and trolleys driving down the middle of the road causing even more congestion. So glad when it was over.",2
"We went on a Friday in winter thinking it might be quiet, how wrong we were. This place was so crowded, especially with strollers! Have been to Disneyland in Tokyo & much preferred it, more organised & handled the crowds far better. Three rides attractions were out of service & 2 more broke down during our day. We queued for nearly an hour for one ride only for it to breakdown before we got anywhere near the front of the line! Parking for the strollers is out of controll & blocks walkways, they really need to better manage them. Came away thinking it was an unsatisfying & expensive day, would not return to this park.",2
"Disneyland is now crowded all the time. Really crowded. Even on the slowest days.Being a fan of amusement parks and in Disney in particular, I researched the historically least crowded days to attend, and threw the dart at February 4th, 2014. But when I arrived, I was shocked to see queue lines snaking into the midways, a sea of strollers, and a two hour wait time for the newest attraction in Cars Land, and even a half a block long line to get a Fast Pass for Radiator Springs, the newest and best attraction. Makes you wonder what in the world will the parks be like on a busy day. Certainly not worth $100, or $130 for two parks. Recently a Huffington post article complaining about the overcrowding showed a shocking picture of the sea of people at Disneyland, crowding the streets, shoulder to shoulder. Reports say Disney often tops out at 80,000 guests. Clearly, there aredon't enough attractions to accommodate that number. There's not even enough room for every guest to sit down. And all these reviews here talking about how  wonderful  and  beautiful  the place is are completely ignoring the huge pink elephant in the room. Overcrowding is so bad, it's likely that Guest Relations would receive an enormous number of complaints from guests not even able to see a minimal number of attractions.The line for the newest attraction, Radiator Springs was 2 hours long. More sobering, the line just to sign up for a fast pass reservation time snaked nearly half a block long! A couple of hours later, the fast pass reservation system closed for Radiator Springs   there weredon't enough reservation times available.Now when there aredon't enough reservation times available to accommodate the guests who have paid $130 to see your park's major attractions, it raises a basic question. What are guests getting for $130? Are they being guaranteed a ride on any of the rides? Are they being guaranteed a ride on the newest attraction at Cars Land? Really, the answer is no. You're not guaranteed a ride on any of the rides, although a Fast Pass helps insure a minimal number of rides, the old halcyon days of multiple re rides on a single attraction, or riding every ride in the park are gone.Looks like from a business standpoint, Disney is going to have to make some decisions about what constitutes an acceptable experience for $130.Having said all that, here are the accolades the place deserves.Cars Land's Radiator Springs is an American triumph in entertainment. The animated characters are so likeable, and the Arizona Red Rocks ride so beautifully rendered, and the ride so thrilling, it is a truly a world class amusement ride experience. Maybe the best character based ride in the history of the Amusement park industry. It's that good.The restaurants in the hotels delivered unfailingly good appetizers and entrees. Really impressive food in the Napa Rose, and in the California themed hotel's bar.On this, one of the least crowded days of the year, I was able to sneak in 6 rides on Radiator Springs in the park's final hour by using the single rider queue. And some wait times during the day hovered din the 20 to 30 minute category. But nothing like what it used to be on a slow day. It made me harken back to the days when you could go to Disney and have walk on experiences.",2
"Went to Disneyland, because I had never been. Discovered numerous rides and attractions were closed, because  it's winter.   Winter  diddon't seem to stop the crowds. Diddon't even have fireworks at the end of the night  because it's winter.  Very disappointed. And the people with strollers will run you over, not to mention the scooter chairs.",2
"We traveled from the Magic Castle Hotel in Hollywood for a day in Disneyland at Anaheim. Myself, my 19yo and 16yo sons paid $142 each for transport to Anaheim and entry ($92 included). After we had waited 70 minutes for the first ride we were unimpressed, then 90 minutes for the second one was infuriating. Competing with a slowly moving mass of humanity to get from one attraction to the other was also daunting.There are so called 'quick passes' provided to avoid the queues, but you can only have one at a time   we managed to obtain one at 11am for a 6.30pm ride! So, they are an illusory concession to the queues. The outcome for us was cutting our losses, ' bailing out' at 1pm, and a $140 taxi ride back to LA   the only way to get back there before 9pm (public transport questions were responded to with wide eyed incredulity!)It seems to me that Disney have no compunction about cramming as many people as possible into the park, irrespective of the quality of the experience.Perhaps if you have younger children who are still entranced by the 'Disney Magic' it may be worth considering for the atmospherics. For teenagers   avoid it! It doesdon't cater for them.",2
"I love Disneyland. It truly is one of my most favorite places on earth. But the one day of the year I will forever avoid is New Years Eve. It sounds good in concept: A family celebration that includes the children. But it was a massive fire and safety hazard. Walking in redirected crowds (nearly all places were  re directed ) meant that all parts of your body were touching strangers on every side. At some points the crowds were so compact I was nearly lifted off my feet. I have spent New Years Eve in Times Square and been to one of the most crowded Mardi Gras in New Orleans history and neither compared to the chaos and crowds of Disneyland on New Years Eve. I waited an hour for a locker at 8am. Every bathroom line was a minimum of a half hours wait and the rides were often two hours. It was $30 for a lunch of two hot dogs, drinks and chips. And every employee seemed miserable to have to spend their NYE working. The worst part were all the detours. I cannot begin to recount the number of times my desired destination was 20 feet away albeit across Main Street and I was redirected around the entire circumference of the park to get there. I'm certain I walked a half marathon at least and made about 8 trips around the entire park. Many attractions closed down after waiting in long lines and that included lines to greet characters. Twice our child waited in line over 30 mins to meet Goofy only to have him leave as she was next in line. Two moments of magic worth mentioning: the phenomenal fire works display and the disco music playing loudly through the park once evening began. Imagine 1 million people all clapping their hands in unison to the song, CAR WASH and dancing in lines. That was pretty fun and memorable. The cover band was also impressive. But the crowd control was so poor that it was physically uncomfortable and something I will never choose to do again. ",2
"If you are a Disney superfan then my opinion doesdon't matter. If you are a Disney hater then you already have made your decision. This is my narrow view of my first and only visit to Disneyland based on a 2 day visit after New Years 2014.You know that everything is expensive. You know that it is crowded. You really have no idea how bad it really is until you are in the middle of that mess. It would take coercion and the ability to carry a cattle prod for me to even consider it again.Ticket prices for a day or two work out to about $100 a day. If you want to go for a longer time, it makes the daily costs considerably less per day.It is always crowded (so I am told) but this was nuts. I have nothing to compare it to except maybe the crowd views in New York during New Years Eve. Simply waking place to place was time consuming. Waiting between 45 minutes to 200 minutes for a ride?!? Really??? Many of the rides broke down during the day. You would think they could maintain these things a little better. Considering the cost of everything they should be able to plate it in gold. The grounds were not as well maintained as other Disney parks around the world.There are a few good things about Disneyland. If you like the characters, they are always out to sign autographs and take pictures. They know how to make some pretty interesting rides: 3D, 4D with smells and other effects. They go all out for the holidays and even change some of their rides based on the holiday season. Haunted mansion was fitted with Jack Skellington things for Christmas and Its a Small World was also Christmas themed.The bottom line is that my visit sucked, but their rides and attractions are interesting hence the raiting of 2. I like Disneyworld, but Disneyland was not for me. Your experiences may be different.Good luck and Happy Travels!",2
"First the positives   parade, light show and 2 lots of fireworks to welcome in 2014. All were executed with typical Disney aplomb.The negatives   this event was unsafe, uncomfortable and the D organisation cared little for the basic comforts of the  guests  who paid around $100 a pop to experience the night. I had to argue with one of the  cast  to access a restroom so my daughter could wait in a line for 25 minutes to use the facilities.This was because they were trying to enforce a one way system on the crowd in an apparent effort to avoid crushing.Not my idea of enjoyment   only an illustration of corporate greed.",2
"Avoid the holiday season if you intend to cover a good portion of the park in 1 day. It was too crowded to get into the holiday spirit, especially when we were getting pushed and shoved all over the place (we were a petite bunch) by people who were very defensive of  space . Minimum waiting time for each ride was 50mins in our experience, and we had to limit the rides we wanted to on...",2
"My kids (7 & 5) have asked continously for a trip to Disneyland for a long a time now. They were over the moon when we surprised them with a visit this Jan 2 and 3. But halfway through the first day they declared it was not the best day of their life like the commercials had promised. The park was overflowing, cramped and the lines were ridiclous. My kids spent much of the day looking at butts of other adults. We only got in a fraction of the rides we thought we would and to add insult to injury we lost an hour because my husband and his sister were trapped in the bowels of a broken Indiana Jones and we coulddon't get ahold of them.I'm so disappointed that this will be their first memory of Disneyland. This was not what I remembered from my childhood trips there. Looking around at the sea of people in a relatively small park, I coulddon't help but think that it is a recipe for disaster. Disney is putting their guests at risk by allowing so many in at one time. I realize we went at a busy travel period and I was expecting crowds, but this surpassed anything I had imagined. To put it bluntly, I'm peeved at Disney for not putting quality over quantity. It's obvious they dodon't care about the experience their guest are having, just at collecting those outrageous admissions.We spent the second day waiting 3 hours for the Cars ride in California Adventure when the posted wait time said 2. Crazy. Disney should be ashamed that they're making small children endure these lines. That said, the rest of California Adventure was much better than Disneyland and the park seems to be designed to hold the crowds better. The other thing that was an issue was bathrooms. They seem very undersized and lacking on enough sinks. I've never had to wait anywhere for a sink except at Disneyland. Ha! Maybe they should post a wait time for sinks.",2
"Too crowed went on January 2nd and by 11:30 every line and walkway cramped and bottlenecked, there for 12 hours only got on 4 rides not the greatest experience. Disney world much better and have been there during holiday times and it is much more enjoyable in Florida. Disney needs to learn quality of its guests visits should outweigh the quantity of people it can shove in the parks. ",2
"Visited Jan 3 with family. I had visited in 1968, my wife in 1981, but my grown kids (23 and 20) who have been to Disney Orlando more times than they can remember, wanted to go. So we went.1. It's expensive. $92 for one day ticket. No AAA discounts.2. It's small. The Magic Kingdom is small. This is smaller, lines are longer and overflow on to the streets. They close the park down at times when it exceeds capacity (fortunately not when we went)3. It's crowded. We were told that despite being the holidays, our day wasdon't one of the more crowded ones. At times getting around was difficult. Cadon't imagine dragging around small children. Long lines on all the  feature  rides, well over one hour for Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, etc. The  fast pass  helps, if you use it well. My kids were good at that and we fast passed a few times. Still, expect to do half of what you planned.4. It's Dark at night. Poorly lighted in many areas after the sun goes down. We stayed until late expecting the crowds to thin out (they do, somewhat). 5. It's Old. From the parking to the parade, the place was obviously not designed for the use it gets today and it shows. On the plus side, cast members were very nice and attempted to help whenever they could, even taking pictures of our group, etc. Restrooms were relatively clean, considering the volume of people and lines for the ladies' rest rooms were manageable.The corn chowder at New Orleans was very good. Now the kids have seen it. We dodon't have to go again. Thank goodness.",2
"Went to Disneyland on 31st December, 2013. After going to Disney World in Orlando two years earlier, we were excited to experience the Disney magic all over again.We knew it would be busy as it was New Year's Eve but we were told when we arrived that if the park reached capacity, no more tickets would be sold. This was to ensure an enjoyable and comfortable experience for all. I dodon't know what the park's capacity is, but I have never experienced such a crowded place in my life. It was intense. ProsFireworks were goodIt was easy to get to the park from the car park   via shuttle or a short walk. ConsLines for rides were up to 200 minutes. Long lines for the bathroom.Restaurants required bookings (but this was not advertised)Lines for 'take away' style food were very long, limited places to sit and eat this food. Our 'fast pass' to one ride was available to us between 12 1am. We got the ticket issued at 4pm.Hard to move around the park due to crowding but also due to ropes cutting off access points between areas. We felt like cattle getting moved around, aimlessly going nowhere. The iconic castle was very much the 'poor cousin' to the Disney world version.We left at 1am, hoping to miss the 12am rush after the fireworks, it took over 1 hour to get out of the car park   no Disney staff to direct the traffic. I appreciate that New Year's is a busy time, but our Disney world experience two years earlier was the week of Christmas and it was excellent. If you have a choice between Disney world and Disneyland. It's Orlando Disney all the way!",2
"Me & my family (adult child, adult grandson, baby great grandson, daughter in law), visited Disneyland Park Dec 27th 13, arriving at South Parking Area around 10:30 hrs. Shortage of transfer buses, no seating in loading area, took 38 minutes to arrive at Park. Admission prices about double that which they should be for a day trip. Food & beverages too expensive. Traffic flow to attractions & rides poorly managed. SUGGESTION: Have One Way routes throughout park, starting at The Enchanted Tiki Tiki Room in a clockwise rotation. Restrooms need to be posted better, with signage showing where they are. They also need to be constantly cleaned with attendants on sight. Prior to Fantasmic, employees moved a multitude of Strollers to a sight which was not pre announced, thus panicking everyone. Outdoor lighting inadequate for outdoor dining. Inadequate seating near attractions for those waiting for attendees. In short, the admission price increases do not translate into improved services. The highly paid executives are too greedy, & have lost the vision of Walt Disney. I have been operating group tours to Disney since 1969 by Air, Motorcoach, & Automobile, & have yet to see any of the above problems resolved.Executives know that they have a captive audience, therefore, coulddon't care less about our negative experiences. Shame on they & their attitudes.",2
"When we first bought our tickets for about $300 for the group of us, we were expecting an easy entry with my child. But, they cut off the line because it was full capacity, and that meant since we only got a one day pass, even though we paid for the tickets, we wodon't be able to enter. Lucky my quick thinking rushed us to another line where they were still accepting, so that wasdon't $300 wasted. Or so I thought.As we queued up for our first ride, it took a huge slice (three hours of our entire day) just to go on a little five minute ride. Disneyland had almost no regard for us standing in the baking sun at all. My son was already tired, but to not waste $300, we got on another ride, which was another long and arduous queue. Right now, we had spent $300 and 7 hours of our family's limited time in America for 10 minutes of entertainment (the rides were good though).We were all exhausted and bored, so after that we hustled home. $300 wasted and our energy and day for only two rides. In my photos, it was almost hilarious seeing our son's  excited face  after a ride at Disneyland (sarcastic). Not happy. They certainly should do something about the queues.",2
"I agree you accept its going to be busy when you visit this place at Christmas but maybe a lower quota would be better.Waiting lines for many rides exceeding 2 hours, most for more than 90 minutes, it's not the happiest place on earth.But the worst thing is that the staff all contradict each other and seemingly dodon't know what's going on. In Frontierland one staff member said (when there was a complete blockage) to leave by train. The train conductor said the train wasdon't running. My 2 year old was being crushed so a staff member said to walk through the French Market restaurant. The staff in there said we coulddon't. 4 different stories in the space of minutes. You'd burn to death or be crushed in a fire.",2
"I had just one day to spend at Disneyland and being a foreigner here I researched how to make the most of the day online and went with what I felt was all the preparation I needed,Whilst Disneyland itself was quite beautiful ,it has been very poorly planned.The fast track option was only available for 3 4 rides and that too in the afternoon the wait time for the fast track riders was well over 5 6 hrs which is too long.Alternatively there is little guidance on the timings of the tours parades etc and the crowd too large which resulted in really long wait times at each of the queues...I visited on the 24th of december which might explain the crowds however they had shut down the Indian Jones ride for well over half a day which was quite frustrating.All in all,it was worth the visit but it is also one of the most frustrating places to visit.if you are going over pick a date which is not a peak day as it is just not worth the trouble during peak season!",2
"Disney collects $100 day person, we need better service...the crowd was beyond control but it only showed lack of planning. Kids were suffering because of the mayhem. Please do not go during holidays.",2
"I took the family to Disneyland for some fun, and it was fun the first day, however not so much the second day( FYI dodon't complain to any of the workers there) I seen it happen twice in a matter of an hour on both ends of the park a lady walked up and complained talking normal not rising her voice or being aggressive and asked to speak with someone about a complaint and they called security on her within seconds the old folk security crew was surrounding her so she said forget it and left. Then at the gate where they check bags a lady put her purse on the table for them to check but left the strap around her neck and they yelled at her, yes I said yelled at her then called security when she asked to speak to the manager. I am glad that I paid there over priced tickets so I could see that.",2
Arrived late morning. Parking in multilevel garage was well orchestrated as was shuttle to the park entrance. Paid $274 for all day park hopper pass. Lines were long for various attractions and my impatience was short so left the Theme Park for the California Adventure. Got soaked on the Grizzly River Run and finally got in to the 10min Soarin' over California show after a 15min wait in line with a FastPass. ,2
"biggest disappointment was the rides breaking down after 2   hours in line. So crowded and plus while in line for a ride people were just cutting in front of you trying to  get  to a family member already in line for them?! thats so rude, and first time in my life there were no fire works show. It was crazy crowded, this time of year its my favorute to go to Disneyland not planning on going next year.",2
"We took 4 kids   2 aged 6 and 2 aged 8. The waiting time to get on the major attractions was about an hour. Even the lineup at Starbucks was 30 minutes! Disneyland is old with rickety rides and and trades on its reputation. If you have iPad friendly kids, it's not very interesting. Either go to Universal Studios, Six Flags or somewhere else. If you are going for nostalgia that's fine fine but you'll get over it in about 30 minutes and the kid's wodon't be thrilled. We went on a Friday and it was packed. Not fun. We've been to every Disneyland in the world and you can do better elsewhere than here. I think Wal would also be disappointed. Go elsewhere. We felt we wasted our time & money compared to what we could have done.",2
"If you have been to Disneyland 15 years ago or more, be sure you'll find more or less the same thing today. It's not bad, much smaller than Magic Kingdom in Orlando, but they dodon't improve, they dodon't create anything new. Same rides since ever (95% of them for children) and that's it. When new characters and movies are launched, they simple redecorate old rides with new style and that's it (Haunted Mansion a good example   or the old Pirates of Caribbean with some Johnny Deep included as well).OK, I totally understand it's all about  living a dream in Disneyland  and bla bla bla, but even so I think the park needs to be improved and upgraded.",2
"We took our two 9 year old boys to Disneyland in August. For two days, one park each day, it cost just over $700 in tickets for two adults and two kids. That was entry tickets only. We chose the Disneyland park for the first day. We arrived around 8am and rode the Indiana Jones ride first. As we were exiting the ride, it broke down, so we coulddon't ride it again. The Pirates of the Caribbean was also not working, and the haunted house wasdon't working. We eventually were able to ride Pirates and the haunted house, but when we came back on our Fast Pass to ride Indiana Jones, it again wasdon't working, so we diddon't get to ride it. We also really wanted to see the Abe Lincoln exhibit because our boys love history. We tried to get in, but there was a private party, so we weredon't allowed in. We coulddon't go to the Lincoln exhibit on our second day at the park, because the second day ticket was good only at California Adventure. I diddon't buy the more expensive tickets that would have allowed us to go to both parks each day because I knew we diddon't have the energy to do both parks in one day. I diddon't realize so many attractions would not be working or closed like the Lincoln exhibit. It's also crazy that we'd have to pay more for the two day two park ticket because of Disney's problems! The second day we went to California Adventure. We got there right when the park opened so we could get a fast pass for the new Cars ride. We got the fast pass, but . . . . the ride was broken down. We kept checking the ride throughout the day and finally at around 2:00 pm it was open and we were able to ride it. I felt we paid a lot of money for a frustrating experience. We dodon't expect to go back.",2
"The newest and most popular ride, Cars, broke down 30 minutes after opening at 8am and did not come back up until 730pm.  This is a real disappointment to kids, especially if they cadon't wait over 8 hours for a ride to be fixed.",2
"Not being a native Californian maybe I just dodon't get it, but I would rather jab bamboo under my finger nails than spend another day at Disney. Fake, manicured, corporate is what I see...if this is the happiest place on earth God help us!! My sister and I took my nephews there and what I remember is lots of waiting in line, bad, overpriced, food and a few fun runs down the Matterhorn. Even the boys seemed underwhelmed; the older one said to me  Disneyland is OK, but I'd rather go to the tide pools at Crystal Cove! ",2
"Was not worth the money spent, for the either the limited access and time spent with the princess's or the food. It was premium money for standard fair. Time spent with each of the 4 princess's was less than 2 minutes and the food was just ok. The service staff were very good and quick but it wasdon't $200.00  plus good. For the cost of the one meal we could have eaten at the park every day we were their for the 4 day park hopper. We managed to see the most of the other Princess's and Disney Characters for free and a 30 minute wait in line....so the Lunch wasdon't worth it.Some of the park staff were rude which was very disheartening as well. Due to the time of year of us going to Disneyland the lines were reasonable for most of the rides with the exception of  Car's  ride which takes you through Radiator Springs...which was a fun ride but the weight in line for an hour wasdon't worth the 4 6 minute ride and could have been shortened with better ride management. All in all though the time spent in the park was ok. The Meet the Princess's Lunch wasdon't worth the money spent on it.",2
"$92.00 entry pp, food and drink expensive, and there seems to be substantially more shops, souvenir stands, food and drink stands.Personally I thought it had lost a lot of it's naive charm.Sure there were the rides, but  It's a Small World  and  Thunder Railway  were both closed for refurbs.I was told that Thunder had been closed for about 12 months.The question is; should the closed attractions reflect in a lower entry price??The Jungle Cruise should have been called  The Adam Cruise , as the boat driver simply would not shut up. Inane jokes blabbering on so quickly we coulddon't understand him anyway.Now look I am generally an optimist, really I am, and I have to say my wife thoroughly loved it. So go figure eh?I reckon that the money spend could have been enjoyed more elsewhere   but I dodon't know where.",2
"Took my family of four to Disneyland in LA for the Halloween promotion. This is a partial list of rides that weredon't operating at all, or broke down when we were there:Indiana JonesPeter Pan's flightSplash MountainBig Thunder Mountain Railroad (closed for remodeling)Carousel (closed for remodeling)Gadget's Go Coaster (Toontown)Matterhorn BobsledsMater's Junkyard JamboreeGolden ZephyrGoofy's Sky SchoolI've been to Disneyland perhaps 10 times in the past twenty years, and it was extremely rare for ANY ride to be down in the past. I have no idea what happened to their maintenance, but it was really rather stunning. The people working the Indiana Jones ride told me it had been up and down for days. Often rides broke down after we had waited in line for 20 30 minutes, but before we could get on them. Try explaining that to your child, especially one like mine, who is autistic.But, hey, you can always go on Pirates of the Caribbean or It's a Small World ten times!Other thing   dodon't even think about going to the park on weekends. There is a thing called an Annual Pass, and for the folks that live in SoCal, it's a wonderful deal. For the rest of us, who travel hundreds, if not thousands of miles, to go to Disneyland, and pay small fortunes in airfare and hotel bills, we need to wait in the same 60 minute lines that the family of eight who lives in Ontario does, only they probably came to the park for a few hours on Sunday afternoon because they had nothing better to do.I take my family to a lot of theme parks, and they typically either give you about what you expect, sometimes a bit less, but Disney had always managed to give you more than expected. There really was some sort of  magic  to the place. Not any more. Now, it's a tough slog, and a steady stream of disappointments. Even the staff's attitude has gone way down hill.I know this will probably change absolutely no one's mind about whether to visit the parks or not. And, that's the saddest thing of all   the worst part of the experience was that the parks were TOO crowded! Clearly, Disney doesdon't really need to  fix  anything   or at least, I'm sure that's what the bean counters in finance are telling them.But,they've lost a customer for life.",2
If you dodon't have little kids do universal studios instead and skip Disney. The princess castle was smaller than I expected. It was a  spinal tap  disappointment moment. The only ride that scared us was the tower hotel. No fireworks. Only on weekends. Watch park hours. They kick you out early for private partiesDisney Hotel guest only get in an hour early but you still have to line up and no one gets into the ride area until 10 so hotel benefit is smallUse the fast pass system it saves you time ,2
"On Wednesday, Oct 16th we entered the Disney park at the 9am opening and proceded left to right beginning at Adventureland. The day started fine with the Tiki House and Jungle River cruise and crowd level was typical for Oct mid week and a great weather day. From here it was all a very frustrating and disappointing experience. I should add that I have visited this attraction twice before and have done the FAR SUPERIOR Disney World Florida theme parks multiple times. The sign on entry showed that Its a Small World and Thunder Mountain rides were down....but several more were also discovered to be unavailable for various reasons throughout the day including :Indian Jones, Disney Railroad,Splash Mountain,Casey Jones Railroad,Monorail  Some of these attractions suggested we check back later for availabilty which we did several times in spite of being dog tired from retracing our path. They continued to be unavailable each time.I voiced my concerns to consumer relations management ( Cavan ) at the site at 5:45 PM and was even more disappointed and frustrated at their response.  This was a $200 plus day including entry fee, parking and food and yet 7 attractions were unavailable and I expected some compensation for such a reduced attraction availability. In spite of us explaining we had only that 1 day in the area and that we had already been in the park for 8.5 hours , the Customer Service manager suggested he could grant Fast Pass to 2 of the closed attractions which according to signage in the park were still closed and he wasdon't even aware of the status. He then offered 2 passes to Adventureland for another day even though he was told we were there from Canada for that day only. There were other comments about protecting the safety of attendees and I suggested that was an incredibly high number of issues that proper preventive maintenance should minimize or eliminate. They have from 9pm to 9 am to perform this. The grounds staff are generally polite however the attendant at the Monorail waited for park goers to climb the ramp to tell them   you people came at the wrong time , the ride is now off service for 25 minutes   in a smug and uncaring tone as opposed to going to the bottom of the ramp to advise people and prevent yet another long walk and wait !I think a discount to our entry fee, a park gift card for shops or dining could have been offered if they were truly a customer focussed business but instead we were left very disappointed, frustrated and would never recommend this facility. Another issue that was obvious was location of washrooms are a well kept secret due to absence of signage and only info was on the site map that is confusing and poorly scaled.In total we believe that the self proclaimed Happiest Place on Earth is their opinion and that they are complacent about true service level.We DO NOT RECOMMEND this park in spite of the Disney brand power.",2
"We went to Disneyland at no small expense like many other families! However, two weeks before we departed we found out in the news that the special needs access program had changed. I did a lot of reading and went with a positive attitude. I have to say ALL the staff was GREAT! HOWEVER the program has not been well thought out and definitely not field tested. It was cumbersome and not in the best interest of anyone in our family. There were 6 of us and we had to make everyone happy but it was not the  happiest  place for us. My granddaughter has visual impairments and cerebral palsy. For each ride we had to go back to the kiosk to get the specific name of the ride we wanted. There are only 3 kiosks in the park. This is just a not fancy fast pass but a lack of empathy for the families that really face challenges and just want a  normal  experience. I will not be returning anytime soon with my family since it is obvious that if you have  special needs  you are not really wanted!!! (Just your money)",2
"I have been going to Disneyland for years since I was very young. I am very sad to say that the magic has been lost. Starting with the fact I gave this company $150.00 for absolutely nothing!I have a friend who works at Disneyland and can get discounted tickets to other theme parks, Disney provides this service to their employees. My friend purchased our Disney tickets and another park. Well her partner accidentally left our tickets in our Las Vegas hotel room when we left for California. So my friend called her employers (Disney) to see what could be done to get us new tickets. She had the receipt, but all they told her was,  Sorry, dodon't know what to tell you , and  we cannot replace those tickets because if the original tickets are found and used, we will be out money , I am surprised Disney could ever be  out money . So this is how loyal Disney fans are treated. I am really disappointed because I had already spent so much in the park. I took my boyfriend to the very expensive Blue Bayou restaurant and we spent quite a bit in the World of Disney shop. Really sad they coulddon't do anything to help us and we (the patrons) have to eat the loss. Sad Disney is so overrated! Not worth the ticket prices, if I haddon't gotten the discounted tickets to Disneyland I woulddon't have paid to get in full price and parking as well. You pay a lot of money to get on 10 rides at the most. Some of the lines were 2 hours long. Dodging baby strollers all day. So not worth it. For how much we paid I could have gotten into Knott's Berry Farm, Seaworld, and Universal Studios and still had shopping money! We will be skipping the Disney hype next time. It's true what they say,  Disneyland, a people trap set by a mouse. ",2
"We spent two days at Disney in October. Oct 9 and 10. Oct 10 was Friday. We had gone to California Adventure first and the first, second and third ride we attempted to go on were broken! Radiator Springs Racers were broken at Park opening and we weredon't even allowed to go close   were told to try again in 2 hours, Then tried California Screamin. Broke just as we got in line. Then went to Grizzly river rapids   closed too....Waited 30 min for Soaring over California and went to Disneyland. Rode Star Tours a couple of times and then went to Indiana Jones   30 min line   we were in the underground portion of the line and it stopped moving, lights came on   BROKEN  We were stuck in there for about 30 min before they got it working again. We got kicked out of Disneyland at 7pm so that they could have the Halloween party there. For this trip we paid $210 each for 2 day park hopper tickets   so this day cost us $105. I figure it was about 20 per ride and we got to wait 30 min for the privilege. I think they let too many people in the park and for a tourist paying top dollar it is just not worth it. This was supposed to be a non busy time too. I do not plan on a return visit anytime in the future.",2
"Disneyland is not the happy place it once was.  Plan on waiting in line for bag check, front gate, food, parade, rides, etc.  They need to hire help to stream line some of the process.",2
"I was really looking forward to the Disneyland trip, but I was disappointed. The park is small, it`s way too busy (line ups approx 30 60 mins for a 5 minute ride). The princess castle was small (I thought it would be bigger after watching various adverts on TV). I had a 2 day 1 park pass and I am glad I did not buy a 3 day pass because in 2 days of visiting one park (Disneyland) I was really bored. I will not attend it again in the future. It was also too hot outside (31C in October) and when you stand in lines for half an hour or 45 minutes without any shading, you really lose interest in the rides. I am not sure if my experience would be different if I attended in the winter. I cannot imagine people attending the park in the summer when it is in season. I was told that October was off season, but still it was too hot and too busy. I also think for what it is, the park is too expensive.",2
What was supposed to be a magical 9th birthday trip to the  Magic Kingdom  for our grandson was the most unhappiest trip of all. While we expected to find lines at rides we diddon't expect to have to wait hours for a ride that lasted less that ten minutes! We spent hard earned money to take our youngest grandson on a trip that we wanted to be special for a grandson who has already overcome health obstacles in his young life. This was a trip I would not recommend to anyone. The so called  fast pass  system is only  fast  in the short times that they are available. Finding the location is like looking for a needle in a haystack! Do not eat the food found at the park  not only is it expensive it is terrible. Disney has always been known for their excellent service. This was not true during this visit. The Disney photographers did not even give us a chance to take pictures of the places we wanted to take  we were moved out of the way rudely. The final straw came when the Pirates of the Caribbean broke down. We were stuck for over 20 minutes! Do NOT visit during any holiday weekend! The overcrowding is unbelievable!!!,2
"This place is terrible! The place is crowded, it's so pricey, and you have to pay pay and pay! The lines are long (even the express lines) and everything is for little kids. The food isdon't as delicious and the service wasdon't helpful and friendly. I really dodon't recommend this for a family trip. It isdon't the happiest place on earth.",2
"My family was really looking forward to the Halloween event, but I wasdon't really happy with it. The park was entirely too crowded to enjoy. The lines for candy went on forever at most places. Stood in line for near 45 minutes in Toon town for the candy line. The parade was nice, but diddon't see the headless horseman they advertise. The lines for rides were long just like any other busy time of the year. I will not return for this event.",2
"I keep coming back because I love the concept of the place and my own nostalgia, but I feel like weeping every time I go because it has LOST A LOT OF THE MAGIC that it used to have. If you want to do something to feel that special Disney experience, you have to pay for it and fork over some serious money for the privilege.It has become SO PURELY commercialized. Charging a fortune for everything and crammed into the churning meat grinder. The quality of the merchandise is less than mediocre and most of it is made in China. The real Disney spirit of child like joy and wonder is a paper thin covering over a pit of greed.",2
"how can they charge so much money to get in with how crowded it is everyday, you cant enjoy anything. if you go during and shows or events youre herded like cattle. even besides how annoying it is to be shoulder to shoulder with everyone all day, that cant be safe... my wife and i got a premium pass this past year so we got to see first hand all year round and as great as disney is, i will never get a pass again. let alone pay over a $100 to go for a day. i hope someday they find a way to bring the magic back to disneyland and not make it about how much they can charge and how many people they can unsafely pack into the park.",2
"For years my family enjoyed a lunch or dinner at the Blue Bayou at Disneyland, now it has priced itself out of my range. I just paid $170 for a lunch for four with no drinks, just water and tea. I ate at Club 33 last year and dinner for 4 with drinks was only slightly more. And these were the low price items on the menu, no desserts and no extra items.",2
"We travel to Disneyland annually and more if we can find the time and of course the money. We scheduled our trip this year for the last week in August as usual. We are totally aware of the crowds, lines, heat, etc. However, this year I was completely disappointed disgusted with amount of rides that were broken down repeatedly. We purchased 6 four day park hoppers. ($1710.00 after the last two price increases, WOW!) Anyway, we arrived on a Friday and immediately went to DCA to attempt to get a fast pass for Radiator Springs as we approached the dispensing station we noticed that they were issuing FP for 6:30 7:30 with in a moment the sign was changed to    The FP distribution had commenced for the day   . So we went over to the ride to get in line but it was broke down and they were turning people away. We then walked around to Hollywoodland to get on the Monster   s Inc. ride because it is my youngest   s favorite   .closed, Grizzly River Run   .closed, Goofy   s Sky School   closed. This went on all day. Saturday we chose to spend the day at DL same issues there. Indiana Jones, Splash Mountain, etc. So on Sunday we hoped for a better day we went and had a very nice breakfast at the Story Teller Caf   and then headed back to DCA to try to hit our favorite rides again only to encounter the same. On this day we had stood in line for Grizzly River Run only to have it break down while in line. After 3 days of this we went and complained. This got us absolutely nowhere. You would think that when people spend this amount of money to take their family to Disneyland they would try to make things right by offering a free meal, extra fast passes or something. Nothing, Nada!! Since my children are getting older and have been numerous times, I believe this was our last family trip to Disneyland. It literally is cheaper after airfare, meals, hotel, and park entrance to go to Hawaii   .sad but true!",2
"My husband, my 9 year old, and myself were at Disneyland Aug 25 28 with a 3 day park hopper ticket. The first day, we spent most of our time at California Adventure, which had 4 decent  big kid  rides (Cars, Tower of Terror, Grizzly River, and California Screamin'). The second day we planned to spend at Disneyland. We knew Big Thunder Mtn Railroad was closed all summer for repairs, which were kindly noted on their website and app. However, we showed up at the Matterhorn that morning to find out it was down for the week for scheduled maintenance, yet no mention on the website app. It was, however, open the day before, which just annoyed us that we weredon't informed or else we would've gone the day before. Then we went to Space Mtn, which broke down while we were in line. We were given a  front of the line  pass for any other ride, which was a formal printed ticket that said  any ride but Matterhorn , which just confirmed they had planned to shut Matterhorn down that week but diddon't give ticketholders a courtesy notice. While waiting for the special ticket, another woman was telling us they had gone to Pirates and Indiana Jones first thing that morning and both those rides were broken down, too. Later that day, we got to experience that first hand, as Indy Jones broke down while we were waiting in line, but we were not offered a front of the line pass as a result. Luckily Splash Mtn was open, and Space Mtn was fixed later that day, but all in all, Disneyland was a total bust. They do not have enough  big kid  rides to have 2 of the 5 down for maintenance at the same time. As well, this is the last week of August, of summer, of tons of tourists traveling to LA for vacation before school starts   why dodon't you schedule maintenance the next week, when everyone's back at school and summer is over? Oh yeah, and we stayed to watch World of Color one night, and that broke down, too, about 5 minutes into the show. They got it going again after about 10 minutes, but by then we were over it and wanted to just go back to the hotel.We were very disappointed and had a hard time finding enough rides to entertain our family for 3 days. You know something's wrong when your 9 year old is begging to leave Disneyland because there isdon't enough to do.We wodon't be back to Disneyland. For future travellers, check the website for scheduled maintenance, if they bother to list it.Bring a water bottle, there are fountains everywhere.Go in the morning, and leave around 2pm, especially if you have a 3 day pass. Just go swimming at your hotel and rest, because you're not missing anything at the park other than long lines. Perhaps go back after 6:30 to catch some of the late night entertainment and cooler weather.And I would say that Disneyland is most ideal for 5 8 year old kids. Younger or older than that, and you'll be struggling.",2
"We visited Disneyland during the August school holidays, and were overwhelmed with the amount of people also there. It was soooo busy that it took my 18yr old daughter and I 3 hours to queue for only 2 rides. Needless to say we diddon't bother with any other rides. Save yourself the trouble and just go to Six Flags Magic Mountain at Santa Clarita, not that much of a drive from LA. Total waste of $97. ",2
Let me start out by saying we love Disneyland and were there on 8 29 13 for over 12 hrs. The issue isdon't on the inside of the park but on the outside. When you arrive you have to get in a line before the ticket line and have your bags checked. I have no issue with that but there should be line for people that have no bags to have checked. We waited for 25 minutes for cast members to check bags and fanny packs and strollers. I got lucky and got in the line with a cast member that really takes there job SUPER serious. She looked in every zipper and was so slow people began talking crap in the line. Who wants to stand in line that isdon't followed with a ride. My husband is Special Forces Officer and he said this is pure nuts that we have to go through this kind of a search for Disneyland. Oh it doesdon't end there! When we finally got done than you go stand in line for the entrance into Disneyland and they take your picture of each person in your party. I asked why are we having our picture taken and the cast member said if you lose your ticket we know it belongs to you and you can get back in. My husband who is an Officer said yeah right they take the picture so if anything goes down in the park they have a face! So we spend the day at the park and at night my husband decides to go back to hotel for an hour. On way out they stamped his hand and away he went. When he came back they said coulddon't come back in diddon't have his ticket. His hand was stamped and he said well in the morning you guys said if I lost my ticket you had a face to go with it so check that and let me in and why did you stamp my hand then on way out just an hour ago? Long story short he never got back in and my phone was on silent due to parade or I would have gone up to the gate and gave them his ticket. Instead he went back to hotel and called Disneyland to speak with someone in charge that said leave a complaint and we will get back to you. No one ever did! We live in AMERICA not a Third world Country and if his hand was stamped and if our pictures were taken in case of lost ticket why was he on the outside not being let back in. Come on Disneyland get your story straight! Cast members at gate need allot of work and putting the slowest people you can find at the check bags part a huge NO NO for guests paying 175 bucks for two days. These cast members are people's first experience into the park and there day. Someone please tell me why are picture was truly taken since the lost ticket story was a huge lie!Julie LopezSacramento CAJulie LopezSacramento CA,2
"I was disappointed during my recent visit to Disneyland. This is all Disney's fault. After all, they are the ones who set my expectations so high in the first place. Disneyworld is amazing. Disneyland has decent rides, and absolutely terrible customer service.First, the parks. If you have been to Disneyworld, then Disneyland will feel like a letdown in comparison. It is in the middle of a city, so you dodon't get the same experience of being transported to another world as you do with Disneyworld. Everything is smaller, especially the castle. It also feels much more crowded than Disneyworld. California Adventure is neat and has some things you cannot find at Disneyworld.The staff at Disneyland is not nearly as courteous or polite as the staff at Disneyworld. There were two particularly glaring examples of this. I was travelling with my disabled daughter and there were several rides at Disneyland where no attempt was made to provide a reasonable accomodation per ADA guidelines. In all cases, there was nothing about the ride itself or the line structure, etc. that prevented Disney from making an accomodation in our case. They simply chose not to do so. This is not the case at Disneyworld. Disneyland also does not advertise the fact that they fail to comply with ADA requirements, so guests with disabilities who are used to having reasonable accomodations at other parks get no warning that a good percentage of the rides will be unavailable to them until after they have paid their non refundable money for tickets.The ride operators were not polite about the failure to provide accomodations. One man literally screamed at a woman in line in front of me and told her that she should go somewhere else if she diddon't like how they had set things up. She and her daughter walked away in tears as a result. Other operators were repeatedly confused and provided conflicting information on where to go when using a guest assistance pass, etc.We stayed to watch the fireworks one night. There were repeated warnings that the park lights would be turned off and we should not move during the fireworks show, so my family and I picked out a spot along the railing to the side of a walkway. Five minutes after the show started, a Disney employee started shining her flashlight in my face and loudly told us that we needed to go somewhere else because we were blocking the walkway. Keep in mind that the walkway was about 20 30 feet wide at this point, and we were taking up at most 2 feet of this as we stood touching the side railing. I politely told the employee that I did not feel safe trying to move with my 3 small children in the darkness. She responded by threatening to call security and have me kicked out of the park! During this exchange, my oldest daughter got confused and started to follow the Disney employees instructions by walking off into the dark night into a crowd of people. It took us 5 10 minutes to find her and the Disney employee refused to let me use her flashlight or provide any other help in locating the child that she had caused to get lost.These experiences unfortunately marred what should have been a very enjoyable experience at Disneyland.",2
"Park was clean well organized. Wasted my time trying in Guest Relations and supervisors to honor my full price park hopper Florida tickets. Even made me go back twice to Guest Relations  to see what they could do , per supervisor; only to be told  sorry dodon't know why they told you to come back , the day we were going I wasted a day and was forced to leave because of what they did. Total humiliation and embarrassment. Had to pay $274 more for two tickets and two they honored. Ridiculous bc honored tickets were from 1992 and the other tickets were from 2011.So I can use the tickets in Florida even though the tickets were paid for and valid. Very unhappy and humiliated. I did go back a few days later and used money that was budgeted for something else. Disney doesdon't care. The only good thing was a staff member named Vanessa who was an Disney employee in Downtown Disney who on our first visit tried to help and make my friends baby granddaughter's first visit special. Vanessa was outstanding, sprinkling the baby with Pixie dust and gave her a Mickey and Minnie picture. Then we had to leave. I paid for 2 more tickets $274 when I already had valid unused tickets. Disneyland diddon't care.",2
"We took our 2 boys on an annual trip to something Disney because we are vacation club members. We usually visit Disney World in Florida and always enjoy our stay. The hotel was absolutely everything we had come to expect of Disney. We walked through the park on the first day and were greeted with a smile from a girl who wanted us to take a survey when our trip was complete. It was the last smile we saw! The staff managed to ruin everything from extra magic hours to meals at the hotel. They made everyone stand in long lines to check bags, even if you diddon't have one! Asked for room keys and ID's after entering the park. Not once, but 3 times! By the back of the park! Everyone just going through the motions. I dodon't believe I will be returning anytime soon.While flying home, I reminded my wife of the one friendly greeting we received and could not wait to take the survey. Just to let them know how unhappy my 4 days were. Even that was a mess! This was not the Disneyland I remembered. Universal Studio was an excellent day!",2
"If you hate crowds, crying children and long lines, then run (dodon't walk) far, far away. Disney World in Florida is significantly better managed. Guests in wheelchairs waited longer than guests standing in long, long lines! The weather was pleasant, but the staff was not. Our first mistake was to Fast Pass a ride in Tomorrowland. Although it was 9:15, the Fast Pass was for 3:30 and that eliminated using Fast Pass for the rest of the day (the return sign was wrong when it said 10:30). There are so many other great parks in southern California, do yourself a favor and skip Disneyland. Your children and spouse will thank you in the end!",2
"I attend a conference every other year in Long Beach and bring the family to enjoy a holiday with me. We go to Disneyland every time. Likely wodon't be going for awhile. Besides the ridiculous price of $131 U.S. for a one day flex pass to get into both parks, the place is showing its wear. The park staff have no sense of humour or interest. It's a  let's get it done but I have better things to do  attitude, lack of enthusiasm or interest and  if I dodon't look at you, you cadon't see me  experience we had everywhere we went throughout either park. Simple questions like  where is the Fastpass station for the Colour of Wonder show  met with avoidance on three occasions. The breakdowns of the rides became a running joke. California Screaming, Haunted House, Toontown ride, Indiana Jones, Log ride, Buzz lightyear and the Grizzley River Ride were all closed on the same day! What did I pay $700 CA$ for the five of us for? To stand in endless lineups everywhere we went and not get onto the ride? The kicker was when each of the rides would be closed down and we had already wasted half an hour in the line up. No refunds for this, Disney? How about I start charging you for my time wasted?Happiest place on earth? Only if you are drunk, I assume. There should be a law on how much Disney should be allowed to charge for water, too. At $3 a 355ml bottle on a day that is well over 30 degrees is absolutely robbery. We brought 10 small bottles (2 for each of us) that was gone by 10:00 am. We then went through about $100 just in water for the rest of the day. Seeing how dirty the water fountains are kept us to the bottled variety. Perhaps another Disney strategy. Bathroom facilities dirty and tons of toilet paper on the floor. Try sending someone in there periodically to wipe off the counter top and restock the papertowel. Bang for your buck? Maybe a once in a lifetime over more days, but definitely not for one day! LegoLand is starting to look a better attraction.",2
"Visited July 2013 with my 25 year old daughter, and two grand daughters. 5 and 2. For a 2 day park hopper was $206 each. The 2 year old was free, To charge that much for 2 days and then have to wait in lines to do anything for hours is not good. To top it off anything you buiy there is so over priced. $10 for a beer, Water $5, anything to eat at one of the cafes was appox. $15 per plate. They charge you $18 for a stroller rental, WOW, you would think that since the tickets cost so m,uch and you reallty dodon't go on many rides because the wait is just to long that they would give the strollers a much cheaper rental. Was not impressed with anything there, the kids like it but for the parents its almost unaffordable. We visited Knotts Berry Farm one day and it was on $66 per son, 2 year old free however the things for the kids to do was way better and the line wait for maybe 15 minutes, If you think about it by the time you pay to get to get there, the hotel charge, food and getting into the parks cost more than if we booked a vacation in a resort somewhere like Mexico just about anywhere else. Never would I do that again",2
"Disneyland is supposed to be magical. It wasdon't. It was hot and everything was very expensive. The rides were horrible. I diddon't get to ride anything. When it comes down to everything, go once. Everyone should go once in their lives. Dodon't go back though.",2
"Disneyland should limit the amount of people they admit each day. It cost roughly $400 for a family of 4 to go there and some of the lines are 1.5 hours long. This is crazy. I know everyone wants to take their kids there but do yourself a favour, go elsewhere",2
"I cannot believe how much money we paid for tickets and what we were able to do in the park due to the crowds.....unbelievable! We visited the park in the early 80's when our children were young and wanted our grandchildren to experience it now. Not even close to the fun we had back then. Long, long lines for everything! And the cost for food, merchandise and even a bottle of water was ridiculous! The park is still really clean and it has lots to see and do but you are very limited to what you'll experience due to the huge amount of people wanting to experience the same thing. If you have the luxury to go during the winter on a weekday, I think you'll have better luck getting your moneys worth than we did.",2
"We got there early in the morning at 9 am and we left at 12 am at midnight. It was really crowded like judgement day. I did not like the fact to stand up for hours to watch a parade or a show. I think Disney management should consider controlling park entry and population by not allowing park population to exceed certain number on a given day, through paid reservations. Food was extremely expensive and not too many choices. I enjoyed Disney World better last time I was there 4 years back. I wont advice, but good luck.",2
"After spending over 4K to visit Disneyland, we are so disappointed we went. Numerous rides broken down and  or closed while on the ride, waiting for the ride, or in line for ride. Shuttles were too full to board and never on time, Ariel's Grotto was a hurry up and eat, blink and you miss seeing the princesses ($200 for our family of 5 to eat there). Very impersonal. Parade float broke down before Mickey's parade so it was 30 min late. During that same parade ANOTHER parade float broke down. After listening to Princess Tiana sing the same two songs four times, our daughters asked to leave the parade.Super shuttle went to wrong hotel to pick us up to take us to airport. Almost missed our plane ride home.Very disappointed. Will not go back.",2
"We did not go to Disneyland because the price are too high. A two day   two park pass for 2 adults the price is $400.00, the last time we were down in Anaheim the prices were much cheaper around $190.00 for two adults for a two day two park pass. But we went to downtownDisney it was free admission except that you had to go through security and have your bagschecked which I felt was not necessary.",2
"I go to Disneyland on average once a year & this was probably my worst experience. Many of the cast members I talked to were friendly, & the crowds (extremely large for a Monday, probably due to the first day of summer for a lot of people yesterday) are something I cadon't control, but my biggest complaint was the rides.If I'm going to pay $90  for a ticket now, can you at least make sure the rides have regularly scheduled maintenance instead of compromising guest safety & happiness by only fixing them when they break down in the middle of the day!! We waited 40min appx. for Indiana Jones for instance then had to wait another 15min because the ride broke down. This was the story for at least half the rides we tried to go on they did honor our fast passes (as they should've).On top of that, I understand that Disneyland by default is expensive for food & souveneirs, but when you're charging $7.00  for ONE slice of pizza that is ridiculous!Overall very frustrating this time around, but hey, as long as thousands of people pour into the park every day, Disneyland will continue to employ these outrageous business tactics.",2
"I find this review very hard to write. I am 50 years old and have, my entire life, visited Disneyland a minimum of twice a year. Growing up we weredon't very wealthy but my father loved this place and what Walt Disney stood for SO MUCH that he brought us to the park all the time. It has been such a magical place for me and ultimately for my children (now aged 21   26). We have been pass holders before passes were so affordable and easy to acquire. I know that  once upon a time  Disneyland diddon't have competition, but now people have so many attractions to choose from that Disneyland may no longer be first choice.In the past year, I have noticed a great change in Disneyland. The first thing is how busy it is on almost any day of the year. Due to the annual passes, many can come everyday if they choose to. I have been at the park during a school week and the park is filled with Mom's and their toddlers. They use the park as a place to entertain their kids and then around 3:30 all heck breaks lose when parents of tweens and teenagers drop their kids off at the main entrance and drive off to have a peaceful evening. Translation for the adult Disneyland enthusiast is a crowded park with long lines 90% of the time. It has become impossible to ride a substantial amount of rides in one day. We have averaged 5 6 rides PERIOD.I feel that this enslaught of unattended teenagers has caused the  cast members  of Disneyland to also lose their cool. With each subsequent visit I find more and more not friendly cast members (Disneyland employees are referred to as Cast Members, not employees). Our last visit was my breaking point, when we were accosted by a front gate cast member and then her Lead Cast Member (supervisor) was just as nasty as her. Very unprofessional behavior for any park, absolutely unheard of from Disneyland, or is it? When a supervisor supports the nasty behavior from their employee I then know that this issue goes straight to the top. There is a managing employee that has told them whether directly or indirectly that this behavior is allowable. VERY unacceptable for my family and I. At this point my husband was demanding I have his annual pass cancelled and my 21year old son wanted to do the same with his own pass. This is how bad the situation was.The last major complaint I have is their food quality and service. I used to be excited that I would get to graze all day in the park. This is no longer the case. The food is horrific, badly made, badly kept fresh and absolutely horrible temperatures. I find that the food in not only tasteless but I am sure can be dangerous to our health. I know you are asking where are the health inspectors, think about this. A health inspector will have to come in through a secured entrance where they will announce their intent. A quick radio call to lead supervisors gets the park on alert immediately and things are put in place prior to the inspector having a chance to come to one of the food vendors. This last trip we ate at the Taste Pilot's Grill, which is located in the California Adventure Park near the Soaring over California ride. You can read my review of that restaurant next. : ) Let's keep it short the food was horrendous. Cold cheaply made and they charged an arm and a leg. The service was nothing to get excited about either. No wonder we found seats in the patio area, people already knew to avoid this place.So what to do? Disney will eventually realize that the peoplel who actually spend money at Disneyland are no longer visiting, or when we do visit we keep it short and sweet. We do our shopping and eating away from the park. I know that my family of 10 (whose passes I pay for) will not be rushing to visit anytime soon. I am really hoping that Disneyland comes to it's senses and realizes just because the park is busting at the seams everyday may not be the wisest business decision when it comes to money. And that if they do not pick up their employee training and create happy cast members again, that the customers coming to the park will also start behaving in an angry nasty manner. I know we left for the first time ever before closing because of our experience with the nasty gate agent. We left because we could no longer be nice, the agent set our tone for us.I really hope changes are affected, I miss the enchancted kingdom as it once was.",2
"Buyer beware   if you go on a grad night, you're making a HUGE mistake. I still have a complaint letter I need to write to Disney's Guest Relations...",2
"We spent over $600 on 2 days (Tues and Wed in May) at Disneyland with our 2 twin 5 year olds. Yes, the place was clean and the employees are incredible and all would be great with 80% less people. The lines are ridiculous, the Fast Pass process at CarsLand is useless, and when we did the Fast Pass for the Tower, we still were in line to wait for 45 minutes so we just left. I cadon't believe people spend so much time at this park and wait in the lines. what's the point? Good parts were Space Mountain (Fast Pass worked there, we went early) and the lake pavilion area at Adventure Park. not as crowded. Goofy's Diner was great   expensive but an easy way to see the characters without the crowds.",2
"We visited the park the day after Memorial day figuring that the holiday weekend was over and the lines would not be unreasonable. Boy, were we wrong! The local schools apparently get both the holiday and the day after off and the park was absolutely packed with local kids! There were hour  long waits for everything there! If you are going to be there anytime around a holiday, you may want to call ahead to get a local's perspective on what to expect.",2
"May 28 my lil guy turn 4 years old so we decide to take him to the happiest place on earth. but, my son fault so out of place.he wasnt able to ride most of the ride in the park because he 39  and half tall. and u need to be 40  so i was like maybe toon town u would enjoy but, it was closed for hours do to one of disneyland worker putting a dry ice boom in the trash can. how crazy is that! So i called Disneyland to let them know we had a terrible time all the said, was  sorry  and took down my phone  ,first,last, and address. The guy didnt even care i spend over $500 on just getting into the park, snacks and drinks. NEVER AGAIN!!",2
"Definitely NOT the happiest place around, in fact, complete rip off! World of Color  do NOT get ripped off buying the crazy $16 valueless snack pack so you can get tickets to 'front of line', NOT! Front of line means you should get there at least 2 hours before the show and line up and hope you get close to the front. If you want to wait 2 hours, there are lots of free spots without having to spend $16 for $3 worth of COLD food!In Bug land, and when the temperature was around 85F, my kids was trying to have fun in the 'jumping fountains' where they can run through splashing water and was shocked when a staff member told them they MUST be fully clothed with shoes and socks!! Most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in my entire life.I am not sure why they advertise themselves as the happiest place on earth? We seldom saw smiling faces...grumpy faces outnumber happy ones 10:1? check it out for yourself!we went the week of May 20 and line ups were mostly 30 45 minutes. I know Disney can do many thing to speed up the lines but why would they? They have collected your $$$ and why would they care? many rides were shut down throughout the day with no reason given. ",2
"This Disney park caters predominately to locals with several attractions and shows only operating on the weekends or during holidays (including fireworks). Staying on property does include an early hour in the park but many of the attractions do not open early. There were artificially long lines because of low staff numbers. For example at It's a Small World only one of two loading areas were open because they only had enough cast members to operate the one. Cast members in general seemed very unhappy. Unlike Walt Disney World, this is not a multi generational park   with most guests being teenagers going to the park after school.",2
"If you have kids, this place is perfect.I've been to disney in Florida, which was great, obviously a lot bigger but I thought I'd give this place a go while visiting LA. 2 of the main rides, were closed. Which we weredon't told till we had walked up to them. Which left 3 main rides (which weredon't great). The queues were enormous and there was only fast pass for 5 of them. Which was unless when the 2 main ones we wanted to go on weredon't open. We did the park in 3.5 hours. I was hoping to spend at least 6 hours there. There was that little to do. We went after Easter. Place was packed. Hard to imagine how bad it'd be in peak season. Kids would love it, but 16  I would say, give it a miss and go to their adventure park or universal. Universal was Outstanding. We diddon't make it to Anaheim's adventure park, but it coulddon't have been any worse than this one  (for our age group). I'm 27 and my partner is 35.Very overpriced for what you get. Virtually every ride you could put a 5 year old on. We looked massively out of place without kids in toe. Florida one is much better.The ART bus service to Anaheim station is also pretty rubbish. 45 min wait and then they diddon't show up. The Anaheim LA Amtrak train is also a bit a of a nightmare. Our return train was delayed and the operator told us it could be there in 10 min or 5 hours. They diddon't know when it would appear, so we had no choice but to pay $80 for a taxi back to LA. So I would suggest hiring a car if you go to Anaheim, public transport round that way is rubbish! Wish we diddon't go!",2
"We came here with our 4 year old son, so it should be said he had fun   for about 3.5 hours. That's about $23 hour. The last time we saw Disneyland was in 1984 and there has been little done to improve it   the rides are the same, the place could use bright paint and new walkways. To be honest, it was deflating to see it had not changed, except that it was overcrowded.We came on the Friday (there by 9 am). The parking and entry is well organized to get people in. Once you are there, the lines are minimum 25 minutes (even with Fastpass)   and with little kids, that gets very tiring. We happened to catch Goofy early on and waited 5 minutes, but all other characters were minimum 30 minutes by 10:30 am. Not our cup of tea!It is nice that they let you take strollers, food and drink   otherwise this would have been an even more expensive venture. (Take your valuables with you when you get on a ride, and leave your stroller...)For us, Disneyland was enough for a one time visit, but never again.",2
"Unfortunately Disneyland is past it's glory days, tickets are overpriced compared to other parks, even mid week queues are long, a couple of rides were 45 mins, Wasdon't happy to have 5 rides out of action including 2 of 3 roller coastersBoth other times I've visited the park was clean and shinny, today it was dirty & tiredMy biggest whinge is that park hasdon't changed & updated it rides, not much has changed in 20 yearsI visited 4 other theme parks with my Family over last couple of weeks & I saved Disneyland for last but very disappointed & come dead last compared to other parks we went toKnotts Berry & 6 Flags had a lot more as rides for half the price plus the rides were much better Seaworld & Universal are much cleaner, a little cheaper, have way shorter queues & they have newer attractions Wodon't be back!",2
"Long queues, outdated rides and expensive food sums up the day. It really needs a full makeover and new rides to lift it back to it's famous standard. If you are looking for good theme parks there are far better ones out there.",2
"I expected Disneyland to be crowded because it was Easter week and many students are out of school but I have never seen it like this before. We went on Tuesday, thinking it woulddon't be as bad as going on the weekend. I was disappointed in the FastPass system. You get a ticket at an attraction which tells you when you can come back and get right on so you dodon't have to stand in long rides. Without this ticket you can be in line for 2 hours. So as not to have people running around collecting all the Fast Pass tickets at all the attractions at once there is a time written on the ticket when you can get a ticket to a second attraction. We got our first ticket at 11am for a 3 4pm ride and could get our next FastPass at 1:30pm. The problem was there were NO passes left in the park by that time! Our other big disappointment came while waiting to get on Space Mountain. Without a FastPass we were going to be waiting 90 minutes (there is a clock outside the ride so you know what you're in for!) but after over an hour of waiting we were told that the ride was being shut down and they coulddon't say when it would be back up and running. This was so disappointing and we had no desire to go stand in any other line as everything we saw was posted as a 90 minute wait. Groan...We had planned on staying until closing but left around 7pm to look for a restaurant outside of the park grounds. ",2
"After this last visit I wonder if it's really worth $125 day to... 1) wait for hours on end to enjoy a 45 second ride2) spend time in the queue for everything from going to the washroom to grabbing a 'meal' to paying for your souvenirs. You gotta line up and wait for EVERYTHING. 3) Overpriced   from the funnel cakes, drinks and the ice cream bars to the poorly prepared and pathetically presented 'meals' in dangerously over crowded restaurants to the key chains mugs t shirts stuffed plushies (which by the way you could pick up at the ABC store less than a block from the maingate for mere pennies   same stuff), it's all over priced. 4)Crowded crowded crowded   cadon't find a seat in the 'restaurants', cadon't find a spot to watch the parades, cadon't find a spot to sit and watch the water show(even after being directed to a specific spot by an employee   only to be told later by another employee that we coulddon't sit there   we were then directed to sit behind this bush over here that's partially blocked by that garbage can which of course is hidden behind that fence which is then blocked by 10,000 people)   we ended up just hopping into the queue to get out of this place and watched an ad for the watershow on our hotel Disney channel. So...in a nutshell, not the best experience. Went with some older family members this time and were completely disappointed and frustrated. No character's running about like before. The parades had less floats than before. The addition of the watershow only turned into a huge disappointment. Thankfully when we were there last time with young family members, we got to see Mickey, Minnie, Goofy(even though the niece was terrified of him), Max, princesses...the parade was totally worth the wait then. I'm just glad that this time it was only adults who were able to live with the disappointments.A word of advice to those families out there who are planning a trip to LA to do the Disney thing. Come in February or November. Take your kids out of school and avoid the peak season. Cheaper to fly to LA, cheaper for hotels, no ridiculous lines queues crowds. It may be worth the outrageous prices if there aredon't those things to worry about.After all was said and done, we were joking that for an extra 10$ a night we could have got a parkside room and watched the fireworks nightly from the room and saved on the park fee, especially since the best view of the new watershow was looping on the hotel's Disney channel endlessly day in day out. So, paying $125 for a day of waiting...waiting...waiting...and waiting, only be just so frustrated that we left the park early. Is it worth it???",2
"Like SeaWorld in San Diego, Disneyland and California Adventure have a  no food  policy. That is to say, you're not allowed to bring in any food or drinks. This is ostensibly  because there aredon't enough picnic tables to accommodate people who bring food, and people who buy food inside the park . I happen to know a former SeaWold executive who told me what everyone knows to be the real reason: they dodon't allow you to bring in food, because they want you to buy theirs. To understand this, you need to know that at these places, it's less to do with  magic  and all about the trickery of making vast amounts of cash. At SeaWorld their objective is to extract $100 a day per adult, in parking, food, drinks and merchandise ($60 per child)   this is after paying an already exorbitant entrance fee. Markup on what they sell across the board isdon't the typical retail 50%, but (brace yourself) upwards of 1,600%. I coulddon't believe it either, but when you consider that a hot dog costs less than 25 cents to produce, and the fact that they sell them for $8, then this figure is accurate. The crowding is all part of their marketing plan too. Although they could limit numbers into the park to avoid the horrendous waits, they dodon't   and there's a reason for this: if you're swiftly able to go from amusement to amusement, you're less likely to stop and buy anything.    For their part, it's smart marketing. Caveat emptor.    So how do you save money at Disneyland and California Adventure? Here's how: dodon't eat there! Bring in as much food and drink you think you'll require and if they hassle you at the gate when they search your bag, tell them you require a special diet because you have  type 2 diabetes . The dimwit checking your bag probably wodon't even know what diabetes is; all you need to tell him her is that in the U.S., diabetes is considered a disability and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973   states that no person entering a  public accommodation  can be subjected to any form of discrimination. Legally, public amusement parks are defined as a public accommodation.     But I'm not diabetic?    So what? They're using deceit to fleece you, why cadon't you do the same to save yourself a lot of money? Two meals at SeaWorld for a family of four will set you back more than $100. The equivalent from any supermarket will cost you no more than $30.   By the way, regarding your having diabetes; you have to prove nothing. Just like they cadon't ask a wheelchair bound person why they require a wheelchair, they have no right to ask you to prove that you have diabetes. If you want a coup de grace, get yourself an inexpensive arthritis bracelet.",2
"We love Disneyland and make frequent visits from our home in Colorado. For us, Disneyland is magic. We mistakenly thought April was past spring break time. It was wall to wall gridlock and a miserable experience. All you could do was to concentrate on trying to find a way to make your path and the magic that should be Disneyland was totally lost. Do not even bother to go when it's this crowded, it's just a really unpleasant experience.",2
"Huge mistake! I thought the crowds during the summer were bad. They make the park seem empty compared to going during spring break. A 3 hour wait for the new Cars ride and fastpasses were all out by 10:15? No thanks. 2 hour wait for Space Mountain? Just trying to walk around was diffiult. Next time, we are going to take our kids out of school. At least the kids had fun.",2
"We arrived at 5pm in the hope that it would be less crowded in the evening, but were we wrong! The place was extremely crowded, even on a non holiday weekday. 40 50 minute waits were standard. So we only managed 3 rides, but the Space Mountain ride was a thrill! Overall, a waste of money. The best thing was the fireworks! Very expensive and so commercial. Beware of the strollers!! They are everywhere!!!!!",2
"due to traffic, we didnt arrive until 4 but still had to pay the full price ($87 PER person). The place was a zoo, even on a non holiday weekday. 30 40 minute waits were standard.Your entertainment dollars are better spent elsewhere. If you have kids obsessed with princesses, get there early and get it done in a day",2
"I'm probably going to get shot down here, but I found the original Disneyland Resort to be dated, and worn out, with many of the rides in exactly the same condition that they were during my last visit in the 90's. the rides all utlise old technology, and the Animatronics are so 70's! The downtown Disney area was an interesting side attraction, with plenty of shopping opportunities. While it still offers a fun day out, it is probably better suited to people who enjoy the older style attractions, and reminiscing about old times.",2
"My overall experience would have been a great one if it haddon't been for the new ticket entrance process at Disneyland. Each line has two customer reps   one takes a picture of you and the other checks for the validate date. While my family was waiting in line for a magic morning, the person in front of us had mistakenly taken another family member's ticket and the line was held up. After 10 minutes, I asked if my family could get through at the next line but the rep said she already verified our pictures so we had to stay in the current line. Another 5 minutes passed and the people behind us also started complaining and walking to other lines so my family followed. Once I got into the park, I went to guest services and complained that half of our magic morning was ruined with this poorly executed process and bad customer services. Oh, did I mention that the device that Disney uses for picture validation is slow and it takes about twice the time to get into a park? Also, it is not fun at all if you have a park hopper ticket and have to go through the same ticket validation with each re entrance.",2
"My husband and I went on a Sunday and there were sooooo many people with such long lines for everything. It was difficult to walk through the crowds and we really diddon't have any space because there was always someone right next to us throughout the entire 8 hours we spent there! The pizza we ate ($8.00 1 slice!) near Space Mountain was horrible; do not go there unless you enjoy wasting your money! Small World wasdon't open and the Monorail was having  technical difficulties  after we stood in line & wasted 45 minutes of our time. Lastly, we really felt that the park was  outdated  and not as clean as in years past. We felt that Disney needs to spend some of the millions that they earn each year in beautifying the park upgrade the rides. Comparing Disneyland to CA Adventure Park is a no brainer, go to CA Adventure Park instead.",2
"For the ridiculous prices Disney is now charging their people should be polite   like in the recent past, their food should at least be tasty if it cadon't be a bit less expensive",2
Have been coming here for over 25 years. Same sad attractions and over priced food and souvenirs. Its a retail store with rides and over priced everything. Why change or improve anything when the entire world is brain washed into thinking this is the happiest place on earth?,2
"The trip to Disney is supposedly one of the great experiences for families, couples, or people of any age. However, when you witness the lineups at 9.30 in the morning on a weekday in January, then you become aware of the potency of the Disney marketing machine. The Disney scenes are very impressive, and the Cars ride has a fantastic backdrop, but I am not sure any of the rides are worth spending so much time waiting in line for. if you dodon't line up for the fastpass as soon as you get in, then you might well miss the ride unless you can handle long line ups of 2 hours  for a 4 minute ride. One can only imagine how bad it is in summer or on weekends, when almost all the rides will be affected.In reality, it is fine for small kids, but once over 10 years old, the attractions are limited and there are many parks that have more and are significantly cheaper. The attraction of Disney is incredible as you can see large crowds on all days, and horrendous numbers on weekends. Food is expensive, as are drinks and snacks. With two parks, Disney has managed to increase revenues substantially, even charging you an extra $30 if you want to go from one to the other, something that appeals as you can easily get through one in a few hours (unless you spend most of that time in line ups). The older Disneyland park is looking tired, its attractions are dated, especially when compared to smaller parks, but other larger parks are now substantially more interesting with far better rides.It might be the happiest place on earth for Disney shareholders, but lots of people are paying a lot of money for participating in one of the great marketing exercises of all time.",2
"We travelled specifically to Anaheim mid January with our children aged 9 and 10 years to visit Disneyland. This was after a 4 month trip to many world destinations. Disneyland was the biggest let down of our entire trip. I feel Disneyland has got greedy, charging exhorbitant prices for food and merchandise. OK, we diddon't have to buy anything   and we avoided it as much as we could. Actually bought Disney products at Target store and they were really cheap. But the biggest negative aspect of the visit was the endless queues and the long waits to get into the park in the morning. We went after the holiday season in LA when it was supposed to be quiet and still the wait time for all rides was at least 30 mins. Cars Land was 180 mins. The ride is amazing tho when you get on. Without the Fast Pass system we would have been hooped. Managed to do about 4 5 key rides a day using this. So if you go, be sure to master it early on. We bought a 3 day pass to get the Magic Morning early entry. That day it took 55 mins for the staff to process the queue so we could just get in the gate. Arrrrrggggghhhh, try explaining that to 2 really gutted kids. Their excuse was that they were trialling a new photo ID system to prevent fraud. Well I do not agree that I should have to pay over $1000 NZ dollars to be part of your trial and stand in a ridiculous queue. Bad brand experience Disney!!! I really feel for the price and the time standing in queues it was not good value at all. Why do they not limit the number of tickets sold each day? We did the Alcatraz tour in San Fran and this in on a limited ticket basis and you have to book weeks in advance. But it was fabulous and a great experience. Just felt Disneyland was all about the $$$ and not the experience. I hate to be negative, but I am being totally honest here about how disappointed we were. We will not be back and we are warning everyone here in NZ to think carefully about the huge expense to travel to LA and then have this kind of experience.",2
"I had a very unpleasant experience while I was visiting Disneyland Resort, Anaheim, on December 31, 2012, yes, it was New Year's Eve, and it was at around 11:30pm when I was trying to catch the New Year's countdown and fireworks at Disneyland (from 10:00pm ~ 11:20pm, I was in California Adventure Park to see the World of Color show). I would like to share my experience with you and hope there will be an improvement on Disneyland's procedure for multi day passes.I had a 5 day Park Hopper ticket and was re entering Disneyland park, I presented my ticket and my photo ID to the lady named Isabella (if I remember correctly), she was looking at my ticket and questioning me why the ink was not dark, I said I did not do anything to make the ink fade, in fact, I used the pen provided by Disneyland to write down my name on the ticket on the first day of my visit, after that, I just kept using my ticket, the ink was fading by itself, nothing I could do about it. She insisted on saying that the pen was the permanent mark, the ink should not fade at all. I said if the ink was fading, then the pen was really not a permanent mark. She asked me to step aside saying someone would check my ticket, I had no choice but to follow the order, however, I never expected I would wait for more than 10 ~ 15 minutes (it felt like forever) to get my ticket back. I was in a hurry to join the crowd for the countdown and fireworks, but the Disneyland lady and her lead seemed not caring about it at all.They took their time and did not even bother to care my concerns. I asked the lady when I could get my ticket back, and why it took so long to check the ticket, she simply answered  my lead had your ticket ...  with very arrogant, cold, and careless atitude, and no explanation on why it took so long. I said anxiously that I needed to catch the fireworks, but she DID NOT CARE AT ALL!!!All my family members got in with their tickets, but they had to wait for me, they really did not understand what was wrong with my ticket, my name was still there, just the ink was light, there was no sign on misusing of the ticket.Finally after a long time, her lead Robert came back and gave the ticket back to me, Isabella used a pen to put the new ink on my name. I asked Robert why it took so long to check my ticket, again he simply said  oh, I needed to validate your ticket ... . Okay, you could validate my ticket, but with the world class Disneyland park, it took more than 10 ~ 15 minutes to validate a ticket? and I was blocked at the door for almost 20 minutes in total from the beginning to the end. There were no apologies from Disneyland staff at all! I was so frustrated and upset.My whole family went to the City Hall and spoke to the management. We brought up our concerns seriously; while we were in the City Hall, we missed the countdown plus the beginning of the fireworks, we rushed to the outside and watched the fireworks from a not so good view point, my Dad missed the whole fireworks since he continued discussing our concerns with the manager.The incident totally ruined our New Year's Eve celebration at Disneyland which was the most important part of our visit, and I just do not understand why I should be punished while it was not my fault at all? If anything was wrong, it was the pen, the pen was provided by the Disneyland Park, I had nothing to do with it. Because of the poor  permanent mark , it wasted my and my family members' precious 20 minutes on New Year's Eve, plus the time to report our concerns.I visited Disneyland, LA, two times in 2011 with my 5 day and 6 day tickets, I enjoyed my visits and felt the Disneyland staff was so friendly and well trained. But the experience I had in 2012 destroyed my good impression on Disneyland completely. We already felt a lot of inconvenience of showing both the tickets and the ID's in 2012, and then on top of it, a lot of suspicions and distrust. I paid $300 for my ticket, and I did not think I should be treated like that way.I really feel a new solution should be come up to respond to this situation. I saw some other guests with the valid tickets were blocked at the entrance too; to me, that experience is the ultimate insult and humiliation. I always use valid tickets, and with the tickets I was never ever blocked at the door anywhere else except Disneyland. We were coming for the happiness, but not for the distrustfulness, the interesting thing was, after that lady rewrote my name on the ticket using the pen, a couple of days later, the ink faded again! I still have my ticket with the faded ink.Disneyland did not have a good procedure for the multi day tickets, the current procedure is not working!! the pen was not actually a permanent mark, therefore, Disneyland should take the consequence, but not me, not the guests!!!",2
"The park was fun, but with the overcrowding and long line ups I really think I paid way too much for a family of 6. Wodon't be back. There are a lot of other places that I will get good value for my entertainment dollar.J.R.",2
"At between $80   $112 per person for a one day pass, you would think that it must be good at the cost. In reality, we went on January 3rd which was still the US school holidays, and only managed to get on 2 basic rides during the whole day with the kids due to the queues. Its a lot smaller than Floridas Disneyworld   so large volumes of people make it unmanageable. The average fast pass availability was 4hrs later than the ticket issue   and we got there at 10am and spent an hour parking and getting in. Simply joining a line for a ride without a fastpass meant an average of 50   80 minutes, which was too much for kids under 7 to tolerate. We ended up just riding around on the park train and having a burger   which proved to be the most expensive fast food given that we could have went ot a Burger King outside and saved $500 for a family of four. It seems that many local residents have annual passes so just go for a day out at no extra cost, so it means foreign visitors pay a premium for a disappointing service. They should really consider applying a capacity limit so that you can have a reasonable chance of benefiting from what is an expensive day out with no guarantee of even getting on many rides. you could hardly even walk around, very disappointing.",2
"This is the visit that made me never want to come back to a Disney park! Sad. True, we were there over the holidays, but the crowding was really impossible. They should consider a system for limited entry on given dates or charge premiums. It is terrible to pay the high entry charges and then discover that all the rides you want to go on have 90  minute waits. To top it off, on one day we went to the new Cars Land in CA Adventure and the Radiator Springs ride broke down THREE times. We had fastpass 2x for this ride and the last time, we waited for 45 min to an hour in the fastpass line and were actually seated in the car of the ride when it broke down AGAIN and we were literally asked to get out of the car (they gave us another fastpass for late at night, which was useless to us).CA Adventure was more pleasant because less crowded, but Disneyland itself was very unpleasant  shoulder to shoulder people and foot traffic unable to move due to overcrowding & strollers. They had staff trying to direct people in crowded areas (e.g. entry to Indiana Jones narrow passage near Jungle cruise; near It's a small world, etc.). I was unable to ride my favorite rides due to long waits. The kids have been looking forward to this trip all year and were very disappointed. We spent a lot of time just walking between rides, waiting in lines for everything, and trying to move through the crowds, which is very tiring. My worst Disney experience yet! I will not go back for a long time...we felt cheated.",2
"We visited Disneyland Park on December 28 and while we were prepared to brave the crowds since it is the holiday season after all, we did not expect to see the park that packed. When you get into the parking lot, the cashier asked us if we already had tickets, which we had already purchased online. He let us in after paying the $15 fee and handed us a green ticket that stated that Disneyland Park was busy so they were not letting in people anymore. I guess that is Disney's way of lifting off their liabilities. We had the 2 day, one park per day package and were visiting LA with a 6 year old. So it is not like we had the luxury of coming back another day where it was less busy.We were still able to get in despite the extreme business. It was packed, so packed that you could barely see the grounds. I felt unsafe to get around and was holding my daughter's hands the whole time. We tried to get by during the parade so we could do some ride. Impossible.Average wait time was 50 minutes for each ride. We only managed to do 2 rides in between the parade in the 4 1 2 hours we were there. Food is awful and extremely expensive. $35 for the 2 worst hamburgers we ever had and a mini pizza which was more dough than pizza and 3 drinks, that is extreme. We also had to line up for that 20 minutes. And line up for the washrooms.It was a big disappointment for us and anything but magical. They take so much money yet make it impossible to experience more that 2 3 rides per visit. That is over $20 per ride, a rip off, if you ask me.I dodon't know if there is ever a slow time. Avoid if you can.",2
"They WAY over sell the park admission. Day after Christmas we expected it to be crowded, but not like this. EVERY single land was elbow to elbow crowded and we did three rides from 9am 7pm. It was horrible! Asked our 5 year old granddaughter if she liked Disneyland the next morning, she just lowered her eyes and shrugged her shoulders. Greed has replaced invention and fun in Disneyland! Walt would be very sad to see what it has come to.",2
"We spent 5 1 2 days at Disneyland and California Adventure in the first week of December. And thank goodness we had so long as the parks were VERY crowded. We tried to line up 30 minutes before the parade and we ended up somewhere we could only see the back of the floats :(The tickets were EXPENSIVE (A$1100 for 5 day park hoppers for our family of 2 adults and 2 children). If you want to wait less than an hour to see a character, you have to pay $100  for a character breakfast. If you want a seat for the Candlelighter's performance, that will be $50. I paid $6 for a hot dog that was a micro bun and a small sausage. I've had better food, and more reasonably priced, in airports :( If you want to actually see World of Color, buy a meal that includes a fast pass to a reserved area. It's add on, add on, add on. Which after shelling out $1100 to get in the gate, I thought was too much.The lines were horrendous. 45 minutes to get in the gate with our pre paid tickets on day 2 as they were checking photo ID of EVERYONE who had more than a one day ticket. So that was basically everyone. DREADFUL experience. Two hours   line up for the Radiator Springs racers. Over an hour for the Buzz Lightyear ride in California Adventure. And on and on and on and on the line list went. Not at all suited to small children who have zero waiting tolerance let alone when they are tired.Would I take our family back again? Afraid not. That was my fourth visit to Disneyland in California and I fear it will be my last. Which is a REAL shame.",2
This was probably the biggest disappointment of our trip. The place was so crowded you coulddon't even walk. We have been to Disney World three or four times and never had crowds and waits like this. We were there for 14 hours and were only able to ride six rides and see one show. The whole fast pass idea is a flop. The radiator springs fast passes were gone before 11 am. I think it's time Disney made some changes. We would have gladly paid the extra $400 for a real fast pass like Six Flags offers. I will say that the Christmas decor was magnificent. Could not see the parades due to the crowds. Even the line to the Haunted Mansion was bad. Too crowded and too expensive for what little we got to do. Wodon't return.,2
"I was disappointed. It started from the time we walked in. I want to start off by saying I love Disney, I have been many many times. This place does not carry the same value system as Disney in FL. I saw so many members of the Disney family, looking like it was there last day on earth. SAD. It was depressing. Time and time again I saw the workers look unhappy. The streets are small. We had someone with a wheel chair and it was almost impossible to get though. Disney does not have any lockers on the outside of one of the entrances. So we had to walk though to another gate, then walk out. Use a locker then wait inline again. I was not happy. The parade was awesome. So we did like that. It is magical at times. When you look at the castle when you walk in, Its nothing like the Castle in FL. Sorry Disney, i'm a fan, just not on this day.",2
"We were very disappointed in our trip to Disneyland. The overcrowding was criminal. We actually feared that our kids might be trampled upon exiting one ride. In a full day, we managed only 2 rides, so average $45 each! The lines for the 3 rides our kids most wanted to see Splash Mountain, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Space Mountain were 1 to 2 hours minimum (with 140 minutes posted for Splash Mountain when we left). Check out our photos to prove it. The wait for a cafeteria style lunch at non peak time was 45 minutes. There were not nearly enough bathrooms; we waited 20 minutes once. Even the wait to get into the parking lot was 45 minutes. The drinking fountains were the non chilled kind and many were stopped up. The only highlights were the Pirate's Lair, on an island reached by ferry so less crowded. it was described as a natural environment, meaning the same fun could be had for free at any state park playground. The Columbia ship ride and canoe adventure also were fun. The experience was so awful that we came up with a game called Pretend Silver Linings, so we could try to laugh at the fact that we'd paid $450 to get in. Like, at least with the line to get lunch so long, we have time to chat, or The experience is so bad that we can leave and go to the free Lego Imaginarium earlier. Unless you can visit on, say, a Wednesday in February, taking your kids out of school, skip it.",2
"Dodon't go during a busy time of year (like Christmas break). The people were packed in like sardines, the lines had over one hour waits, it was dirty, and four of the rides we waited for broke down before we got to ride them. The food was super expensive and wasdon't all that tasty.I diddon't see one character except while watching the parade.",2
"1st time in Disneyland on 20 Dec and it shall be my last! To be fair, the rides are fun, the place is beautiful. BUT it is way too CROWDED! If u dodon't mind waiting over an hour for a 2 min ride, then please ignore my review. There were so many people that it's impossible to feel any Disney magic at all. Wanted to see the fireworks or the World of Colors at California Adventure Park, but at the thought of the ocean of people thronging there, we gave up. My kids were so relieved when we finally left the park. Conclusion: Too expensive, too crowded, too long waits. Go at your own risk!",2
"I first went to Disneyland when I was 10   it cost $6 to get in   and I never had enough  E  Tickets. I've visited several dozen times. I went back this week   it was $87 or $125 including California Adventure and I ran out of feet. $15 for Parking. Granted, I was there on a holiday weekend, and you really dodon't want to go when the place is full   Summer and Holidays. Those prices are for a single day. There are discounts on 2 5 day visits. I diddon't discover  Fast Pass  until it was too late to be of much help. Fast Pass avoids some lines, but increases your walking. California Adventure    World of Color  show was good   an update of the  Fantasmic  technology   but mostly movies projected onto water spray without much of a plot like  Fantasmic  has.. On Indiana Jones & Jungle Cruise   the line threads through a  Preshow  that makes the time pass quickly.  Radiator Springs  has almost nothing to distract you along the way. 2 Hour Wait for a 10 minute ride.... Food Quality and Variety has improved dramatically   but nothing much below $10 for lunch or $25 for dinner. You look at hotels, park admission, and food   a family of 4 may need financing. Speaking of financing   You can buy an annual pass at around $500   and finance it.... Never thought I'd see a need to finance an amusement park.",2
"The park was completely overcrowded, the wait time for rides was ridiculous as was the wait time for food. This was not the happiest place on earth....it was hell on earth! But I dodon't think my opinion matters ( or anyone elses for that matter) Disney is racking in about $100 a ticket plus parking plus everything you buy...they are definately making bank off of us! ",2
"The park is clean and the weather is pleasant. The park was crowded for an off peak time. The lines for rides were not too bad, but the rides themselves are often disappointing.Sections of the park close early for the fireworks display. For some unknown reason the toon town section of the park doesdon't open until an hour after the rest of the park, and toon town is one of the areas that closes early for the fireworks. Several attractions were closed for maintenance.We barely saw any character actors. We had to stand in line for 30 to 40 minutes to see a character when they were available. We were ignored by one set of character actors we found wondering in the park. We waited in line on another character actor while she went on break with no one replacing the character for more than 20 minutes. We were assured every five minutes by rude staff member that the character would be right back. I think the staff member was trying to be entertaining, but he was rude and obnoxious. We eventually gave up waiting and left. Is there a rule that only one Mickey Mouse character actor can be present in the park at a time?We all expect the food to be expensive, but there are sit down restaurants in the park that are over $30.00 a plate. We opted to skip the Blue Bayou for for simple lunch with a couple of drinks for two adults and a child. Our meal was over $50.00. The food was cold, and my daughters chicken nuggets had four pieces ($9.00).The simple plastic mickey mouse ears are about $16.00 and additional charges to put a name on them. I have better things to do with my money and time. I will not be visiting a Disney attraction again.I would not recommend this experience unless you have a lot of time, money and patience. In my opinion Disney is no longer out to please the customer.",2
"Lines were too long and had trouble finding something to do other than just walk around and look at stuff. Crowds were infuriating and so bad that you literally could not stop moving. Not a place I would take our younger kids and infant to. DL needs to find a solution for strollers. Thought about going a second day once we scoped out rides we wanted to do (Haunted House, Pirates) but after talking to people about how the Fast Passes worked and how quickly they went we decided we were done with Disney Land.",2
"Please understand this is coming from someone who lived half way between Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland. I went to Disneyland the day it opened July 15 1955. I've watched grow, live and die. It was called DISNEYland for a reason. It was the dream of Walt Disney, repleat with HIS characters. There was no lilo and stitch, no beauty and the beast. It has become a joke and a not very funny one at that. Stupid comes to mind when I think of all the characters the idiots have come up with to pass off as disney character, And now star wars, that needs to be part of a new theme park, Lucasland, NOT Disneyland. Sorry Walt, they diddon't know what they were doing when they crushed your dream.",2
"Went over the Columbus Day weekend so it was a lot more crowded than expected. I am a Disney fanatic but this time was awful. Lines were so long and by the time we arrived, most of the Fast Passes were already gone for the day (many rides that used to have them no longer do). Plus the additional thing that has made going to the Magic Kingdom not so magic anymore is the overabundance of mobility carts. I'm all for access but why does it also provide priority over the hundreds standing in line? Entire families of 10 accompany the mobility challenged person into the special access lines. If an able bodied guest arrives and is subjected to a 45 minute wait, why aredon't the cart riders? It gets worse and worse every time I go. Last time I went to California Adventure and the Soaring ride it took a few minutes to even exit the ride because of so many scooters parked in the way.My one very positive comment about my experience this time concerns the quality of food. I think the food has definitely taken a healthier turn and the quality has improved as well. Stands now sell fresh fruit, juices and water. You can still find the bad stuff, but it's a lot easier to eat well.",2
"I normally visit off season, and now I remember why: The fact that we paid $50 each for  Twilight  tickets and only got to 8 rides, was a joke, especially since two of the rides were only to get us across the park and avoid the jam of people sitting around waiting for the parades & fireworks shows.Too many rude people..... Does No one say  Excuse Me  when they cut in front of you any longer. You Stop in the middle of a crowded walk way to talk on your phone?Too long of a wait for the rides 90 minutes for Space Mountain? Rather than giving out all the Fast Passes at one time, instead why not portion them out, a set number per hour? Expensive food does not equate quality. Too many unhappy children. Why do people bring children under 4 years old and force them to stay after 7:00 8:00 p.m.? Why take a small child in to the Haunted Mansion and scare the bejeezus out of the child? If I go again, it will be on a weekday and off season......",2
"The happiest place on earth was not as happy as anticipated, there was poor traffic control, the website needs to be updated as there were several inaccuracies which did put a downer on our trip and while the employees were all pleasant they weredon't always particularly helpful and did not enforce the rules at all",2
"Dodon't know what promos or such Disney has going, but this year has been off the charts busy, even on days its not supposed to be.",2
"We are... were as of tomorrow 5 year annual pass holders who travel... traveled at least 2054 round trip 5 or more times a year to visit Disneyland. Yes, you could say we were dedicated and probably a few other descriptive words... So it would take quite a bit to convince this duo and often double duo to say,  Ya, I dodon't think I want to do that again...  We have easily spent close to 100k there in the last 5 years... And although I'm not experienced, make no claim to be experienced, and dodon't currently have any Disneyland stock, I would be selling it now if I did.Oh, this last trip... where to even begin... First off Cars Land is good. Not great. Not comparable to Indiana Jones, but it is not 8 hours of wait time good with 2 successful rides during off season. It cadon't carry Disneyland like they think it can. People aredon't getting off this ride like,  Wow! Amazing!  which you hear and see on so many other rides... Although we pretty much expected this.What we diddon't expect was the other changes... Almost all the rides went down several times over the 6 days we were there. We'd stand in line, the be sent away. Go stand in another line and be sent away... People just weredon't walking around with that same  Yeah, I'm in Disneyland!  look either. I could see the same opinion on most of the crowds face... It saddened me.And the food... It's not the same. I dodon't just mean the menus because they've changed since June, but the quality. We were ready to order Domino's to our room by day 5... The personnel... Not all the Cast Members by no means! But not just one bad apple either... Clearly there's some problems there in Anaheim and it's showing in how the employees are handling their jobs. Not to mention our new little Cast Member featured in the picture attached... It's a coach roach for those of you like myself are seeing one for the first time, just out side of Thunder Mountain...Somethings got to give. I believe (AGAIN NOT AN EXPERT!!) that Disneyland can ride out this one bad year, but I'm afraid if they dodon't get it figured out they'll not have the same needed numbers of returning visitors and Southern CA just cadon't support this park on their own. I really hope they pull this one out. I dodon't think it's Walt's vision...Respectfully, Once one of Disneyland Biggest Fans...",2
"If you go to Disneyland you need to do your homework   we diddon't. We figured the (expensive) tickets were all we needed  but diddon't know anything about how the Fast Pass system works, how the Magic Morning only applies to Disneyland (not Adventureland) and most parts of Disney are roped off. You can also get in early to start the 'fast pass' process   but we diddon't know anything about that. And the Fast Pass machines are not that easy to find. The best viewing spots for the night time show at Adventureland (World of Colour) are also roped off unless you have  fast passed  a reserved spot, and rides close early when the show is 30 min away. The lines are long, people seem to be grumpy (I actually had another parent confront me in line to tell me I had 'cut in' even though I was patiently waiting there with my 4 year old for over 10 minutes and was behind the same people the whole time).It's almost like you need 'insider info' before you go   we diddon't have it and found the whole thing overwhelming, stressful and disappointing. We did a 3 day pass   should have done 1 day and spent the rest of the time relaxing at the hotel pool where the kids had more fun.",2
People in wheelchairs and people using canes had to wait in long lines. So we diddon't get to do a lot at the park.,2
"Boy, before you purchase Disneyland Passes rethink your decision. The place is overcrowded, overpriced with long line ups for everyone. The Fast Passes do assist a little with the older rides but it's true the new ride  Cars  fast passes were sold out and to stand in line was over 2 hrs!!! I felt sorry for the people and kids in that long line up...waiting...to go on that ride. The food in the restaurants is awful as they are in a hurry to get you in and out due to the volume of people. The bathrooms (when you can find them) are old on the Disneyland side, and for the million plus people that go thru the park the one ladies bathroom, I did find, had one change table, which I thought was sad considering it's suppose to be a park for families. Another disappointment was not seeing Mickey until late in the evening and than...oh guess what...another LINE UP...to have a picture taken with him...Pluto was actually turning away from the kids, etc., as people were trying to get his attention for a picture. It's a BIG park, I'm sure having additional Mickey's etc. walking around the park wodon't matter to people, as long as could get a picture!?! Anyway...for the amount of $$$ you pay, dodon't bother...it really does suck...considering it's suppose to be a fun place. We wodon't return again...considering I diddon't even take my son.",2
"So I pay $800 for the pleasure of taking a family of 4 to the 2 Disney parks, to spend many many hours lined up for rides that last on average 5 minutes. Attention to detail and quality of rides is good, however, park owners please stop being greedy   the park guests numbers allowed on any given day need to be reduced. Shame Disney shame.",2
"I took my 9 year old niece to Disneyland on a Thursday at about 9 am. We got through the first hour easily, and accessed rides and attractions with little wait time. As the time progressed we found that each ride took nearly an hour wait. Although Disneyland has instituted  Fast Pass  which helps, you still have to get to the ride to get a reservation time and then you have to get back there for your reservation. Walking the park takes a lot of time, it is a big place and there are tons of people to navigate through. I personally think they let too many people in the park at one time.The nice thing, they let you bring in food and drink so you dodon't have to stop and wait in line for food and drinks.I feel ripped off, even my niece got tired of all the waiting and wanted to go home after half a day.",2
Lines too long   its old and boring. Food and drink are too expensive... ur already paying $100 a day to get in.,2
"First of all, I've been a big fan of Disneyland, having visited the park many times since my father first took me in 1957. But I took my family of four last week (6 28 & 6 29) and it was NOT  the happiest place on earth  by any stretch of the imagination, with numerous ride closures and interruptions. The first indication of things to come was a distorted speaker in the Indiana Jones car that kept cutting in and out, and made that bumpy ride seem unpleasantly jarring. Then it was a Haunted Mansion closure, a Matterhorn closure, a Space Mountain closure, then Splash Mountain too, if I recall. It was one disappointment after another! We finally got a chance to go in the Haunted Mansion, but there were still technical glitches on that ride that caused it to stop along the way. The next day, we arrived at CA Adventure early enough to get our Fast Pass for the new Cars ride. We returned twice during the day, and both times the ride was down! Then, at the end of our stay, Symphony Swings closed after the first light show, contrary to what we were told by the attendant on duty. An appropriate ending for a not so happy couple of days that cost us over $1000 at the parks alone. We ended up doing a lot more walking and waiting than riding, that's for sure. With ticket prices as high as they are, I cadon't afford to get stung like this again. My girls can return when they're older and able to drive themselves, but I've seen enough to not need to visit again.For anyone else who is dissatisfied with their Disneyland experience I can offer this advice, (given to me by their Guest Communications dept.):  If you encounter any inconveniences or disappointments, please feel free to inform a Cast Member that you would like to speak with a manager. You are also invited to visit City Hall in DISNEYLAND   Park or the Guest Relations Lobby in DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE   Park to register your comments. ",2
"in one word   disappointing. from all the movies i had seen and all the amazing fairytales i had read, i used to imagine that all my kiddie fantasies will come to life here. but the place is boring. and worse, the food options, though plenty, dodon't offer much in terms of variety or taste. the place is super expensive, and the rides are repetitive. take one, and it's the same as having taken a dozen others. only the disney characters change. the souveniours are over priced. now, i know they are always over priced. and i have travelled quite a few places. but this place simply aced all. and why they have split the park in 2 is beyond me. the only logic i find is that it gives them the opportunity of charging people twice for the same kind of rides. if you still want to visit this place, and want to save on some money, please buy tickets only to the  adventures  park (i think that's what it is called. it is the one with a couple of additional rides like  screaming california )",2
"Great idea   i.e. Turkey legs. One leg is enough for 3 and fairly inexpensive. However, a bit too salty",2
"parking garage has a long and complicated walk to the bus stop. Stay at a close hotel and just walk to the park. It will be faster and easier.Two large rides broke down: space mountain and matterhorn.The park was way too crowded. Too difficult to move about the park. Fastpass rides had long waits to redeem the pass and then you still waited in the fastpass line. After the morning, the non fastpass rides are forever long and their estimated wait times were always wrong. However, if they provided a realistic wait time then everyone would probably demand a refund. I was there on a sunday, so maybe avoid the weekends.",2
"Yes, Disneyland has a magic all its own which requires no introduction. Attractions such as Space Mountain, Star Tours 3D and Thunder Mountain are all as memorable as they are breathtaking, however, all time between these attractions was spent being jostled about and almost being bowled over by aggressive mothers pushing impossibly large strollers. Seriously, what is an infant going to remember or appreciate about a visit to Disneyland? Make sure you visit the main attractions listed above, make time for the Dumbo ride, as well as the Mad tea party (our personal favourite; quirky and with slightly malicious musical effects) and get out as quickly as you can. If you intend on staying for the fireworks display, be prepared to be seated and hemmed in well before 2130, otherwise you will spend the rest of the time being marshalled about in smiling but unyielding style by the grinning staff in a never ending gymkhana to nowhere.",2
"I have been to Disney World and on paper, it makes Disneyland look like a joke. I went in having positive thoughts, but just did not have a great experience all around. The rides (comparing to Disney World) are actually a lot shorter (with the exception of Pirates of the Caribbean). There really isdon't a hole lot to do in these parks. Due to wait times, we pretty much spent the entire day at Disneyland till the park closed. The prices on food are very pricey and the quality in my opinion is very poor. I diddon't care to much for the staff at here. In Orlando, everyone has such a different attitude. I came across a couple rude employees and unhelpful ones as well. Not mention that throughout the day, certain rides were going down and not functioning. That is by far the last thing that I would expect from Disney. All in all, if you can go to Florida, by all means.... go to Florida and do not waste your time here.",2
"Greed seems to have taken over   I spent the HIGH price of admission to stand in line. The entire day I got on ONE ride. It is a must see for every child however parents, be prepared to stand and wait. If you have a week to spare, then it's the place to go",2
"Yes its Disneyland so that's awsome, but the crowds since we were here 3 years ago are over the top. Unless you have smaller kids that really need to see Disneyland first hand, trust me, you will have a far better time, and experience many more thrills in the day at other parks.In addition, foods prices have increased signicantly and the LA Times have just reported that ticket prices will be increasing again, why? apparently because they have figure people will pay the price in any case!",2
"Grad days got us too.Wait times were horrendous , waiting 45 minutes for a 3 minute ride.But it was the staff were indifferent and quite rude , waiting in the mid of a walk way (by a show) so my people could see me and was asked to move on three times. Then letting other people push in in lines etc , had enough by lunchtime .... some of the rides have been updated brilliantly   peter pans flight was wonderful , still similar but sparklerer .Also disapointed about no fireworks during windy nights. Both parks shows are really badly run , should have an ampetheatre, i wouldnt do it again , and that theres even a queue to meet the characters , and if you stop them for a pic they were quite rude. (mary poppins even)",2
"The day would have been wonderful except that we lost our backpack with car keys, ID, & credit cards on the Indiana Jones ride. I was sent away 3 times and waited 6 hours to get it back. It was only returned because my 7 yr old was crying in front of everyone that they would not let us leave. So much for happiest place on earth. I was 2 hours late for the meds I had in the same bag. They were going to make me wait until the park closed to get it (12 midnight). They did take pitty on us at dinner time and gave us a voucher to Pizza Port so I could feed my daughter something. But only because I pointed out I had no money. When they finally stopped the ride to get my backpack, turns out there was a whole lot of belongings on the track, like a another womens purse! I felt bad that I was inconviencing people waiting in line, but really. I waited patiently 6 hours. They need to have a better plan. I think our annual trip will be to Magic Mountain from here on out.",2
"We booked a stay at DL 3 years ago and while it was a wonderful experience, the amount of e mail spam we receive is totally out of control. They take your email address and immediately spread it around to dozens of their businesses... vacations, movie clubs, merchandising, etc., and even if you unsubscribe from one it doesdon't remove you from all the others. So you never know when a new Disney solicitation is going to invade your in box. It's terrible that after 3 years I have opted out of more than a dozen different Disney solicitations (itball began with one single vacation reservation) and yet this spam is still showing up. Today I got one from Disney Digital Books. I opted out of this one too, but who knows which new Disney business the next spam will come from. Really frustrating.",2
I was really hoping to see an amusement based on the Country Bears.  Other than that it was an OK place.  Space Mountain was definitely a favorite.,2
"Have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland but I feel that Disneyland Hong Kong is really too small to be called a Disneyland. It has way too few rides and attractions. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneyland as well. Basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to Disney. The food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive. Bottled water, however, was VERY expensive but they do have water fountains around for you to refill your water bottles. The parade was pretty good. It was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i dodon't see how Disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed Disney property.",3
"Think of it as an intro to Disney magic for the little ones. Almost all of the attractions can be completed in 1.5days.One drawback was the timing. For example, Disney's Storybook Theatre is closed Wed Thu for private events. Some restaurants close mid week Tue Thur as well. So best not to plan your visit during mid week.The biggest disappointment is the food at the Park. Even Maxim's is so so only. The only decent Restaurant is Main Street Corner Cafe and the Main Street Bakery. And do be prepared for the typical abrupt HongKong style service from the serving staff.",3
"We brought tickets before we left and got 2 days for less than the price of 1. After visiting would advise everyone to look for an online deal not worth the walk up price. Castle was closed due to that area being refurbished and altered, weekday aprox no more than a 30 min wait for rides with most being less than that would not recommend weekends or holidays. As has been said like all Disney parks and theme parks in general food and drink is expensive .This is a small park and can easily be done in 1 day",3
Around   60 per person and if you want to eat or drink at any point it was cost you a small fortune. If you go on a week day like we did I assume like us you will wait around half an hour per ride. At the time we went the Disney castle was under construction.. it doesdon't look like it will be finished soon. Fast track is free for everyone but single rider was a lot faster. An average day at an expensive place. ,3
"First off I'm not a really big Disneyland fan. I live about 20 minutes from the California Disneyland, and havedon't been in over 10 years (by choice). We were on vacation in Hong Kong and were able to get free tickets, so why not. First getting there by subway from downtown was super easy. I will say I was impressed with how the train that takes you there was decked out in all the Disney themes. Next the park was okay just super small compared to the one here in California. The castle was under construction so that kinda of sucks and the train diddon't run. We went on a Wednesday so it was slow. There are not a lot of rides, so please dodon't come with that idea. It's a nice place for little kids, but thrill seekers stay at home. One tip make sure you read the description of each ride before you wait in line, because I will never get those 30 minutes of my life back (Iron man experience).",3
Mickey and the Wounderous book was great and the kids love it. The new Ant man attraction was good for all ages. Our four year old love the pubs afraid waiting in line because of the loud noises. The 10 year old was afraid of Iron Man   s ride it   s good for 12 and I   ll probably but it was a great ride. The castle is under major construction so there   s no fireworks. Overall the park is still beautiful and wonderful to visit and buy the teacup ride there is a good restaurant that has Standard Chinese food at reasonable prices for Disney. You   ll Have a great day or two. Still probably the best attraction in Hong Kong for children one of the top two for sure. Adults can go on roller coasters and other rides as well they will not be disappointed. ,3
"I   ve been to Hong Kong Disneyland twice and even with new attractions such as the Ant Man and the Wasp, the experience was really flat and not as enjoyable as other Disneylands in the region. With Sleeping Beauty Castle under renovation, pictures taken at the main square isn   t that appealing with the scaffolding in sight. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneylands. ",3
Disneylands the world over are generic apart from the language. This was no different than the others. It was a shame about all the building work and some closed eating areas.  Definitely worth a visit if you have young children.,3
"This was my second trip here, the first been about 3 years ago. This is a smallish Disneyland park. The attractions are of a high standard but there are few thrill rides and no outdoor roller coaster. The park was clean and tidy. Food was expensive in the park not of an excellent qualify (ie served like warm or cold) and there were few vegetarian options.The castle was under renovation at the time of my visit. The park is easy to walk around and many of the attractions are great for kids. Lines were virtually non existent with our longest wait 20 minutesOverall worth a visit if you are with the kids in Hong Kong and have the time. The park entry is also comparatively inexpensive when compared to other Disneyland parks.",3
"I need to say I have been to    home of Disney    Disneyland Anaheim. HK Disney is about an 8th of that park!    Biggest ride    (as in scary) was Space Mountain. Mostly kiddy rides other than that. We did really enjoy the Lion King show. I can   t get over how expensive it was. Water equates to $6 AUD a small bottle and a burger combo meal equated $22 AUD!!!! We also stayed at Disney Hollywood Hotel   where they have u by the balls and charge insane prices ($120 AUD) for buffet dinner or $55 AUD for breakfast. There are no shops   cafes   supermarkets nearby to grab a snack or cheap dinner, unless u take 2 trains! After travelling thru HK  China for 3 weeks it was just crazy expensive for crappy deep fried food or a flavourless bowl of lettuce salad. Very few food places open. Castle under maintenance. Train under maintenance. vouchers we got on the way in stating ALL shops on main st have 10% discount before 1030... then told at bakery    that not here   ?!!! At home that   s called false advertising?!! Toy Story land was insanely hot   no shade, sun bouncing off light concrete   my husband actually had a hypo while waiting for daughter on ride coz it   s so hot. Come on Disneyland... surely you can put up some    camo style shades    so waiting parents don   t pass out?! A few seats for elderly wouldn   t go astray either. All up pretty disappointing experience and about $900 AUD poorer, for 2 adults & 1 child for 2 day pass (note: u won   t need to go back for a second day). ",3
The park is great if this is the only amusement park available to you. It is small and the rides are very tame. The park can be done in 3 4 of a day. Disney is always clean and has the best customer service.,3
"Good to see while here, but very small. Great if we brought the children, but not for adults who have been to other ones. Not exciting for bigger children either.",3
"The Hong Kong Disneyland is quite small, there are too many people and the waiting line is long. it took average one hour or more in the line. however, the transit Disneyland tram is very nice, very impressive!",3
It was ok. This Disney is more catered for smaller children rather than adults. Some of the areas were closed. There was only one really thrilling ride. the rest are for children. Maybe needs a few more western restaurants as well.,3
"Way smaller then the others and staff did not interact with kids as much as every other then park around the world. Signs to go where hard to read.. Arrows pointing in random direction, son is autistic so got told to take him around to priority que but who knows where that was.. Not many ques. Which was a bonus. Toilets plentiful and clean. Good shading and plenty of seats. ",3
We had a local family member to take us round and he knew all the tricks to get around but the park is so super busy with so many queues. Kids enjoyed. I think evening is way better as easier to get on rides without queues! Avoid weekends and local holidays! The lion king show was fabulous! ,3
"It   s a very huge game cum theme park, so if you are travelling with cute little ones make sure you have enough things to eat and drink. Although lot of restaurants and eateries are there but most of them are occupied in peak hours. It is an evolving theme park with addition of new games every year I liked the stark area in sci fi zone. I waited till 8 pm and witnessed the Disney   s signature parade too. Please expect waiting time of 20 30 mins for each ride.",3
"We were disappointed with HK Disneyland. The train wasdon't running and the Castle was under renovation, as were several other areas. It had an air of dilapidation. Our coach driver advised us to take food in, not in our bags, which would be searched, but in our pockets. The reason for this was that They want to make you pay the incredibly high prices for food they sell. He also suggested not buying souvenirs there, but taking a picture, then getting the item from Ali Baba (or Ali Express I suppose). A basic souvenir mug cost A$20 approx, and watches were about A$80. The parade though, was fantastic, and made up a lot for the rest of it. It's on twice a day, in the afternoon and evening. The fireworks that we'd previously seen there were suspended for a while, due to the renovations. An MTR station is right there at the gates   change at Central for other lines. There's also a ferry but it limits you to certain times of leaving, so MTR, taxi or bus is better. For a senior, HK$2 on the Oyster Seniors card gets you all the way back to a station close to your hotel, so dodon't bother with a tour. ",3
"Visited this theme park on 26.02.19. Overall, it was okay. Nothing spectacular. I have previously been to Disneyland Anaheim, Disney World Florida, Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disneyland Disneysea. HK Disneyland is tiny, but fortunately not many crowds. The haunted house (mystic manor) was weird, though. I would expect something along the lines of other Disneyland parks, but yeah maybe it   s a cultural thing (nothing beats haunted house in Universal Studios Singapore during Halloween Horror Nights, fyi). Overall, my kids had fun there. Main reason why we went to Disneyland.",3
"Having been to Florida, Anaheim and Euro Disney, Hong Kong Disney is definately the smallest, however given 5 hours to a day of spare time we think it is worth a visit. Limited number of rides but still fully professionally set up in true Disney style. The shows equally up to Disney standard. ",3
"In HK now crowds are the norm, and Disneyland is no exception. It was a weekday but was still very crowded, I hate to think what its like on the weekend.Some areas were unavailable due to remodeling works, which was sad, but some new areas had been opened since our last visit and these were quite good.There are lots of rides for  children  of all ages, so enjoy yourself and have a good day.Buy your ticket before you arrive, saves time and some queues, and many times they are cheaper than at the gate.Easily accessible by the MRT from all over HK. Its not the biggest Disneyland in the world, but it made our little one smile all day.",3
"It   s our first Disney experience. And I think it   s a great location to start. Ppl said HK Disneyland is smaller than one is Tokyo (which it is). It helps us not feel overwhelmed.A ride for each ride is not too long. Maybe because it was raining on the day. We didn   t get to see many characters for the same reason.Unfortunately, the castle was under maintenance. So we didn   t get the full experience. But all in all, it was fun.",3
"It is a relatively small park, cannot be compared to the ones in Florida for sure! Worse off, we hit the park when the castle was closed for upgrade and no fireworks offered.Most of the park staff we came across were unfriendly and not very helpful with the odd exceptions! In fact they have  Smile  stickers at the entrance turnstile...it must be there to remind park staff since most of us visiting Disney parks have inherent great expectations!",3
"The rides are meant more for children except a few that are more thrilling. The decorations, however, were really detailed and brings out the Disney effect. It was nice to see that and really brings out the 'child' in me. Great atmosphere, great people! Overall, if you are going as a family with young children, you will definitely have a good time. However, if you are looking for thrill rides, better head to Ocean Park instead!",3
"I   m a big Disney fan so was super excited to visit HK Disneyland. Although we had a fun day.. I can   t help but feel disappointed. The park was very small and I feel the price is extortionate when comparing it to Disneyland Paris   which is much larger and significantly cheaper. I found that it didn   t have the magic of Disney and it just felt like any old theme park. The staff were not particularly friendly and they didn   t engage with guests at all   in fact, I was ignored by a group of 3 staff members! Having said this.. mystic manor is quite possibly my new favourite Disney ride ever   you really have to go on it!! ",3
This is the first time we visited Hong Kong Disneyland.. We decided to go to Disneyland during chinese new year holiday.. It was so crowded and not really enjoy the attraction..,3
There is some wonderful excitement built on the train ride to Disneyland with the cute Mickey themed carriage. We enjoyed Mickey waffles while there and the Lion King Show. Other than that the lines for rides were very long and I felt the experience was quite overrated. I MUCH preferred Ocean Park.,3
"Small Disneyland compared to Paris and the attractions are espcially for kids and only some of them for adults. We came here after the Typhoon so some attractions were closed. The price is a bit high for what you get. Overall we had a great time and it took us about half day to finish all the park. If you are looking for thrill attractions for adults, Ocean park is much more better!",3
"Very small Disneyland compared to the other countries. Beautiful Disney themed train to reach the park. Big disappointment due to the Disney castle closed down and no fireworks, friendly staff and very helpful",3
"The place is nice, but, after i have visit in Paris and USA, this one its not that great.  it's feet more to little children.  The show at the evening was great.  I really waited to the  space mountain  but it was nice only.",3
"This is just for kids only. Very small in comparison to Disneyland, in USA. Most of the animals were just toys; not real animals.  Anyhow a good start is made !!",3
"What we diddon't like was the unhelpfulness of the staff. We had pre purchased meal vouchers which we lost soon after entering the park. When we went back to one of the stores to check if we dropped it there while paying for merchandise the store lady was very rude. She rudely asked bow do we know it's your even if we find it. I asked her how many other people have come looking for their food vouchers, she said none. I coulddon't believe how crass these people were. We requested the reception to reprint the voucher since they had bar code and they refused saying they cadon't. This just shows how backward their technology is. It's not a big deal to reprint the same bar code. If someone had already used our voucher the bar code woulddon't work anyway so no harm in reprinting it.We were there during the Christmas holidays. It was crowded but well organised. Some of the places were closed since they are expanding. The parade was fun and so we're the ride especially star wars and the grizzly gulch.",3
"Always wanted to see Disneyland and when I had the chance, Christmas Eve 2018, I was disappointed. Maybe if I had been 7 and not nearly 70 I might have enjoyed it more. I expected to see a lot more characters and not be confronted by closed exhibits.",3
"Sorry to say but the most interesting part was probably the Disney themed train for the final leg of our journey, As seniors we thought that the day would be a leisurely one with plenty of rest stops. Not even close.The only postive was taking the    train    around the outskirts which told us there wasn   t much to see, less enjoy. Rides were for 10 12yo and under and their parents carers. Food drinks overpriced and not what an Aussie would consider half decent.Highlight was photo of    Thanks for visiting Disneyland   ",3
After going to euro disney in paris and disney land its a bit disappointed to go to disney in hong kong. you will feel the disney vibes but it is very small and only 3 or 4 attractions for adults. for children it is great and they will enjoy int ,3
A tad disappointing after Paris Disney as it is small and has only a few fun rides. Most disappointing was the lack of variety in the retail therapy!!!! Sorry Disney but I   d go to Ocean Park next time.,3
"A good day out which tired kids out, but unfortunately did not have time to do much due to queues and waiting around.  Been there, done it probably would not choose to go back, especially for the price(s).",3
Whilst there was not as many rides as Disneyland Paris it was still a good day out. The light show was great. There seemed to be a lot of rides and cafes closed. We knew that the castle wouldn   t be open but I was a little disappointed about the other rides especially considering the cost of tickets.,3
"There were only about two rides in each of the lands areas and several of those rides were closed. The park is small and so each of the rides are compacted into small spaces. The rides were short. The best show was the Lion King, Moana was disappointing. The lines were only 15 30 minutes waiting time. It's about $80 to get in. They have cooked squid they sell at kiosks and it tastes like beef jerky. You can take the subway to get to Disneyland",3
"If you haven   t been at other Disney, you will have abre at time specially if visiting with children. If you   ve visited Disneyland in California or Disney World in Florida you   ll be disappointed here. It is like all Disney   s very pretty but way too far, complicated to get there, expensive and small! Very few attractions and with only the oldest classics of the park like Jungle River Cruise, Dumbo, It   s a Small World, etc. ",3
Brought mum for the first time to Disneyland when she is 62. She loves it as much as I do. Bought merchandises for her to wear just like the children in d park!Toilets however can be cleaner and should have queue for elderly for the rides.,3
There are more people here than the other themepark but this one is small and not much rides attractions. It is only because of the name that people flock this place. There are other countries with good Disney park but not this one.,3
"Disneyland   Oceanpark   Be there by 12PM and 1 day is more than enough. Boring for thd adults but decent not great just decent for kids depending on how much they love the disney characters. If its just your curiosity to experience the hype of Disneyland then please opt for Oceanpark. Amazinb rides, and many themes like zoo, aquariums, waterpark and rollercoaster rides to experience. Definitely the better option.",3
After visiting Florida Disney World three times it is hard to have anything that will live up to the one in Florida. We love Disney and the magic spirit it creates. Hongkong Disney is very small. We went over the part in 6 hours so buying more than a 1 day pass is not necessary.If you just love to walk around and feel the atmosphere this is perfect.,3
"This Disney is very small and one day pass was more than adequate. The castle was closed off for refurbishment, so no nice pics of the castle or sounding area, the castle is also only half the size of other disney resorts. The Mickey light show in main street was excellent and very well done but sadly the night show that we waited for was cancelled 2 mins before it was due to start because of about 3mins of a VERY light rain shower. We have visited Florida Disney many times and it is obviously far superior but the main comment I have to say is that every single staff member at Hong Kong looked miserable and that they diddon't really want to be there, by comparison Florida staff are bursting with smiles and fun. Not many large rides here and only two fast pass rides. We ate at the Chinese restaurant which was just average food. I would definitely recommend a visit and for those that can 't compare to other Disney parks you'll have a great day out.",3
"have not visited HK disneyland for a few years. compare to last time, toy story is good place to visit. but the star wars theme in tomorrowland is a big disappointment. we queued for long time for commander at post    just one was there R2D2   Shanghai disneyland is much better here. but the 8pm paint the night parade is fantastic!",3
"I think the hype about Hong Kong Disneyland Resort is more that the deliverable. The actual experience was not what I expected. The expectation was actually too much with all the video and pictures on line.There were very few characters to mingle with. A couple of them just came out a few minutes for picture shoots and headed back in. The on line videos showed Disney characters just walking around the park, interacting with people, making the ambiance of the park more Disney like. This was actually the expectation. I was expecting Cylons, Jedis, Mickey, Minne. Goofy, etc to been seen in the park. But unfortunately, we actually had to look for them.The entertainment in itself was not bad. The place was clean and the staff friendly. But the magical experience did not reach its peak.Dodon't go there with too much of expectation, or else you might be disappointed like I was. Worth a visit but not for repeats.",3
"I have been going to HK disneyland several times. Not much change. The parade is still the same and the attraction as well. New attraction is coming but unfortunately replacing my daughter favorite attraction. Some part near the castle is closed for renovation, make it not pleasant to take a picture. For those whom has not visited the park, it will be nice to experience it but after several times it will be boring.",3
"This place is overrated. Entrance fees are expensive, the queues for rides are very long, the crowd is horrible. Tokyo Disneyland is much better. Btw, Ocean Park is way better!",3
"We visited Hong Kong Disneyland with our two sons who are in their twenties. We seemed to enjoy it more than them! Lots to see and do, but most on a very tame level. If you prefer the more exciting rides, head over to Ocean Park. But for us, Disneyland was the happiest place on earth that day.It is expensive, yes, but just make the most of it and laugh along with all the others who are there for the day. Remember, if you are 65 and over, there is a huge discount! Normal entry fee is HKD615 and over 65 is HKD100. You cadon't purchase senior tickets online and have to do it when you are there. Many said that the officials dodon't ask for proof of age when you purchase this ticket, but they did ask us. So make sure you have this with you!Great day, thoroughly enjoyed it!!",3
"Compare it to universal studios, Disneyland hongkong is overrated! 1. Tickets are Expensive because half of the theme park is under renovation! 2. Food is way too expensive for a no quality product. They should have at least upgrade the taste, serving and of course presentation. 3. Photo ops with mascots is 15 minutes only. They should have additional time or Atleast post the timeline in a map direction for visitor   s reference! 4. Sellers here are rude! They will not give you unless you pay first, (as if you   re not going to pay if you order duh ) 5. Good for kids who don   t like extreme rides. 6. Picture in maze imposed limited time also. We recommend for children but not with teens who enjoy extreme rides! 7. Food and drinks from outside is prohibited. Again, as if the food here is awesomely tasteful! It   s really a waste of money to eat here. NO QUALITY!!!!! But rather pricy.",3
too many china pple pushing and shoving you around without an apology! so Traumatic. Visited last year and this year...nth much has changed. I prefer Tokyo Disneyland!,3
"December is the best of the year toBe at Disneyland. It   s so festive , only problem is the huge crowd due toHoliday season. Kids age 4 8 will enjoy all the kids rides .. there are few good rides only for adults . How   re they have done a good job with so many activities and well connected zones. Mystic Manor was scary and funny. The big FrizY mountain mine car was amazing ... the best ride here .The wondrous magical story was an amazing show. Don   t miss it. Few very kiddies rides are there which u can easily do in any park. The Iron man sharks was a good thriller ride. Tomorrow land has a good food court and the best food was at the Explorer   s restaurant next to Mystic Manor. Good Indian Food. Very expensive but u have no Choice as outside food is not allowed. It was cold day when we visited so needed jackets. Overall a fun filled experience! Recommend it! ",3
"To be fair this was never going to rival the parks of Florida, however there is a fair selection of rides including Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain. This is geared more towards the younger Disney fan. Parades are great and there are a good number of shows and opportunities to meet the main characters. Park is very clean though staff have not adopted that American style and focus on customer service, staff were good but not over the top out to make your day magical. Worth a visit if you have a spare day. ",3
"Being Hong Kong I thought it was going to be soo much better than what it is. Only about 3 'big' rides in the whole park & I woulddon't consider them big in comparison to places like Thorpe Park or Alton Towers.Happy to say that I have been there, but woulddon't recommend a thrill seeker to go there.",3
"Went here on December 12, the weather was cold not crowded at all. Unfortunately, if you are planning to visit the Sleeping Beauty Castle you'll be disappointed because it is under renovation. There's also no Fireworks. Also when we visited the Jungle River Cruise was unavailable. The kids love the place, but there are a lot of constructions going on.",3
"Lot of constructions on the way, tones of visitors inside the souvenir shop without crowd control. Almost 30 mins line up on cashier check out.",3
"Hong Kong  Disneyland is the smallest of all Disneylands.  Suitable for  young children .   We travelled with teenagers, as such  did not offer the  excitement of other Theme Parks.The Park is very clean  and well maintained.",3
Disneyland is Disneyland and if you have been to one I wouldn   t recommend going to visit! With kids yes but it is overpriced and a little boring to be honest,3
"Took my daughter to HK Disneyland for her 5th birthday. Disneyland hotels are hugely overpriced, so we booked a hotel outside Disney. The Park itself is beautiful, so are most of the shows  I loved Magic Manor and my daughter loved the Lion King show. The parade was great, but a bit too short. A few things went bad though  lots of waiting for every ride  15 25  minutes. Kids got tired and we gave up on some rides. The food is overpriced and tasted bad  The Main Dining Hall (up to 20 USD for a tasteless meal), food stalls with outdated corn for 4 USD 4, sausages 5 USD. Actually all soft drinks in the Park cost HKD 32 ( 4  USD) and you are not allowed to bring your own food! Another point  it's close to Christmas time, a lot of Christmas music was being played non stop including Church hymns like Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, O Come All Ye Faithful, etc. Sounds too religious, not suitable for kids, a bight of brainwashing so to say. And no wi fi at the park at all. For the families with young kids I recommend 1 day visit after a heavy breakfast.)",3
"It is a must have trip if you have kids! Got the kids dressed up in princesses for them to enjoy this magical experience. My child was given a birthday badge by the hotel and she could pin in and get recognised in Disneyland. We have received complimentary ice cream at restuarant and some staff would wish Happy Birthday.However, it is prob my last time gg to Disneyland HK as the 1) Lion King show was the same as 10 yrs ago. 2) experience of being pushed by rude mainland Chinese in queues was not pleasant at all. Perhaps Disneyland SEA in Japan would be a much better choice.",3
"Visited this theme park 4 times over the past years. Its getting old and it shows. Time to give the place a spruce & add in more new rides, otherwise it will lose its visitors to other theme parks in the region",3
"If you move fast, you can get thru the park in a day knowing that you won   t see everything. It   s certainly not packed like LA Disneyland or Disney World. Most of the rides in Small World are the same sans Peter Pan. Their rides in some of the areas are different. Food is really bad. Jr Yelper said we should eat at the best restaurant in the part, The Explorer Club with a variety of ethnic selections to order. But at nearly $20 a plate with meager portions, it was the worse Disney park meals I   ve ever had. The Jungle Ride was closed the weekday we went. They had 2 different Disney ice cream pops sold at the carts. One is blueberry and the Minnie is Strawberry for $5 USD. They were OK. The evening light show was basically flashing lights of Mickey and friends on the buildings. The electric parade was really good. We watched part of the Moana show. We were so bored and the singing was mediocre so we left. This is the 4th of the Disney parks we   ve been to and easily ranks at the bottom. ",3
"Being from FL we had to check it out, sadly I think we were better off spending a second day at Ocean Park.",3
"Although we were given 8 priority pass from our kingdom club stay, we didn   t managed to use any of it. The queue were generally not too Long except for photos with iron man and the smaller kids ride.The priority pass Given to us were only applicable to 5 rides, it would definitely serve us better if it   s applicable to all other rides. As we have very young kids, rides like toy story parachute, slinky dogs etc would attract younger kids more and we couldn   t use it.I would think it would be better if Disneyland can share when and where the character would appear. Like Disneyland LA, more characters will appear in different time slot. These information weren   t available anywhere... ",3
Had Visit on the 5th of Nov. Sadly alot of rides and attraction is close.  Besides that the place is clean and well kept.,3
"Who wouldn   t want to celebrate their birthday , at least once in Disney ! So do I . However , I felt that Disney Hong Kong is a poorer cousin as compared to Tokyo. I supposed this comes from different management . Everyone knows Japanese are meticulous to the last details. Whilst, in Hong Kong , I suppose they have practical mindset rather than imagination. They are doing the basic normal job in a magical place .. what a waste . They have plenty of room to improve to make the best place as magical as possible . ",3
Overall the place was ok but many attractions were closed with no reduction to the entry price. The attractions were OK but nothing like I expected at a Disney Park. Only the Americans can do Disney!!!! All in all though it was an OK day out.,3
"We visited HK Disneyland on our last day in Hong Kong, the food was great, but as to be expected over priced and the lines were a nightmare! A lot of the rides with audio only had it in Cantonese   understandable because your in HK, however, it   s a bit of a let down if you don   t understand it.",3
"We went there , but frankly speaking travelling to other Disneylands , this one could do better. We didnt see the night parade since it was on HOLD for quite some time know . Overall , It is too pricey for the enjopyment expected.",3
A fairytale place to visit when you are in HK. The easy and cheaper way to Disney Land is taking MRT.,3
"During the time of my visit there, there were partial closure of the park due to private event on the 2nd and 3rd of November. I came all the way from Indonesia, paying expensive airfares, and also paying expensively for a 2 night stay at your hotel. But during my visit there, several sections, such as Adventureland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.To make matters worse, the closure was done during the prime time of the park, around 2 3 pm all the way to the dark around 6 pm, and in some cases even until Disney closed. I was very disappointed in this, and I would like to see some responsibilities from Disney regarding this issue. Disney should've given a certain reduction on the hotel price and or Day Pass price due to this  incomplete magical experience .",3
"Disneyland is one of the major attractions for Tourists visiting HongKong.However, it is very very expensive! Apart from that it is a heaven for kids!",3
"Small park, just didn   t feel like Disney, lion king show was cancelled to park attendees as they booked a private part all day, unfair I thought, some restaurants were closed, the castle was a building site, very poor considering we still payed full price, mentioned to Disney customer services but was brushed off with reply that I should have checked web site day before for closures! Bit crap when I bought the ticket 2 months earlier, I   d not be returning, really poor excuse for a Disneyland! ",3
Much smaller than the California Disneyland but almost identical in some respects.  Can be covered easily in half a day.,3
"My first time at a Disneyland was rather disappointing; the queues were terribly long, the food was massively overpriced, and the rides were hardly thrilling. I supposed this park is catered mostly towards touristy families with young children, because there are much better things to do in Hong Kong and better cheaper theme parks such as Ocean Park. My advice is to go ahead to HK Disneyland if you are travelling with children or the elderly and have quite a bit of money to spare as it is a small theme park with expensive food and souvenirs but is extremely tourist friendly. If not, explore Hong Kong in its authenticity instead!",3
"Had a seventeen hour layover in Hong Kong so we took our daughter to Disneyland as a special treat for her and to fill in time. She loved it. My wife and I were a little disappointed getting pictures with Micky and Minnie was a task in its self, lines so so long no shade and kept getting closed off, so had to keep going back and start over again.wich made it a very long day. All in all still a great day for kids. Even with the lineups it   s still worth taking the little ones too.",3
Visiting Disneyland is dream for Kids & adults as well. We visited earlier in Paris but first time for my boy. The Disney train is really really lovely. Unfortunately during our visit the Main castle was closed for renovation & many other rides were closed due to Typhoon hence had limited choice. Even in evening the fireworks was cancelled & replaced with Parade which was good.Too small compare to the one in Paris with two attractions Disney Park & Studio but still good.Suggest to book ticket in advance preferable online at discounted price.,3
"We went as a day trip when staying in HK.Travel   easy to get to on MTR and then hop on the special Disney train with Disney ears windows and handrails. Nice touch!Park   not the biggest of a Disney parks, one main ride per area plus some smaller ones. The castle is quite small (and at Oct 18 was undergoing maintenance and boarded up which was a shame). Some rides we hadn   t been on at other Disney parks.   The haunted mansion was actually quite good.   Iron Man the screen was blurred so didn   t rate it.   very clean and good staff  guests are all polite and everyone queues...I only mention this as this is not the same in eurodisney!",3
"The area is small though with the standard attractions of Disneylanin. The food iside the park is expensive as other Disneylands. However, still a good place for kids under 10. As it is not that big, it is good enough for one day tour and not too tiring. A lot of places to take photos. Better not to choose October or Chinese New Year as it will be crowded to serve the huge Chinese visitors.",3
Too small and nothing much to see.Got done in half a day with most attraction not worth the money here,3
"Like any other theme park, there are numerous shops selling overpriced merchandise. The lines were short and there was no wait getting in. The biggest letdown was the price getting in which worked out to be around AUD$220 for two Adults. Food was typical theme park quality. If you must see Disney or have kids then it is probably worth a trip.Tip: Take an umbrella for sun shade.",3
"If not for Disneyland theme , I really not found it worth spending your full day on this. Quite expensive too and far from the city. I feel Ocean Park is a much better alternative to spend a day.",3
"The all park is nice BUT how is possible that you come there with kids and want to take some photos with famous Disney cartoons like Mickey and Minnie and they don   t let you. Ok I understand that people need rest but than you need to have few of this cartoons to take photos not just one. They are photographying for 1 hour after that they are on pausa another hour and people are waiting them to come back, they let group of people after that they say it   s over no more photos.... I don   t understand that policy",3
Had an awesome day and everything was great if not better then I thought APART from seriously disappointed with the    Journey to Halloween town   ! It ended so randomly after 5 walk throughs and majority in cantonese only (4 out of 5) On top of all we hardly queued at all the rides and waited the longest to go to this! 45 minutes. Whoever came up with the walk through story needs to sort out the    ending    of it. The actors tress were great though especially Sally the Rag Doll (shes really amazing from her make up to her voice) Jack was of course good and the themed rooms and decoration. But really got to pay attention from the start to end! Ending really impacts the guests impression too and our whole group of 12 15? were like wtf at the end. Something tells me lack of budget might have affected the ending? ,3
good....MTR make it approachable....good staff... buy ticket online....or contact your hotel... one day is not enough atlest with children... food is horrible ...not for vegetarians...,3
I have been to Tokyo and LA Disneyland!I also visited this disneyland back in 2006.Back in 2006 i was disappointed as it was very small but after 12 years its been well and truly expanded!Only thing missing for me was Toon town but a great day or 2 can be had for people with young children under 12.2 day pass was around $400 AUD for 2 adults and 2 kids!Worth the visit if you have never been before.Suggest train,3
"Its famous attraction of hong kong probably because of its brand. However, I diddon't find any extra ordinary ride s or show s in this theme park. I would rather suggest spend one extra day in Ocean park.",3
"Was a good day out, no waiting in line. Would of been good if the castle was open. Closed for refurbishment which was a shame",3
"Not much to say, it's a nice park, nice to walk around and take in the atmosphere but other than that there is not much there for big kids. There were no looping rides and everything inside was too expensive (usual). Worth going for one day, you should be able to do everything you want within the day.",3
"For those who have not been to any part of disneyland in the world, i guess this HK Disneyland is good enough and wow you. However, the place is clean, and for Muslim tourists, you dont have to worry about getting Halal food and Musollah, they provide and cater for you. We do have fun in Mystic Manor, Grizzly grunch and Space mountain. One day is enough for you to look around and ride everything plus to shop and the parade. But, do go there during weekdays, the queue will not take long, as maximum will get you only 10 minutes per ride. We did enjoy anyway. But to take photos with the icons, you have to queue as they have only specific spot just for photography. ",3
"The Disneyland HK is little overrated, though there are few interesting rides  events activities, the full park was flooded with regional tourists & long delays made the fun fly away.",3
"I have visited both the Walt Disney World and the Disneyland in Ca, this is a small one.  However, in the plus side, it's not as crowed and the admission is not as expensive as Walt Disney World and Disneyland in Ca.",3
"Ok so my family and I have been to Disneyland in LA and Paris. This Disneyland is similar in style to the others. It is smaller with less thrilling rides. We went on a Monday off peak. Most rides had a five minutes queue. I will pull recommend this park for parents who hate rollercoasters, have young kids who want to go to Disneyland and cadon't go on rides on their own. The rides in this park is really mild but your kids will get all the experience of being in Disneyland. My daughter really really enjoyed it even though it wasdon't as thrilling as the others.",3
"As part of our trip to Hong Kong, Disneyland was definitely a must do. Having visited other Disneyland   s in the past, this one full filled some of our expectations, but not all.The arrival was easy, as well as entertaining. With special Disney MTR trains, a manicured Station, a grand sign leading up to the park, and a fountain with Mickey surfing above Moby Dick with all his friends watching.We walked straight to the gate queues having bought our tickets (from Klook) and printed them of as instructed. Unfortunately not everyone had done so, and there was chaos as people tried to find get their QR codes to work from their phones as they held up the every increasing line. The park opened at 10am, but no rides were open until 10.30. Even then not all. Sleeping Beauty   s Castle is under refurbishment, so can   t be seen properly or accessed. We rode and enjoyed The Iron Man experience which was a simulation ride, after getting fast passes for Space Mountain. The Jungle Cruise was ok, with queues for the 3 different languages. Don   t be fooled by the short English queue. After riding Space Mountain, we watched the Jedi Training. They catered well again for the different languages using them all. The kids were great.Unfortunately after that the heavens opened, and it poured with rain. There didn   t appear to be enough places for people to shelter, in regards to indoor rides or covered areas. Big puddles everywhere. However the silver lining was they did open Mystic Manor which was closed for the day.Overall not loads of rides, but lots of character meeting areas (with queues of course). Need to be a bit more organised?",3
"The rides are great as Disney   s quality and It is not too crowded so there is no long wait time. However, cast members are below par. Anytime I asked for something, they either tell me to ask other guys or try to answer as quick as possible and walk away. When you are in the line and not pay attention enough, someone will pass you and cut you in front. ",3
August is a rainy season in Hk so prepare for umbrella or rain coat.Get adv online tickets  either printed out on paper or QR code on your phone. You can bet the line a little.The attraction is the same as elsewhere but some of the parks are under renovation. E.g. you cadon't get a good view of the Disney castles due to reno.The hourly shows are in Cantonese except folks songs in English.,3
"We visited the place on Wednesday to avoid the crowd, but unfortunately it was over crowded. We managed to play few rides but the queue was very long for most of the rides. The lion king show was excellent. The whole area is small and the tickets are overpriced. ",3
"The place is nice and clean, but small. It is the smallest Disneyland I have been. The place it is perfect for little kids. Monday it is the best day to go, we diddon't have to wait to use the rides.",3
"This Disneyland is the smallest one compare with all others over the different parts of the world. However, it's amazing for Hong Kong, such a small place, to has a Disneyland. It's fun if you have not been any other Disneyland before. Dodon't expect too much and dodon't try to compare this one with others over different side of the world. I may say all the Disneyland theme parks are about the same, just different sizes and one have more rides than the other.",3
Quite expensive for not so much to see and do. Rides overcrouded with waiting times of an hour or more. If your first time it might be okey but not for a second visit.,3
we when in August and it was Monday and still a lot of people.we did it for the kids but the weather is really hot and humidity is like 80% plus. they do the big pride at the end just before they close and imagine every one going home at the same time.,3
The park has some unique attractions that are not in other Disney parks. The staff is rude and never smile. There's not fireworks show.  The parade and the mapping at night is amazing.  The Iron Man atraction is great.,3
"We visited for our 5 years old birthday, the queues were very long,we benefited from 3 priority pass for 3 d shows, the Mickey magic was one of the best I   ve seen. The parade was also very nice. Tried the train which stoped us after 2 minutes and told us they were closing for technical reasons which was annoying as we had to go back to the entrance to pick up the child cart we left to enter the ride. Not many rides for our son , in fact not many rides in the park we were expecting slightly more. The prices for food obviously high, water included. We had a 2 day pass for the park so we managed to get some pictures with the characters but there are long queues for that as well.",3
Do not use a Travel Package as it is much quicker and easier to use the Mass rapid train system. It goes at far more regular times and you will not be stuck out there for too long. Go early in the day for opening time and have a big breakfast before hand. Take some water as on site prices are very high.Rides where a good highlight and the 3D effects in main theatre where fabulous.Some attractions closed for updates.,3
My beautiful wife and family visited this disney park to have our late teen kids enjoy the experience. Previously l have been lucky enough to visit most other Disney theme parks.Gotta say l was totally underwhelmed and disappointed at what was on offer.lf it wasdon't for space mountain I'm sure my kids were too.Without key attractions found in other parks it was just very flat and ordinary.Probably give this a miss as this is not a true indicator of the full Disney experience.Disappointing..,3
"It's nice as a theme park, there're quite a lot of rides (tho not all of them are so thrilling), the shows are also fabulous. However, there were WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE! Some sort of crowd control should be exercised!",3
"Easy to get to using the MTR, great for little ones obviously.   If you   re looking for some thrills. There   s only 3 real    big rides   .   The castle was smaller than we expected and you can get round the park and everything in a day.",3
"Went to visit this HK Disneyland.  Very small park compared with Eurodisney, parked was packed (we went on a tuesday) and as any disneyland, had to queue up for 45mins average for playing.  There were no  pirates of the caribean  nor  peter pan  attraction.",3
"Our first visit to Disney, much smaller than we expected (compared to Universal and many others)The grizzly mine cars was good experience. Also, kids loved the mystic manor, hyperspace mountain, iron man experience, parachute drop and a couple of shows. Others were mostly routine stuff.Easy to navigate (though a bit hot   in June)Staff were very friendly , everything was well organised. The place is well maintained. Lot of greenery.As expected, food is costly (outside food is not allowed, bags are checked at the entrance).Wifi (free) is not very good, diddon't find their app very useful.The night parade was fantastic and worth the wait.We took a two day pass (is only marginally more expensive than one day ticket)Better to go early (and of course avoid holidays and weekends). Still you might find some school trips which will add to the waiting time.Can be easily accessed by MTR, but we preferred to stay in the nearby Disney hotel (regular free shuttle buses are available)",3
"We only went to Disneyland to buy our Grandkids some Disney Stuff , We got the day tour with pick up from hotel and drop off at night we started about 10 am and got back to the hotel about 11.30 pm as we were the last drop off  the bus left disneyland at 9.45 pm   so it was a big day out. We went on nearly all the rides even MR SLINKY which is a kiddies ride haha and saw two of the shows we even went on one of the rides twice . The final parade was pretty good but i dont think i could have gone a second day as there is just not enough to do ",3
"My 4 year old had fun here but the long lines were a little too much for him. There is a lot to do here. When you factor in the lines, I don   t think anyone can go through the whole park in one day. We saw maybe a third of it. We were at Disneyland for about 6 hours.The food here is highly overpriced. The shops were crowded, but nice for AC. The bathrooms were a bit dirty. The toilets are on the ground (which is good for boys).There were a lot of rude tourists (adults and kids) who appear to be in a rush and were pushing a lot.Overall, it was worth visiting once. I may or may not go back when my son is older, more patient, and can protect himself from the tourists who push. FYI: I asked them at the gate.... If I buy a one day ticket and my son loves it, could I upgrade to the two day ticket and pay the difference before I leave? The answer was no.",3
"Little disappointing as we have been to Disneyland in Anaheim and Florida. This one is much smaller and not as many rides, no water rides at all and with being so hot we were all disappointed with that.Other than that just st a miniature version of the real thing",3
"Ok so they can   t help the heat, but this was my first Disney experience, and for the price you pay to get in (not to mention the buffet at nearly   47 per person) I felt a little cheated. Bar one parade the only characters I actually saw were chip and dale (rescue rangers). Maybe Micky was too busy counting all his money to pop down to see us.... I also question their car number plates.",3
"Very small by Disney standards and aimed at the real littlies. As you would expect, terribly overpriced food which was really ordinary (although the bakery food was pretty good) and only 2 rides which would appeal to real thrill seekers. But the parades were fun to watch, the place is beautifully clean (unlike Disneyland Paris) and a pleasant day if you've got little ones.",3
"As expected of Disney their rides and facilities were top notch, but it was such a dissapointment that the service was not up to that standed.I am aware that Hong Kong culture can come across as being unfreindly, but I expected a lot more of the Disney staff. They were exeedingly unhelpful and made my family and I feel very unwelcome, it woulddon't hurt them to so much as try putting on a smile. Such a shame that the  Happiest place on earth  had the saddest people.",3
It was raining on & off on the day we visited so most of the rides were closed. They did open for a short while but immediately the waiting was at 30 mins each before the rain played spoil sport again. Not many options for older boys. My son   9 yrs was quite bored there. A couple of rides were also out due to technical issues.,3
"the place looks old and outdated  food is expensive  hard to get a coffee anywhere  , layout is all over the place  save your money and go to disneyland tokyo instead",3
If you've been to Euro Disney or Tokyo this has the same kind of not quite right feel. They try hard but it is not America and the attempts to make visitors feel they're in Anaheim or Orlando dodon't quite make it. Prices are higher here too   but that's OK if your kids are having fun.,3
When I got there I was surprised to see how small it was. I have been to the Disney in Florida once before and though the one in Hong Kong would be at least a fifth of the size. Nonetheless there virtually no lines (mainly...More,3
This Disneyland is maintained in good condition. It is alright for 1 2 days of fun with rides for each age and adults too. It lacks in key items such as good restaurants. We wanted to go to exclusive restaurants but there was no help to...More,3
"The trip to HK Disneyland was a blend of good and bad experiences. Firstly it's a bit expensive travel to and fro in MTR form Hong Kong or Central station to Disneyland. The entry ticket pass is also expensive. The only recommendation I would give is if you have been to any other disneyland's in the world or especially paris, skip this one for sure. There's no need to waste your time, money and a whole day for this place. I have been to another 3 disney's including paris and I am telling you from my experience. It is seriously not worth it. If you have kids who are under 15 then you can surely opt a day out in disney but if you are traveling adults or teens like me in early 20's then it's a strict no. They dodon't have any thrilling rides for adults or teens. Though the whole idea behind creating a disney park is for children but they should keep in mind that children are not the only age group that visit. Besides it is so packed and flocked. The queues and waiting times are very long and lengthy. There's not much seating space with shade. The food and drinks in the disney are way too expensive. Not much choices for vegetarians. The Ocean Park is a very good alternative for Disneyland. You can choose Ocean Park over Disneyland on any given day and you surely wodon't regret it. Kids will surely love disneyland but not all age groups I am afraid. The evening lights in the park are very pretty. Hence we made a mistake and sacrificed a day which we could had utilized for a better purpose.",3
"I hate to give Disney a bad review but I have not been to Hong Kong Disneyland in about four years and I was a bit disappointed today. It was just not quite    on pointe    and lacked some of that    Disney Magic   . Small things were out of place... for example some of the lights not working and the rain chains not lying correctly in the rain forest scene in    it   s a small world   , a maintenance man fixing a gate that was not even being used (with all his tools on the ground in front of him) in the line of    Ironman Experience    while visitors were walking by to ride and the majority of the non performing cast members looking like they hated their jobs   no smiles.We were looking forward to seeing the new Moana show but the venue is absolutely ridiculous. Only three rows of seats in an area that could accommodate a lot more and not much shade cover so unless you got the seats, you had to stand in the hot sun for 20 minutes to watch. That made the entire show very unenjoyable and was a real downer. The kids hated it and said it was the worst part of their day. It   s seriously just seemed like Disney took the cheap route to create a new entertainment item.Also, we did not see it posted anywhere, not even on the Disneyland app, that they now close the rides in the back of the park one hour before closing time    We wasted time walking to the back of the park to ride some of those rides again and we would have changed our evening schedule had we known they would close early. We used to love riding the Mine Cars in the dark before the park closed.My sister was visiting us and is an avid Disney fan. She said,    No wonder no one comes to this Disneyland. The park is not open enough hours to get your money   s worth, they close some of the rides early and there is not a lot of shade cover compared to the other hot location, Walt Disney World in Florida.   I expect more from Disney. Thankfully, the new Light Parade is fantastic and so the day ended with that classic    Disney Magic   . ",3
"On the day of the visit there was adverse weather warning and many of the rides were closed for the day. Although kids had a great time, for me and wife it was tiresome walking all the day. The choice of restaurants is limited and the menu at each restaurant is very basic and bland. Overall it was a new experience. No one should miss Disneyland when visiting HK",3
Our day started off hot & sunny. Got there at 9.45am for 10am opening. Sure enough you get let in the front gate at 10am but that's it   you then have to wait until 10.30am to go further into park where rides are AND then they tell you that some areas inside dodon't open until 11am. So around lunch time the rain started and so there was no parade that day. We left after we did the minimal amount of rides.,3
It was extremely hot weather in June so avoid summer time.The place is small so it is manageable for family with young children.Go straight to Fantasyland if your kids are below 6 so you can go for most rides.The night parade was worth to watch but a bit disappointed that we diddon't get to see any Disney characters walking about for photo taking.Castle is also closed so no fireworks at night.,3
It was a bit disappointing as the Cinderella castle was under renovation and we didnt get to see the fireworks. The park was smaller than we had imagine it to be. Rides weredon't that many either. Good thing was that we went there during the non peak season so we do not really need to queue long for most of the rides. ,3
This is a great place to take your kids. If you have not been before it's worth checking it out one time. I woulddon't return as there are better alternatives like Ocean Park.,3
Good for day trip. But cant be compared with santosa island amusement options at Singapore . The best part was samba show and evening prade. Overall expensive and worth not visiting again.,3
"If you are an iron man fan, then you are in for a treat. As soon as you enter the park, Head for iron man experience, it   s the best ride of the park. Hyperspace mountain and grizzly gulch mine cars offer a good roller coaster experience. Indian food is not so good. Don   t forget to take water bottles with you, because they charge 3 times for mineral water. ",3
"This is Disneyland, a place for you and your children to meet Disney characters and feels some good but not too extreme rides. 2018 is my 2nd time to go here. Disneyland is constantly adding and renewing their attraction. However one main reasons to postpone your visit here (at least until late 2019) because the main castle is under renovation. The renovation also means that there are no fireworks show, which makes come to Disneyland is less worth these days. ",3
"I have been to Disneyland in LA, and thought all Disneyland's were identical. They are not, as obviously there can could be geographical constraints or economic restraints. If you havedon't been to any of the Disneyland's around the world and you are in HK, then come. If you have been to Disneyland in LA you will be disappointed ",3
"Smaller version of Disneyland California,enjoyed the similarities with a chinese taste,,loved the atmosphere ,the cast members go above and beyond with their every effort to ensure not jus your safety but also ensure an enjoyable time. Larger walking area ,with a train that has three stops, both spoken in English ,Chinese and mandarin. English speaking cast members certainly assisted us in our venture,we spent three days there ,really only one complaint was the amount of open umbrellas that some visitors had use of, they were open even in shops, and in the shade ,spent a lot of time trying to avoid losing an eye or two.",3
"I thought this is the happiest and coolest place on earth, I was wrong. There is limited numbers of rides to choose. they dodon't offer extreme rides unlike any other theme park. The castle is on going rehabilitation. The parade was good, but if you want and prefer to all rides you will not be satisfied to HK Disneyland.",3
It is the smallest Disneyland I have been. The train to the park is special but wasdon't very impressed. The whole place dodon't really have the  Disney  feel until we see the parade. Ticket is rather expensive for the whole experience.,3
"You cadon't give a bad review to a Disney park, but if you know the one in Paris u'll find this very disappointing because is too small and with very few atractions and poor shows. It have more food places than atractions. If you go in a easy day you dont have what to do in a whole day. The train for going there is nice because it has windows in a shape of Mickey and all kind of decorations. Overall its nice to spend a day if you dont have anything else to do, but not a must.",3
It was nice. Especially the Mickey   s philhar magic 3d show was outstanding. The forest river boat ride was very nice too. The fairy tale garden was a very unique concept. The tree house walk was also very attractive. The pooh and the lion king shows were nice too.. please remember that they give fast track time bound tickets free of cost at the attractions so that if you come at that particular time for that ride you do not have to wait in the long serpentine queues. But they do not mention it anywhere so be sure to ask their personnels standing outside the attractions. The train at the entrance of the park takes you through the park and you can get off at Fantasy land Area to explore the various attractions there. But there are huge lines for boarding this train so be prepared for waiting in long queues in this hot weather before you can board this train. Its a small world attraction is also very cute especially for young kids. There are some thrilling roller coaster rides too. The food banquet hall in the Fantasyland area has some good indian food and also has some nice veggie options. The afternoon and late evening carnivals are real fun to watch for kids and adults. If traveling here from hongkong or kowloon please use the Mtr as that is the mist convenient and fastest mode of transport to and from Disneyland,3
"I think this was my second time in a decade. I am a single guy in my 40s with no kids so not my usual place to hang out. I went this time as overseas friends were visiting amd they have a 3 year old.Because their child is so little, there were lots of rides we couldn   t do. Compared to other Disneys around the world, Hong Kong was always going to feel very small. But it suited me fine, no queues as it was a week day and I was beginning to get a bit bored and tired after 4 hours, but we had kind of gone around it once.Food is average but very expensive but expected. I had a good enough time and I think a lot of parents would also enjoy the fact that the place isn   t huge...",3
Not as good as the LA one but heaps to do for little kids and a few decent rides for older thrill seekers.,3
"Now I'm a huge fan of Disneyland in Anaheim, but it's hard to compare. HK Disneyland is much smaller and somehow lacks a little charisma like in California. Certainly worth an afternoon outing, but it could be better.",3
"Compared to Disney and other parks in USA this asian version of Disney is a small and modest park.Considering population and increasing wealth of the area, considering also the awakening of Chinese people for entertainment, I would think this should be the greatest park of the brand, or the greatest ever....Hope they have plans to explore this amazing market with outstanding attractions",3
"We've been to Tokyo Disneyland, Anaheim Disneyland and Disneyworld in Florida. This is the least of my favorite of all the Disneyland we have visited. And I can safely say, it's the same for my 8 year old son. HK Disneyland was just too small to be very crowded and unorganized when we went (Spring break 2018). Staffs were unfriendly except the older ones. Very few seem to want to go out of their way to help esp. those who did not speak the language. We were looking for a autograph album for my son and no one seem to either know nor care. Sad. It's also dirty. Lots of trash on the floor esp. the bathroom. People are just too uncaring here including the patrons. The lines for everything was just too long to really enjoy your day. Even to get something to eat or drink. I mean, the line was mostly long in all Disneyland we went to esp. in Disneyworld but HK Disney was the worst. Maybe the lines here just bothered us more probably because people around us was just not happy or friendly. Not at all the happiest place in HK!My 8 year old was initially excited to be here.... but on the second day, I diddon't even have to drag him out of the park. He was ready to leave by 4pm which I was not surprise at all. He was bored or a bit in a bad mood already towards the end. There was not a lot of Disney characters around and if there was, we diddon't really know nor did we find them because of the unorganized structure or program. The rides was okay. We saw Black Panther and Ironman which was the highlight of my son's day hence I gave this park a 3 stars instead of 2. Lastly, there is absolutely no grand finale here   yes, there's the electric parade but no fireworks (castle was under construction). I mean, you would think they can move it somewhere at least or arranged for something special for grand finale to make up for the lost fireworks... no effort here, really.... which is a surprise   this is Disneyland after all!! Is it? Overall, it was a miss for us... I'm not sure if we would come back here again if given another chance... At of the moment, this visit was pretty  eh ... We diddon't regret it all though because at least we can say we did went to HK Disneyland.",3
"Was in Disneyland Hong Kong with a group of 9 of which 5 were teens.The show which all of us liked was the Lion king show which was extremely well coordinated with various dance ballet forms incorporated along with fire show and trapeze with tableau. It was rich in color and vibrant in art.The other event all enjoyed was the grand parade at the end of the day.The disney chatacters were all displayed on tableau and the sights lights and sounds were simply superb.In between the two were a few rides and roller coasters thrown in which seemed regular to any amusement park.The park in itself was very visitor friendly with helpful staff, good signboards showing clear directions well maintained and clean. Toilets were very convenient and hygienically maintained.Wide choice of food and drink was easily availableOn the whole a good place to spend a day with your teen aged children",3
"I'm a bit disappointed with my Disneyland trip this year because the castle and Main Street train station were under construction, and they closed the Buzz Lightyear Astroblasters ride, which was so much fun (despite it conking out more often).",3
"HK Disneyland compared to others, it's rather small, and the admission fee is not cheap, it's good for young kids, but not for adults, for elderly that reached 65, can enjoy a discount price which is HK$100 for the admission fee. There is a park before the Dsineyland, and it's free and open to public. There is a Disneyland hotel, you can have buffet there, also can have accommodation there, but the price is rather expensive.",3
smaller in scale and less attractive than the ones in Japan and Europe. but it's still a good place to spend your Saturday or Sunday with your friends or families. i think they stopped the fireworks at night already,3
"Disneyland was extremely disappointing for us as our daughter is 11 and most rides suited 8 and under children, not much happens here and the atmosphere is pretty low key. The music that is played constantly throughout the park sends you a little insane after a while.",3
"For the tourists who have never been to the Disney at Paris or in the US, one can go here then! If you have been to those places, give this a miss! Not that great in comparison",3
"We keep on going to Disneyland hk. Both my kids live it (4 and 10 years old).The older one especially lives the iron man experience. It's really good. He also loves the toy story land where the rides are for slightly elder kids.Younger one, 4 year old girl, loves the fantasy land and all the Princess rides and stuff. She lives Winny the Pooh ride and the small world journey.The only complaint I have is that the food in all of the park is costly ( even for a theme park) and is not good at all.Their food standard has been abysmal for the last 7 years I have been going there. Having said that it's still an awesome place to go for experience.",3
"If you   ve been to Disneyland USA, this one won   t be too impressive. But it   s still fun for the kids.  Love the Night Parade.  Don   t visit during the summer months as it is crowded and extremely hot.",3
"I was  there yesterday.  I really liked  it and the parade was amazing, it was  clean, and at night the lights are pretty.",3
"Small version of Disney compared to FL and CA. Lines were short as were wait times which was a pleasant change. We were even able to ride the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars 3 times in a row because of the short lines. Also, the admission tickets are much cheaper than in FL or CA which was a plus.",3
We went early in the morning however it was probably the worst time to go. I would recommend going in the afternoon and if you   re ok to skip the parade then that   s the best time to go on the rides as there is little or no lines! Going in summer with kids is challenging but no matter they still enjoy it and it   s worth it for the young kids. ,3
"Visited this place on 10th April 2018. Unfortunately, Hong Kong Disneyland decided to undergo some major renovation to the main building photo op area, the Cinderella Castle, at this time. Can   t postpone our visit here coz we   ve already bought plane tickets & booked hotel room 3 months beforehand.Even on a weekday this place is terribly crowded. The lines for taking photo with Mickey & Minnie Mouse was ridiculously long. Spent more than an hour to do so causing us to not able to go for some of the rides by the end of the day.My advice is to go here sometime 2023 onwards when their last addition (some new Marvel themed attraction) is scheduled to open.",3
"After already being lucky enough to go to Disneyland in Paris, Orlando and Los Angeles I don   t think it was ever going to come close to them but felt I had to at least give it a chance while I was there. Park tickets were cheaper than the others I had been to but the experience didn   t compare to the others. Food and drink was pretty expensive too. A bottle of Coke worked out to   3.70 and an Ice Cream (Best part of the day) was   4.50. The castle was so small too which I think they have now realised as they are redoing it which is causing some distribution to the park with boards up all around it. I   m glad I went to say I have been but I don   t think I would be recommending it. ",3
"Not impressed, hardly any characters around, well organised and staff friendly, but not what we went for........",3
As seniors we were able to get into HK Disneyland for $17Australian. Although this is nowhere nears as big as other Disneyland it is still worthy a visit.,3
We coulddon't do the majority of the rides which was a shame as each ride had a minimum 50 to 60 minutes waiting time.,3
Hong Kong Disneyland as I think is the smallest Disneyland in the world. Its very crowd and everything need to queue for an hour. The price of annual pass is increasing but its better can go on weekday which not crowd as weekend. The games are nice but begin dirty now,3
"For hardcore fans, I don   t have to say anything, they will go no matter what I said. But for the other, a few tips: First, check if it is a long holiday in China such as labour day in May, national day in October or Lunar new year in around mid Jan to early Feb. The place will be all packed withChinese tourists.Second, IMO, please don   t go on a hot summer day (which is like mid May to early Oct) It is so so hot and humid. Imagine waiting in line with bunch of sweaty people all day.Well, that leaves us on Nov, Dec, March and April, which you get the best weather, less pack.Third, buy the fast pass even if you are going on the months I suggested. Without the fast pass, you and you group will basically wait in line pretty much all day probably only making 2 3 major ride.",3
"Hong Kong Disneyland is what you would expect from Disneyland worldwide   well decorated and several various theme parks. The hardware is there as it   s standardised globally   however on the soft services, I find it difficult to have rests in between rides (the wait for each of the rides could be as long as 30  minutes). Not that many vendor choices for quick rests. Number of washrooms are available but some require lengthy walks   so not the most convenient for children of younger ages. Majority of the resting seats in the parks are fully exposed under the sun without shades so it could be easily sunburned if visit the park without hats or umbrella. Majority of the F&B stops do not offer A C (but is open air) so it can be unbearable during heated summer time   do come prepared with light clothes and umbrella, hats, sunglasses and sunblocks. We already tried to beat the crowd by being the first to arrive the park, but more than a dozen tour groups arriving with large tour buses also planned the same and their stops are immediately in front of the park entrance whereas for private car park guests would need to walk further to arrive the entrance   just be mindful to wear very comfortable shoes as a lot of walking is required during the entire visit. ",3
"Having never been to Disneyland before I think I just expected it to be bigger and grander. I think if I was 5 years old then I would have thought it was amazing. It looks a bit aged but they are obviously doing work on things as Sleeping beauty   s castle and a few other things were all closed for renovations. It   s not cheap but not overly expensive either. The rides we did go on were great and the street parade was fun. We got there at 10am opening and had walked the park and were done by 1:30 and had ridden a few rides, there really isn   t that many. We went on a Monday so didn   t have the massive queues either. I think if we had gone when our kids were young we probably would have enjoyed it more it certainly is a place for small children. ",3
"Breezed through the gates but long lines at every show and ride. Staff were alert, attentive and professional. We enjoyed the rides, the shops and shows but not the crowd. The castle was under renovation too.",3
"Well, I'd say this Disneyland is better suited for kids. Perhaps young adults would find a few fun rides, but most aredon't very thrilling and more to a ~magical~ cruise swirls merrygoround type of rides.Food are certainly pricey but to be expected.Make sure to visit different souvenir stores inside as they sell somewhat different items at each area.Tip: DOdon't VISIT DURING PEAK SUMMER",3
Many places were closed for renovations. However the children enjoyed the new Ironman experience. Long waiting time for most photo shoots & rides. The park should impose a non smoking rule as the guests are mainly children.,3
"We   ve been at Disneyland Japan to compared it with, and obviously this was not as good. The queuing line to take pictures with Disney characters took almost 2 hours, way overprice meal and not too many options for attractions has made our visit shortened to couple of hours only.",3
Visited yesterday amidst great anticipation as our last visit was two years ago and we knew there were some new attractions as well as some old ones we wanted to revisit. Checked the website not much info. Reached there day started well at new Star Wars attraction and iron man show but soon discovered attractions like mystic point supposed to be brand new down Down due to technical error and Lion king show was also closed and toy story parachute ride was also closed. Mind you these are all star attractions! How can a park charge full admission when three star attractions are closed??!! This resulted in crazy queues by mid afternoon bec each ride show you can imagine should have been able to take a few hundred people off the track at each point!!! We left by 430 after the parade bec the crowd had gotten to the point of ridiculous. Sure people can fit into the park but with major rides closed this is not fair to paying customers flying in from overseas!!! A partial discount or meal vouchers should be offered when more than one major attraction is closed. Disappointed and unlikely to come back again.,3
"In all fairness, we went during Chinese New Year holiday.The Cinderella castle was closed for repairs.This one is considerably smaller in footprint & variety of activities.Diddon't seem they integrated the Chinese culture into the design & execution, it's very similar to the one in Orlando.Food offerings were good & diverse.Ticket price was reasonable.Very convenient transport, used MTR the whole way from Hong Kong island.Food stands take cash only",3
"For someone who is an avid Disney fan this park was disappointing. It   s too western and shows no oriental culture. They don   t even celebrate Mulan. The castle on mainstreet is miniature and laughable compared to Paris or Florida. Two small rollercoasters, no fast speed thrill chasers. There were no parades on and lots of things were closed for refurbishment. It lacked the Disney magic you feel in other parks. ",3
I last visited HK Disneyland 3 years ago and I already noticed the changes before. It was not as happy as before compare it 10 years ago when my wife and I visited. I missed the time we first visited where in people are all smiles and very helpful. That you can ask anybody anything about the park and they are all smiles and happy to help you. Disneyland HK has evolved into a commercialize theme park.,3
We went here late last year and I was a little disappointed when realising the park only really caters for young kids. My family and I are all above 16 years of ages and found we just got really bored instead of having fun.,3
"The usual over priced theme park experience, especially the food.   The queues are really long and not much fun to stand in on a scorching day with no shade.  There were about a hundred souvenir shops which were   you guessed it   over priced.",3
"We went from 4 8pm. Parade & fireworks were great. But I   ve heard the fireworks are no longer happening. Food prices reasonable by HK standards for dinner. Good time of day as not so hot, but I have an annual pass so just a few hours is feasible.",3
"Having been to a few disneys, the highlight for this one are the shows. The Lion King is excellent almost as good as the real show. It is not a big disney, but has many of the usual rides. The food though is extremely expensive and of poor quality. I would get into one early though as queues form early. We went early and had the place virtually to ourselves but it filled up later with queues everywhere. Worth a visit if you have not been to a disney.",3
"Went during the CNY period (20 Feb 2018). Over corwded with tourist (which is fine and understandable), alot of rude tourist who like to cut queue. Hope Disneyland management can pay attention to this and disallow such rude and uncivilize action.",3
"It may have not been a good year (or probably month) to visit because they're renovating the place and there are lots of attractions that are closed when we were there 2 weeks ago. They also hiked up the ticket price starting January 2018.During our stay, 2 of the attractions that we went to malfunctioned so they had to close it for about an hour or so. Picture taking with Mickey & Minnie also have specific timings and they cut it short very early (around 4:00 or 4:30 PM). I could be wrong but I dodon't remember them closing it before 4PM on my previous visits few years ago.Dodon't get me wrong.... Disneyland is still a very fun place to visit in Hong Kong. Parade of the Stars is still one of my favorite events there. Always fun to see the Disney characters. I would still recommend to visit it specially if you have children who loves to go to theme parks.",3
"It's a good activity to do with the family but is small, very small. We took the train there early morning to avoid the latecomers and we pretty much went on all the rides by noon. We were lucky enough to not have to wait in line for longer than 30 mins but were told that the queue can get up to 2 hours per ride. I would recommend visiting if traveling with children but would avoid if travelling with teens, there are way better things to do in HK. ",3
"Went during cold spell in Hong Kong, difficult to keep warm in long queues, despite coats and scarves!Several rides areas closed, not as speedy getting people on and off so waits long. Smaller than Orlando but most elements there.Disney train with its Micky mouse window great fun.",3
"While it is a disney, still it pales by comparison to the other disneys in paris and usa. So i feel its not worth a special trip. But if you there with spare time it could be worth it.",3
Hongkong Disneyland is the smallest Disneyland i have ever been. The overview of the theme park is for children and girls. But for men playthings is not any funny at all except on or two of them in the place. For me only grizzly mountain and space mountain was better than i has expected.,3
"My daughter and I visited Hong Kong Disneyland yesterday and were less than impressed. The park is beyond the smallest we have been to. And the castle was blocked off, which was not advertised anywhere. Such a let down. We finished the park in less than 5 hours, which included an hour wait to see Minnie and Mickey. Kids there are extremely rude and pushy, constantly cutting in line, and the parents don   t seem to care at all. I ended up yelling at a few and blocking them from cutting. The food is by far the most expensive out of the 3 Asian disney parks, and the worst. PhotoPass   NOT worth the money. All other parks had photopass photographers throughout the park. The ONLY ones this park has are with characters. So unless you want to wait in line all day for 2 3 photos per character, don   t waste your money. They will also take photos with your camera or phone for you. ",3
"My family and I purposely chose weekdays to avoid large crowd. To our surprise, it was not as what we expected. Queue for rides, photo taking, food and all (too much to mention) are too long.. just to take a pic with a character will takes almost 30mins.. furthermore there are limited character stationed and no character roaming around to ease the  photo booth  congestion.. staff there are not polite.. the tone of voice and expression are also not welcoming.. THEY FORGET THAT WE ARE THEIR CUSTOMER AND THEY ARE THE SERVICE PROVIDER!",3
"Not a very big park but will suffice if there is time to go for a visit. Heard that starting 2018 there will be no more fire works during night time. Always a good place for children and as usual in every park, waiting time for ride might takes a long time.",3
"Was it worth the visit...? I   m not so sure...We arrived for 10am thinking we   d get a bite to eat before heading off around the park. That just wasn   t to happen until much later as there were virtually no dining places open, in fact some didn   t open until noon & some didn   t open at all. The park is TINY. I couldn   t believe how quickly we got around it, possibly due to the fact that a few attractions were closed (Castle, Buzz, Train etc), so we were done in no time at all.  60 was definitely a big price to pay for the disappointing experience.",3
"Criticising any Disneyland is not fair thing because it   s any kid   s paradise but Don   t expect much from this Disneyland for older or overactive kids. It is comparatively small park. We went on rainy cloudy weekday & still long queues.If one day is not enough then possibly only because of queue has wasted your time.I have 2 young boys 5 yo & 2 yo. Lot attractions are more for girls and then boys    attractions were jammed pack with over 60 mins queues.So I must say if you have daughter then dress her to princess & she will love this castle.By 4 pm, we realised we have to split with 2 kids to complete this.So I took 2 year old in train elephant ride horse carousel & few other kiddies rides.He enjoyed lot.These was age appropriate but then why would you go to Disneyland for those rides for almost $90Aud? 5 yo couldn   t go in star war miles from tomorrow land & few water rides only because of endless queues.You have to miss one or other for older kids.We have been to movie world sea world & dream world in Goldcoast, AUS & paid lesser for 3 theme parks then HK Disneyland.Also food was expensive inside.Overall, Perfect for girls for sure.My 5 year old said, movie world was better then this.",3
"Transport is very convenient as you can take the MTR and a reasonable price, drive or take a taxi. The price of the tickets are a bit high but if you are planning on having fun all day long there I would say it   s worth it. The food is not that pleasant but the rides are fun, especially the run away mine carts and space mountain.",3
"I was expecting something similar to the Disneyland in Tokyo or California, but the Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely a bit smaller and for younger kids. It   s not as magical as the others, and the food selection isn   t great (especially for my three year olds nieces) ",3
"In terms of fun factor, Singapore's Universal Studios was way better.The Disney Princesses seemed unhappy while touring the grounds and being ogled by children and people.The Night Parade was a let down. At the end of it we were asking if that was it. After lining up and being jostled around by the crowd we felt shortchanged.Staff at the souvenir shops were snooty   so why would people be happy in buying way overpriced Disney stuff we could get at lower prices elsewhere?There was no ride that I could say was super fun. And I was so looking forward to the Star Wars ride which was not fun at all   is that all they could think of?Maybe we'll have a better experience in Osaka with the Harry Potter theme park...",3
First time to any Disney Park. Was expecting it to be magical but we found the place somewhat muted.Maybe it was the crowd. We even saw a kid peeing at the sidewalk. It wasn   t as crowded as we thought but it may be even worse during peak season.Food was horrendous. Keep bumping into the smoking corners as well. ,3
"Having never been to Disneyland we were excited to go during our stop over in Hong Kong.Not sure why they stagger the times that areas open but we had to wait to get into each area which was annoying. Some of the attractions were not open the day we went which was disappointing.Can   t say it was all that exciting, the rides were pretty average and nothing thrilled us. The lines are long but the wait isn   t bad considering some of the rides last for less than 2 minutes!Plenty of food options and lots of souvenir shops.This felt like the budget option, I   m sure the real Disneyland is much more impressive.",3
Spend half a day at Disneyland. Queued for an hour plus to take photos with characters such as Mickey and Donald.The rides were not as exciting as the ones in Tokyo and Paris. Food there was average too. Sadly there is no light shows   fireworks anymore. But still a nice experience for those who never been to Disneyland before,3
"Was here over the NYE break on a weekday. Diddon't have any high expectations but in the end it was still not super exciting for our 2.5 year old. We managed to do all the rides he was allowed to go on within 1.5 hours..by then the lines were already very long. Once we had lunch, the queues were up to an hour for silly rides like DUMBO the elephant (going round in circles??). The fastpass system they have is not for every ride and not the most convenient. It would be great if you could buy a priority pass like in Ocean Park.We did manage to watch the Festival of Light show (basically a 25min condensed version of the Lion King) which I thought was really good. I suppose unless your kids or you yourself are a huge Disney fan, Disneyland will not be much of a big deal. We went to Ocean Park a few days later and found it was much better value both for kids and adults....10 times bigger and with heaps more things to do.",3
Went only because we needed to go somewhere to kill tin till our flight that night. Neither of us even like rides. We diddon't get there till after 1700. There was hardly any queuing. We decided to try out the rollercoaster. Diddon't realise it went backwards. Whilst everyone else were hands in the air me and the Mr were screaming our heads of. Was fun but never again.Also did some sort of boat ride. Never saw any characters maybe once it got dark they dodon't come out.Personally I dodon't think it's worth the hefty price even if you go on all the rides. Thought the Disney train was quite cool though,3
"I went just to fill in a day and to compare it to the USA Disney   s and of course it does not at all compare. The waiting times for rides were nothing less the 50 minutes and that was for the less popular rides. I would hate to be a parent trying to explain this to a child. The food was reasonably priced and transportation to get there easy. I only went to look around, and enjoyed what I saw. But if you were really wanting to go on the rides make sure you organise your fast passes before you go.",3
"Easy to get too, well organized, it was winter and school was in so not many patrons and no long queues. Though this I feel diminished the experience. Not great food options, very expensive   pack drinks and snacks.....",3
"We booked the tickets online, thus avoid the queue at the entrance. The entrance fees and eateries inside the theme park were rather expensive. Rides were ok. It was quite crowded and some rides we had to wait for about 30 minutes. This is not the first time we were here, thus got a bit bored after a while. We do stay till the end as we wanted to watch the fireworks.",3
"I've been to the Disneyland in Florida and Tokyo and I've to say that the Disneyland in Hong Kong is small compared to them. I was kind of disappointed when I saw the castle. The rides were not as exciting as the ones in Tokyo and Florida too. Although the Disneyland in Hong Kong is smaller than the ones I visited, there were way too many tourists and it was impossible to take all the rides. As such, I missed out on some exciting rides. The queue average waiting time is about an hour or so. You can opt for FastPass at some of the attractions such as the Hyperspace Mountain and the Iron Man ride. The Disneyland also closes at 8.30pm. However the fireworks displays begin at 9pm. Food is expensive. It's about HKD100. It is an overpriced pleasure, but its still magical!",3
"Visited the park with my family on Wednesday. Tickets cost HK$619. IMO the park tickets are very expensive. The park is not very huge. Hence a 1 day ticket is sufficient unless you are staying in one of the resort hotels. Not many adult rides. Majority are kids friendly rides. For more adult rides, suggest to go Ocean Park instead. It   s also cheaper. Some of rides can queue for approx 30 45 mins.Food wise, There are a variety food offerings in the park from chinese to western meals. Set meal with a main course and soft drink will set you back approximately HK$100 150.We stayed there for the fireworks. It   s the last few shows before they shutdown the fireworks for a long period of renovation. The show was spectacular. Unfortunately they don   t offer it already. At the Main Street, there were even man made snow. Nice attempt to bring the Christmas mood.",3
"If you have seen Disneyland overseas then you don   t need to see it here, it   s expensive and targeted at children.",3
toilets were horrifying. crowd was madness. the christmas tree blocking fireworks. shops were in a huge mess. i think some tourist really spoil the park.,3
Second time to Disneyland HongKong. Not much change except additional themes and rides.   Overall still enjoyable experience especially for kids.   Night parade more extravagant than afternoon one,3
"Having been to many amusement parks around the world, this is probably one of the less exciting ones for young adult travelers though there are plenty of offers for kids.   One day pass was definitely enough!",3
I visited Disney Land Hong Kong last year while on a 2 day trip. Overall it was okay and would be very exciting for kids or someone who had never been to a Disney Land before. I have been to others previously and found Hong Kong to be the smallest of them with only a few real adult rides. Space Mountain was by far the best of these. The evening fireworks were great as always and staff fantastic. Could do the park in half a day if required. We arrived at 11am and had seen it all by 3pm but hung around for the Parade. Lots of queues but not bad by Disney Land standards,3
"In essence, if you come after 11 am, you will only find a huge ultra loud Disney Hollywood themed upsell heaven, a huge outdoor mall with expensive toys and food, and occasional rides with 45 90 minute wait times. You will also find that some attractions with long queues are just walk through  art  displays or talking cartoon characters   a ridiculous waste of time, if you ask me. So, if it's rides you're after, the main thing is to come early, just when the doors open at 9:30. You will then enjoy all the rides within some 90 minutes and then spend the rest of your time as you please. If you cadon't, do buy the fast pass, you'll be helpless and very dissatisfied without it. Another worthy option is to book a stay at one of the three hotels around the park: they offer an extra admission hour from 8:30 to 9:30 in the morning plus 1 fast pass on any ride for all guests, and that helps a lot. You dodon't have to book direct or at HK DL site, booking.com and other aggregators may offer better deals.Prices are another pain point. Dining is quite expensive, either in the park or in hotels. You do want to consider the dining coupons offered on HK DL website, as well as ticket hotel combos and other offers; they make sense. The offers and prices there and at klook.com are the cheapest (and identical), but at Klook you can collect points and save at other HK attractions (you can save 25 HKD off your first order with code WK7A9 then explore more coupons at picodi.com). Alternatively, do bring your own snacks and drinks.If you can still feel your feet at the end of your DL experience, exit the park and walk right of the whale sculpture. You'll enjoy a beautiful and almost empty (yet also plagued with loud music) passage to the pier and hotel gardens, and a great seaside view. First hotel to your right has a great bush maze, children love it. Afterwards you can exit through the hotel and take a free shuttle bus to the train station.",3
"We had a lovely day here, but certainly did not need a second day (Gold Coast theme parks have just as much, if not more to offer). We enjoyed the Jungle river boat ride and the treehouse. We skipped the little kids section, as we were travelling with a 12 y o. The food, like most theme parks was expensive and deep fried. The Disney characters were great, but long lines for a photo. The transport system out the front is exceptional and the surrounding areas are immaculate!",3
"Since noon time 12 I reach to front door Disney land , until 6 pm , I only can visit 5 game stations , it is really big land and long queuing for many places , the food choice only fast food inside , expensive but not good taste , near by main door the chineses resteraunt must wait 1 hour to get seat , next time I will bring own water and sandwich carry to there , the most game I like is iron man , and mystery house among the games that I play ; they close at 9 , if you bring you kids go there better prepare some water and snacks also going to there a bit ealier morning . ",3
"A good Family Fun day out to be had here. It is very small compared to the Anaheim Disney Land which I have been to several times. However this is still a good one to visit. The lines weredon't that long for the rides attractions. But be prepared to pay a lot of money for food and drinks, as you always do at these types of attractionsOverall little kids and big kids will have fun",3
"less than my expectation, especially the fireworks highlight of the day. the rest was okayed. one more thing they need to use more english for their show.",3
Lot of lovely stuff there. Foods are quite expensive . The visitors should plan very well to join all interesting things with in one day,3
"Got bored after a few hours. Only ride that was good was the ironman show. And, well, probably some of the live action shows. Other than that, place is too crowded and meant to appeal to children, not adults",3
"They have starwars merchandises everywhere and sadly I am not a fan of starwars but rides are fun and queue was not that bad (30min   ) on Saturday afternoon.   People going during winter, do stay for the xmas tree light up at 6.15pm!",3
I went because my wife wanted to go... I love roller coasters and thrill rides. This park was tiny and had none of that.,3
"There are limited rides compared to the one in Japan. The park is small and crowded. However, most queues are relatively short if you go on a weekday. Expect to wait about 20mins. If you had never been to Disneyland, then this will be a good one to start.",3
"It   s Disneyland so is worth a visit, however you need to note the park is quite small.Having visited LA, Florida and Paris, thought I would visit HK Disney whilst in the city. Lots of great Disney touches such as the train you take to the park. I arrived at opening so the ride times were almost instant for the first couple of hours. I spent 6 hours in the park and was surprised that I had completed most of it. It is certainly a lot smaller than its counterparts that I had previously visited.Obviously great for families and Disney fans. Glad I   ve done it but probably wouldn   t go again in the future. ",3
It maybe good for the first timers and kids. I think the park is too small and the rides were limited.,3
"Added new rides and experiences like Ironman, but took away some really children friendly rides like the Buzz Lightyear. The musicals and live shows are really good, though.The bad part was the photographer for those character photo session was not too friendly, required an autograph book or any writing material from Disney even though Cinderalla was willing to sign it. Overall not really friendly for kids below 7 years old as the queue is too long for those rides suitable for them and price is insanely expensive for food and rides.",3
"Visiting in the mid of June 2017, I entered the park after the weather forecast said that typhoon might hit that day. It was still 30 minutes from the park's opening time, yet it had been overcrowded, mostly by tourists from the mainland China.At 10 a.m. the gate was opened, but visitors were allowed to enter only the Main Street USA. I had to wait for another 30 minutes to get access to the whole park, only to find that all outdoor rides halted, due to the bad weather. But the weather was not totally bad, it was just intermittent light rain. Even the Mad Hatter Tea Cups, which has got roof over it, was never in operation the whole day. The halt of all outdoor rides had caused all visitors to pack into the indoor ones. Looking at almost all indoor rides having a very long line, I started to feel down. Most of the food outlets were closed. After walking around for some time, finally we came across one. We tried the food (fried rice), but the taste was just far from yummy. At 4 p.m., all visitors were told to leave the park as it was thought that the weather would get worse. The visitors that day were given a free entry to the park within one year for free. However, since I was in Hong Kong for a one week vacation, I could never come back there. I realize weather is beyond control; however, given the ticket price I paid, what I got in it (I diddon't get a lot) was not worth it.",3
"We went on a rainy day in November. Despite this, it was still super busy! My 4 year old was a bit hesitant to go on some rides. It is a smaller Disneyland and can easily be done in 1 day. The food is a total rip off. we ate at the royal banquet. The entry is expensive, but we felt it was an experience we wanted to give our kids. The Disneyland themed train is fun too!",3
If you have visited Adlabs Imagica avoid it at all cost. Go between Tue   Thu for less crowd. Reach around 1pm and get on the rides as people are busy having lunch until 2pm. You would be done by 6:30pm. Stay around for the fireworks and leave a bit early to avoid rush as all exit at once. Travel by MTR is quick and easy.,3
"I've been to Disneyland in California, Orlando and Japan   out of the 4 this is worse one that I've been too. It's quite small compared to the other parks and the rides are just average. Only ride I really liked was Mystic Manor which I would highly recommend if you are going. Food was just average as well. People are also quite rude, had a couple incidents of grown adults running past us (with a 3 and 5 year old) pushing us to get to a ride. Not Disney's fault of course but doesdon't lend to a pleasant experience. Also the train ride to the park is very long and quite crowded even in the Disney only designated train   I think they should consider running more trains. Glad to say I've visited but wodon't be returning to this park when we visit HK next.",3
"An interesting twist on the traditional Anaheim location. Only 16 rides in total and geared towards children. Due to the relationship the Chinese have with their ancestors, some rides were revised or do not exist. The haunted mansion is the Mystic Manor and the only ride we went on twice. An enjoyable experience. There is no Pirates of the Caribbean as well. Tomorrowland is Star Wars and Marvel centric, which was not a bad thing. We spent a half day which was more than enough to ride everything and see the sites. We also went on a Saturday afternoon starting at around lunch and we pretty much walked onto the rides without wait. It started to get busier around 5pm. A worthy stop on the way back from Big Buddha if Disney is your thing.",3
"Hong Kong Disney is a small scale Disneyland for anyone who has been to the LA or Florida versions. Plenty to do for young kids (up to age 7 8 yrs), but for older kids or adults, you will get bored quickly. Only 3 4 good rides for this one   Hyperspace Mountain (faster and more impressive than its cousin Space Mountain), Grizzley Gulch railroad ride (again faster and more variation than Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in LA), Ironman ride (comparable to Space Tours in LA) and the Mystic Manor (  Haunted House in LA). We went for the day but were done by around 3.30pm. Good for a stop over visit if you have some time to kill on a layover from the airport (it is very nearby), but expensive ($587 HK   1 day)unless you have young kids to get value for money.",3
"If you are wondering whether or not to spend a day at Disney Hong Kong, it all comes down to for you are looking for.  How much do you like thrill rides?Disney HK is quite tame on that regards, with Grizzly Gulch and Space Mountain being the most ''extreme'' rides, the latter being already a slower version of the attraction.   What's the age group?Due to the above comment, a younger audience might be more appreciative.A high energy group looking for some round the clock fun would probably be disappointed by Disney HK.   Would you go mainly for the rides or for soaking up the  Disney feel ?As it's been pointed out by many reviewers, the number of attractions isdon't huge and many are not rides. Some visitors come to mainly walk around and enjoy the scene. In a nutshell, if you're looking for a day packed with numerous attractions and thrill rides, HK Disney wodon't probably cut it and Ocean Park might be a better option.",3
The weather is fine but still very hot in November.I took the MTR train from Central to Sunny Bay then changed line to Disneyland. The travelling time was about 30 minutes.Got a copy of the programme and went to see the shows at the designated time. Went to the different zones one by one. There were four different zones altogether.Must see the parade near the Main Street at about noon.The fireworks display at night was fascinating.Eating inside the park was expensive but there were a lot of choices from Chinese food to other Asian foods.It was a fun day for the kids from 10am till 10pm.,3
"Average for Disneyland, plenty of rides missing that you would expect if you've been to LA.   But  It's a Small World  is here, joyful congregation and all.",3
Lovely Disney site easily accessible but a very small site but nice for a one day visit .. helpful staff visited on a Saturday not to busy so waits on rides minimal which was lovely .,3
"I went to Disneyland to ride in the Teacups, but they were undergoing renovation   so the sign said. Many of the restaurants were closed. The Fantasy Garden where you can usually have photos taken with all the characters was also closed. The sign said Mickey and Friends would be at The Main Street entrance for photos. Later in the day when we tried to join the line at the Main Street entrance for photos with Mickey we were told that there were enough people already so we were turned away. The line was not extensive or long by an means. The Omnibus Street vehicle was out of service. When we went to Disney's Storybook Theatre to see the 4.30 Mickey Show there was an employee holding a sign saying this show is full. I think that if you are paying $100AUD you should expect that EVERY attraction would be open and operational.A tip   buy your ticket online from the Disneyland website. You will not have to line up at the ticket booth and you will save some time. If you are a visitor to Hong Kong you will also receive a $50HK shopping voucher.",3
"If you have a stop over and it is on a public holiday DO NOT waste your time and money going to Disneyland. The park overall is nice but the sheer amount of people is concerning to say the least! Getting in at the main gate will take you 1hour plus. If you are not used to the disregard chinese folks have for standing in a line, the experience will just get worse for you! Again avoid going to Disneyland on a public holiday. We were only able to ride 4 rides for a whole day because of the lines being extremely long! Tip when it comes to the jungle boat ride take the line that says english guide, you will not have to wait that long for a boat, chinese line will take you forever! Did like the parade!",3
"My 4 grandchildren who had no experience of the LA and Orlando Disney had relative fun spending a whole day in the HK Disney. They .spent most of their time in the rides since Disney characters were wanting to seek autographs from and pose for pictures. They were only able to get Mickey and Minnie's autographs and pictures after a sweltering 2 hour queue, Chip and Dale and a picture with Goofy who luckily was roaming the Main Street. As a Halloween treat, there were two (2) short parades added: Mickey's Halloween Time Street Party and Villains Night Out! Chapter Two. However, these coulddon't compare with the pomp and glamour in the parades at LA, more so at Orlando. The place was small, the rides and the fireworks even, leave much to be desired too. At any rate, since my grandchildren did not have anything to compare their experience with, they were moderately contented, clamoring for more rides hopefully in the future.",3
"It was school holidays, my brother lives in Hong Kong, and I had a 9 year old that wanted to go to DisneyLand.We had a couple of days visiting my brother, and then 2 days at the Park, overnighting at the Disney Explorer's Lodge. One advantage of the Lodge is that they have a shuttle bus to and from the Park, running every 15 minutes or so. That saved time (and money) getting to and from the Park.Firstly, I was surprised at how small Disneyland was, especially compared with what I remembered of my first (and last) visit to Disneyland in Anaheim in 1985! After getting through the turnstyles, we jumped on the Disneyland train that took us around the perimeter and deposited us at the back end of Fantasyland. It was quite quiet (we arrived around 2pm) and access to the rides was not lengthy. We jumped on Dumbo, which was suitable for small kids, and then went to Mickey's Phiharmajic. That was really great, a 3D movie themed around the Mickey Mouse song, played by an animated orchestra. Featuring Donald Duck (not Trump) as the conductor. At the end of the performance Donald went flying through the air and ended up going through the back wall!We wandered across to the Mad Hatter Tea Cup and spun ourselves silly, and then had a rest and an ice cream. We caught up with some friends around 4pm, and went straight to the Iron Man show. This one was a 4D movie, and was well worth the entry fee. We were in a type of flying fighting machine, which rocked and rolled, and was based in Stark Tower, nominally in Hong Kong. A great way of seeing the skyline, being destroyed by some  bad guys . We then wandered off to Adventureland, which was the highlight, especially the Grizzly Gulch roller coaster. Cadon't give too much away because I dodon't want to spoil the fun for others, but it was great. Dusk was falling, which added to the ambience when we went on the Jungle River Cruise. Fake crocs, elephants, hippos, and natives made a lot of noise, and it was quite eery.We ended the day with dinner in the Corner Cafe, where our little girls had some spaghetti, and the men had a pair of Rueben sandwiches. Surprisingly good. Which brings me to the disappointing part of Disneyland. As said at the start, as a themed, fun park, carrying the Disney name, I would have thought it would be better. However, the main emphasis seems to be selling: average and expensive food, and poor quality Disney products. Clothes, dolls, stuffed animals, and other Disney memorabilia. It became a bit much where around every corner there was a food shop, or a retail store. In fact Main Street had one side of it filled with retail. I was fortunate that my daughter was well disciplined, and we only ended up was an umbrella, and a Mickey Spatula, to assist with her baking! Not so lucky were a lot of other parents who were weighed down with lots of  stuff .Overall, the theme park was good, and the nightly fireworks were great. However, it all paled into insignificance compared to the retail and the food.",3
"Ever since we visited the park in Los Angeles, my daughter was keen to visit the one again and we decided to take her to Hong Kong. We were extremely enthusiastic about this place and bought 2 days ticket but we couldnt even spend one full day here. This place is nowhere close to the one in US and is extremely commercial. What I mean by commercial is that the focus is more on shops rather than characters and their house, the disney experience etc. The entrance is designed similar to the one in Los Angeles. There are some rides but those are not the one that one goes to disneyland for. There is a toy train that gives a good ride across the park. However, if you are expecting to meet all the characters then you would surely be disappointed as there are only mickey and mini and they also stand in a shaded area rather than having a home of their own. Plus there arent other characters and princess castle etc. There is a food court and some eateries inside and you can also buy waterbottles etc. so dont worry about carrying food, drinks etc. In summary, what you get is all the toys  figurines etc but the place fails to offer the disney experience. Maybe Disney undermined the tourism potential of Asia and developed a very small park that focuses more on shops rather than Disney experience. After some time it felt as if we are in Disney mall rather than Disneyland. If you havent been to any disneyland then its a fine place to go to. However, if you want a real disney experience, I would suggest visiting the one the Los Angeles (if and when you plan a trip to US). You can separately view my review of the the Disneyland in US.Overall, I was indeed disappointed and its possible that this disappointment was because of my prior visit to the one in US. If you plan to visit, please do keep maximum of a day for it and do carry umbrellas (as it gets really hot in summer) and a camera.",3
"Disney aficionados will of course need to see this. It feels smaller than the CA Magic kingdom but the walking areas are wide like Orlando and the number of attractions are scaled back. Check out the Mystic Manor   different than the Haunted Mansion and well done. Iron Man attraction is a simulator ride that is fine. Small World and Winnie the Pooh are exceptionally well done with vibrant colors that really pop when you see them   US Disney needs to refurbish! Ticket price, given the scaled back attractions, wasdon't too bad.",3
"I wish I could give 3 1 2 stars because that would be more accurate. However, this is a hard review because there are some positives, but there are some big negatives to Hong Kong Disney.POSITIVESWait Times   If you go during the week and get there when the park opens (generally at 10:30 AM), you will have 10 minute waits or less for the first couple of hours in the park. We went on a Monday in October and waited 5 10 minutes for all the major rides until around 1:30 2:00 when the park started to get more crowded. Even then, our longest wait was 30 minutes which would be considered short wait times by Orlando standards.Unique Rides   Big Grizzley Mountain is a superb ride that combines the best of Expedition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain. There are two great surprises on this ride that make it stand out as one of the best coasters Disney has assembled. HyperSpace Mountain combines a Star Wars theme to its classic ride to make it more exciting the original. And the new Iron Man ride is outstanding as well. Lastly, Mystic Manor takes the trackless innovation of Tokyo Disney's Winnie the Pooh and creates a Haunted Mansion experience that's truly one of the best.Shows   There are some terrific shows at the park, namely: Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. Great music, costuming and special effects.NEGATIVESSize   Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely small which means you can pretty much do all the attractions in a single day. We choose to ride our favorite rides 2 3 times and we still rode 80% of the rides at the park.Cast Members   I cadon't even believe I'm saying this about a Disney property, but the Cast Members were lacking...by a lot! Rarely did we receive a smile. No Disney cheerfulness. No excitement whatsoever in any cast member we saw. It makes you realize how much of the Disney experience is wrapped up in the attitude of their cast members because it soured our taste of this park.Line Cutting   People must have cut in line on us a dozen times or more. It seemed accepted and even the cast members looked the other way (figuratively   because most were looking right at them and diddon't do a thing). Again, this really took away from the experience. Nothing about the atmosphere at HK Disney seemed  Disney esque There are other minor items on both sides, but these are the major points of interest. Having been to 9 Disney parks around the world, this would definitely be at the bottom of the list.That being said, if you want to go and ride some terrific rides at a park that is not terribly crowded most of the time, then I would encourage you to go. Quite honestly, the little kids probably wodon't even notice. But the adults, they will notice that this park does not have the Disney mystique.",3
"We love Disney parks but this one lacks so much appeal compared to USA parks. There is no atmosphere in the park, in parts it was like a deserted ghost town. It is smaller compared to the others which is not a problem but its just lacking in so many ways. The staff are not as friendly either.Some good rides there like your usual space mountain, buzz lightyear etc. Food and drinks are really expensive so be prepared. As a family we never had to really que for anything which was great. Sadly we did not see the parade as a huge storm came over the park. This did not detract from our day as we have seen parades before. Cadon't quite put my finger on it but we all agreed the park was missing the Disney sparkle.",3
"We had a great day out with my young children at Disney, there are lots of fun rides suitable for all ages and plenty of entertainment that you'd expect such as parade and bands playing music. The choice of food at restaurants is average but do try the mickey waffle with cream in his ears!!The worst bit for us was character meeting where the staff believe they are entitled to talk and behave with customers the way they like. We had first hand account of a couple begging to meet a character but they were turned down even though they'd come from abroad since they were five minutes late. We ourselves wanted to take our children to meet Donald but were slightly late since my wife stopped to help an elderly couple. I totally understand that being late is not an excuse and am not even arguing about it but the way the lady behaved and talked to us is at best appalling. We dodon't speak Chinese and she then started joking about us with other customers and they were all laughing. My family was very upset at this so I went to the guest relations team to lodge a formal complaint. The guy there took details of the incident on a small piece of paper and did not ask for my name contact. When I asked how they would send me feedback he said they dodon't but that he would raise it with the department of the employee concerned.",3
The place is beautiful . All the rides are very good but have very long queues.It may take more than one hour per ride. However the place is very nice. The train takes you from starting to Fantasyland. The castles at Fairy land are a major attraction for kids..The Toystory land and tomorrowland are the best.,3
"We were traveling to Hong Kong with our children and knew we needed to do a day at Hong Kong Disneyland. The park is rather small so a day is plenty of time. The lines to the rides were 10 minutes or less and the crowds were not overwhelming. Drawbacks, although it was Disney, I felt like it was Disney at 50% effort. It was Halloween and I have been to many other parks at this time and the decorations are amazing. Hong Kong Disney had Halloween decor up, but it seemed to be the leftovers from the other parks. It was not the same feeling you get in LA, or Orlando. I am glad we went, but definitely ok with going one time in my life. Side note, the weather was miserable. Hot an Humid, but really short lines, so it can be viewed as a win!",3
"Compared to other Disneyland this is just a small portion compacted altogether what they have..It was my treat vacation for my mom and my girls...my son diddon't come with us this trip :( anyhow, we did enjoy coz it's my mom's first HK trip.. Given, it's expensive but worth a try for a1st timer.. My suggestions specially during summer:  bring umbrella and your camera phone  bring a lot of water (expensive inside)  wear rubber shoes and comfortable clothings  bring face towel tissues wet & dry  try all the rides as much as you can  be a child again enjoy the ridesAnyway, my mom's 73 but still strong and healthy... she enjoyed that moment ",3
"Most of the attractions are the same as the ones in Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, with the exception of Toy Story Land.They have changed some of the great attractions im Tomorrowland which I feel is a big mistake. Autopia (also known as Tomorrowland Speedway) has been shut completely and I remember there was a roller coaster ride which is also gone. However, they've replaced it with Buzz Lightyear Space Mission, which is fun   its a 1v1 laser shooting game where to hit targets to gain points. I remember I was so good at it I scored over a million points (max level) HAHA.Space Mountain ride is a must go!!! It's the same as the one in Disney World!!! Loads of fast corners and humps!!!The rest is pretty much the same so nothing much to talk about.The only thing good is with the opening of Shanghai Disneyland, you will hardly see any Mainland Chinese tourists in Hk Disneyland. So no more long queues and queue cutting.They do have the fast pass system but it's only for like 3 attractions (not the rides) so dodon't even use it   it's pointless.",3
"Hong Kong Disney has limited rides and attractions and seems much more geared towards younger kids. It poured with rain the day we went so quite a few of the attractions were temporarily closed. The park lacks the Disney atmosphere that I've experienced at other parks. On the up side, it's very easy to get there by MTR. ",3
"If you are a Disney fanatic, this is good for the Disney aspect. There are a few good rides, but compared to any American six flags the ride selection and quality are inferior. Younger kids would still have a great time. It   s smaller than American theme parks. I do not recommend the meal voucher. A lot of places don   t accept it",3
Bit of a disappointment really as is tiny ..gives an idea of Disneyland ..but only as far as people movement etc. Good for rides ..queues of course but wait time is not long.,3
"If you've been to the original Disneyland you may be a little disappointed with this one as it is only a quarter of the size. However it still has the quintessential happy Disney vibe about it. Worth a visit as it still puts a smile on your face. Make sure you dodon't miss the Lion King show. It is brilliantly done with props and big strong voices. If arriving by train, you will love Disney's own carriages, it is a fun way to arrive and kick start your day ",3
"Maybe September is not a big month for Disney Hong Kong or maybe it was the weather, but several rides were not open. Our biggest disappointment was that Buzz Lightyear had closed the previous weekend forever. It will be rebranded as part of a new theme being developed in that area. The line at Buzz was always not too long (like Orlando) so we would ride it over and over again. I guess we're stuck with trying to get fast passes in Orlando in the future.The Lion King was very good with some changes improvements from the last time we visited. The only bad part is the wait to get in.Hong Kong Disney size wise is nothing like Orlando so if that is what you are expecting you will be disappointed greatly. It is worth at least one visit (we've been 3 times) just to do something other than go downtown with the crowds. We've never experienced the lines of Orlando so the wait time is much shorter and you can cover all the rides easily in a day. It's just not as  magic  as Orlando and everything is smaller   even the castle. It's a small world ride is as good as Orlando though.",3
Their fireworks show is trully magical!!! (One thing I really enjoyed in HK disneyland). Their attractions and shows are for kids.,3
If you've been to the Japan Disneyland or the one in the US. you'll be disappointed with this fraction of kids entertainment. The street parade as always is the must watch.,3
"employees are less friendly,   there is also one store I found there was a package of cakes   candies already open positions.",3
Quite a small Disneyland and everything is overpriced. Lucky we were there on a very quiet day and there was no line up for anything. Easy to get to on the train but not really worth going out of your way for.,3
"Hong Kong Disneyland is small compered with other Disneyland in other countries, but we still had a great time here. You can find a lot of fun in this themed park. It is great choice for one day trip. You can take MTR to Disneyland. So, it is convenient.",3
"Purchase your ticket beforehand. The queues to enter are long, but the queue for tickets is SUPER long. Not many great rides, very kiddish. Suitable for 8 and below. The best ride was Hyperspace Mountain. Book your fast pass time immediately  there are only 3 rides available for fast pass. Download the mobile app   it will tell you the queue times for each ride and all the show times. Dodon't miss the parade at night, and the fireworks  quite spectacular. Super super a lot of ppl, and super hot! ",3
"Great theme park, children fun, overcrowded, you queue for ages on most attractions..Disney prices are not for the faint hearted!",3
"Disneyland Hong Kong is nice to visit with family and kids but doesdon't have enough attractions to fill an entire day. Also, there's really nothing for thrillseekers. Even the Grizzly rollercoaster isdon't really thrilling. Disney Hong Kong desperately needs some topattractions (Tower of Terror, Rock 'n Rollercoaster,...) The park misses the real  magic Disney feel  because of the lack of enough Disney (movie)themed rides. So no Cinderella, Snowwhite etc.Because of all this I find the ticketprice too high!On the other hand the park is really clean, the personnel are very friendly and the food is good! ",3
"This is my second visit to Disneyland park. My last visit was 5 years ago. Both times I went 2 days to the park in the same trip and on weekdays so that it is not that crowded. Found that this time round, the place was no longer that exciting nor many things to do even though they have added in 1 new area. The toy story land was not as interesting as the one I went in Tokyo. Also the were not many rides though it was a new section. Disney service staff was also not as friendly as previously. It is better to go elsewhere but if you have kids of 3 4 years, perhaps this park is still suitable for them. ",3
"The only other Disneyland I have been to is in LA, and the one on Hong Kong Island disappoints by comparison. It is quite small and the rides are quite old. it was more geared for very young kids rather than tweens. There is certainly nothing wrong with that however it is very hot walking around there in June and they were not all that many rides for adults which was a little disappointing",3
Having been to Disneyworld in Orlando the HK Disneyland was bound to disappoint. Its a great outing for kids. For adults its a bit boring . it's very busy and very hot. The fireworks every night at Disney I can see from my home in Discovery Bay.,3
This is one of the smallest Disneyland's however it was still quite expensive for a one day visit. We went mid week to avoid the weekend crowds however it was still very busy. The queues for the rides were long with an average wait of about 30 minutes. I would recommend going when it just opens and doing the popular rides first as the queues will be shorter then. ,3
Visited this Disney land when it first originally open and again when I returned to Hong Kong. Really lovely themes but it was small compared to other Disney theme parks. Also very small compared to Ocean Park which is the better of the two in Hong Kong.,3
"This was the first time we had ever visited any sort of Disneyland before and we werent really impressed. Some of the rides were broken down, the lines were miles long and there was no shade or shelter any where away from the heat and sun. There was also no place to buy any Western food.",3
"Disneyland Hong Kong is a magical place to be specially for the youngster, they do have rides are amazing parade during the afternoon and off course the fire works. Few things to note it is on the prices side to visit and the food inside Disneyland is expensive. Only disappointment was after taking so many picture and we went to the photography section to get our photos printed and the staff was not very helpful at all...they made me go to 3 different counters and the staff where either lost or not willing to attend. Very sad that I had to leave the place without taking any picture taken by the team at Disney.",3
"Its a nice place, beautiful scenery and landscape. We bought the tickets online with meals (lunch and dinner). There is halal option which is gd, the portions really makes us full. We love the shows, its really entertaining. This is our 2nd trip to Hong kong disneyland. Everthing is fine, understand the long queue for photo taking with characters. Overall a wonderful experience and a must visit. ",3
"Was a fun trip with friends! Must watch the shows as they're wonderful! Park is small comparing to other Disney Parks, but you will find loads of fun during your visit! One full day is good enough if you're a first timer! You may download their app for easier planning!",3
"This is no where comparable to one is US. Spend more and go to Florida instead, which is much more bigger than this place and many more rides...",3
"Was left a little disappointed with HK Disneyland. Much smaller than I had anticipated and with few attractions that I have come to expect from Disney resorts.Positives:Easy to get toIron Man ride Negatives:Small compared to other theme parksLack of choice of foodNothing for older Disney fansI woulddon't go again, however, if you have a young family, the magic of Disney may not be lost for children visiting a Disney resort for the first time. ",3
"My family and I had a long layover in Hong Kong en route back to the US from the Philippines, so my eight year old asked if we could visit Disneyland.As others have said, the park is VERY small. We walked around the whole thing in a matter of a couple hours. The rides aredon't the greatest, but there are some fun ones to hit, especially Mystic Manor! The Tarzan area was closed when we visited, so sadly we did not get to explore that. The gardens were super cute though and my daughter loved the green army men ride in Toy Story Land!",3
"Hong Kong Disneyland is small and frankly the rides are very boring and limited.The wait is horrendous, no air conditioning and you'd need to queue up for at least 60 minutes in the hot sun. The crowds are mostly from mainland China, and most of them would probably try to jump queue, if not they'd stand really close behind you whilst you're waiting in line for no apparent reason.Even if you're not participating in any of the rides, make sure to prepare yourself with an umbrella, hat, water and sunscreen. The waiting areas are not sheltered and you could be left sitting in the scorching heat.The good thing about Hong Kong Disneyland, is that the rides have three languages. English, Cantonese and Mandarin.",3
It's a small Disneyland. Summers at Disneyland Hongkong is unbearable with small kids. No fast lane tickets available. Although staff is very friendly. Not much attractions for little children.,3
The park is limited with its restaurants and outlets you cadon't even get a bottle of water without waiting in line !! And shoulddon't water be free ...? The rides are outdated and old style compared to other theme parks ... the worst was the Spider Man adventure !! You wait in line cooking for an hour just to be shuttled into a closed 2 x 2 room with a Chinese guy dressed in a Spider Man suit who only speaks Chinese and asks if you want a photo and that's it!! Seriously ?? Disney you are off my list ...hands down worst ever ,3
"After been to Orlando last year guess hard to try compare , its small just 1 park , about half size of Paris , ideal for children under 8 , apart from the thunder mountain ride rest were tame , the boat trip was ok and we liked the haunted house but rest was mainly young kids rides , this definitely needs some new rides , there was no interactive rides , could be improved loads . It was easy to get to from our hotel in Kowloon about 10 15 mins to the disney stop then change to Disney train 1 stop ",3
"We really enjoyed Hong Kong Disney, however a few of the food outlets were closed. There was next to nothing for vegetarians or vegans. With so many of the food places not being open it made the queues worse. I think if your paying full price everything should be open. It was difficult to meet the characters, unlike when I went Florida and they were about everywhere. ",3
I love Disney parks so when I was in Hong Kong found it necessary to visit. However I was underwhelmed compared with other parks I have visited. I felt like it lacked atmosphere and diddon't have as many rides as I would have expected. Food outlets were limited and I woulddon't recommend the western food. The staff were friendly. This is the only Disney park I havedon't felt the  magic  and probably woulddon't return there. ,3
Went with our 10yr old on what we hoped would not be a rainy day. It is a nice park and easy to get round. We went mid week so the queues for the rides were quite small and there was enough variety to keep her interest. We arrived about 1 2hr after it opened and we had about 4 1 2hrs before it started to rain. A few of the rides were kept open and only lightening made them stop completely. We stayed till the end anyway and saw the fireworks but the parade was cancelled. If you get there when it opens & stay the full day I dodon't think you need more than a day to get round but if it's busy and you have young children 2 days might be better.,3
"Went there in July 2017. The weather was very hot and the park was extremely crowded. I recommend you to buy tickets and meals voucher via online to get the best price. Nothing special, just a normal experience in a theme park. Honestly, I preferred USS more since it is more fun for adults.",3
"It is summer, hot, humid but the kids still wanted to go to Disneyland. I have been to Disneyland in Orlando, Anaheim and Paris and Hong Kong is by far the smallest with no spectacular rides. Everything was smaller except the fireworks at 9:00PM. Nice, but dodon't expect too much.",3
I was really looking forward to HK Disney for my daughter's 5th birthday but felt a bit let down by the experience. The queues were too long and there were no princesses or charterers to be seen except at the end in the parade. The staff were not very cheerful and people pushed in all the time in the lines. They should have a priority queue for people with young kids as it seems unfair that all these adults are taking up the queue space while kids have to stand exhausted in the lines. Also the Disney characters were nowhere to be seen. Standing in queues with small children for a 5 minute ride is not that fun! Still my daughter enjoyed it! I remember Disney LA and euro Disney being much better.,3
"Overpriced with bad services! We were in the line for a game till a local came infront of us to the staffs and asked first, they just let them in and skipped us. When i protested the staff said  sorry (smiling without felt guilty) .1 bottle of water 32 HKD or 4 USD, really ??!?Once i went here, i wont never comeback ",3
"A one day pass for HK Disney cost us about $100 USD per person, which, for what you get, isdon't really worth the cost. If you've already seen Disney World and or Disneyland in the US, HK Disney may disappoint you. Comparatively, it's very small. It's basically a tiny Magic Kingdom without many of the classic rides   no Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain, etc.There are a couple of rides exclusive to HK Disney that are pretty neat. In particular, Mystic Manor is a very fun, smartly designed Haunted Mansion esque ride that I'd highly recommend.Disney fanatics might also want to check out some of the merchandise. There's more than enough of it, and much of it is exclusive to HK Disney.The food is much nicer fancier than the Disney parks food in the US, but it's also considerably more expensive.Getting there via the MTR was fairly easy, though it's a bit of a hike from Hong Kong Island or Kowloon. Getting back was a bit more difficult, since we left with the hordes of other people leaving right after the fireworks show that begins as the park closes. (The show was great, for what it's worth.)We went on a Tuesday, and there weredon't many crowds or long lines. The park actually felt oddly empty. Then again, we were there on a holiday (Dragon Boat Festival), which may have kept a lot of people away, so take that with a grain of salt.",3
For kids who are looking for rides with a little thrill this place leaves a lot to be desired. Overall not a great place to visit but been there done that may apply.Food is expensive and service is lacking. Very difficult to find a young person smiling outside of the performers. The other thing is just a heads up. Many of the rides or exhibits that have voiceovers dodon't have great English. We could barely understand which detracted from the experience. Not complaining just worth noting if you are expecting all communication to be understood.The lines were not that bad but we went on a Friday.,3
"The month of July is not a very ideal time to visit Hong Kong. It was raining the day we arrived in Hong Kong and on the day that we are supposed to be visiting HK Disneyland, it rained 75% of the time. My little one whose 5 years old still was able to enjoy the Disney park special thanks to other Disney characters who bravely came out to Fantasy Garden to greet us despite of unfortunate rainy condition. The Disney Parade was cancelled and of course the fire works. We were disappointed but not that much, my little princess was still able to enjoy the tour at  It's a small world , which I believe is the second highlights of her very first visit to HK Disneyland. You cadon't really do anything if Mother nature wants to rain. BUT I can still try to come back next time with my little princess and I am hoping in December it'll be a different experience...a much more enjoyable and worth Disney vacation. I am still giving HK Disneyland a 5 star ratings because if it diddon't rained, I know my little princess would have enjoyed the Disney tour. ",3
This is probably the smallest of the Disney Parks. You can easily complete all the rides in a day. No that crowded during the week and even at weekends it was tolerable. The overall customer service is in par with other Disney Parks. Only if they expand it sooner to make it much more exciting! ,3
Not exactly my type of theme park. Queues were too long. Came on Friday and Saturday. On average i spend about 30 to 45 minutes to every ride or shows. Shows and parades were good. Some shows were in cantonese. Not many rides. My first time here and probably be my last. ,3
"A small fun place to go but not many rides.  A couple were really good but the rest not great.  Really easy to get too, the metro has it's own Disney train.",3
We have some theme parks close to us at home better than this one for teenagers. It is great for smaller children. However the Lion King performance was by far the exception and was worth seeing on its own. Many food choices and easy access by train. For teenagers try Ocean Park.,3
"I grew up in the U.S. but now live in Hong Kong and was excited to see what this theme park is all about. Granted, it's Disney but for the size and price I dodon't really think it's worth it. I'd go for Ocean Park over this any day. Best time of year to visit would definitely be in the fall or winter and not the hot summer. I would suggest paying extra to get the fast pass at certain rides. Totally worth it and it tells you when to come back for no lines waiting! Of course it is going to be pricey because everything at Disney is.  Have an umbrella (weather can change immediately) sunscreen, hat, sunglasses stay hydrated wear comfortable shoes check to see what time park is open until (the day we arrived it was closing early for a special event!)",3
"Visit on 25 June 2017 with my family. It is not public holiday in Hongkong, but the place was still crowded. I suppose it filled with overseas tourist, especially from Indonesia, since there was long public holiday in Indonesia. My brother purchased the tickets from Singapore.The location of the park is on Lantau Island. Near the Hongkong International Airport. You need to depart on Sunny Bay station if you ride with MTR and then continue with the special line to Disneyland Hongkong.The first thing that I noticed that the station, the train was decorated with Disney Theme, which is kind of improving the holiday mood. And then when the train arrive at the Disneyland station, the MTR announcer say   Have a magical day Alongside the road to the main entrance, there were lamp with poster of Iron Man and other Marvel character. As you may know, that Marvel already been purchased by Disney, which is obviously a great advantage because now Disney can incorporate the Marvel character to their ride, which it makes the Disneyland cooler and help them to step a little bit from their kid intended ride persona. I arrived early at 8 O'clock After exchanging the booking confirmation with ticket, we queued to get the bag check. There was already queued even when the park has not yet opened. The weather is bad, with all of sudden the rain come. You should bring umbrella or raincoat. So after the bag check we queue at the front entrance. It is opened at 9 O'clock but the queue were already long. It is not really pleasant queue since the weather was really hot. There was ( which I thought a VIP family) who granted to gain early access to the park. And the family were being accompanied by some girl staff, and some Disney character and started to take photo at some landmark spot, while we still waiting before the gate open to the common people. And then the gate opened finally, but we still cannot get inside to the main area ( where are the rides located) It is opened at 9.30. I thought that is the strategy so the guest forced to roaming around first at the shops. Of course we will enter the shop since that's the only place that could prevent you from the dead from the heat. The park itself it is not too big. The rides mostly intended for kid, with no high level thrilled rides. There is no roller coaster with loop for example or with corkscrew. My favourite ride were Hyperloop coaster and Iron Man. The food here were expensive. For one plate of fried rice will cost you around 100 HKD. Despite off the portion was quite big ( enough even for 3 persons). The drink even more expensive. But they provided with free drinking water fountain in the front of every restroom.We did not finish all day in here since the weather is really bad. Hot and suddenly rain come. Even at the parade, there was a moderate raining. Overall this park is good for kid, since most of the ride were designed to accommodate kids. But if you are a thrilled seeker maybe you will be disappointed. But still this place is good for photography.",3
"The rides were good as expected but due to the heavy crowd and hot weather, the park should provide more sheltered areas for people waiting for rides. For many rides, waiting in the hot sun was most uncomfortable especially for children. Food options at the park is pretty good but very expensive which is expected. Service level needs to be improved as most staff dodon't even carry a smile on their face which is hardly representative of being  one of the happiest place on earth . Both parades and the fireworks are the highlights of the whole experience.",3
"All kids love Disneyland. This is smaller compared to other Disney places. The staff at the ticketing is very accommodating as i forgot to print my ticket but she was able to call us Asia Travel and get a copy. If you are bringing a little girl, be sure to dress her us like a princess for her to enjoy the place. The queue is long so you need to plan your trip. Dont go there during summer as the place is too hot, or be sure to bring a hat or umbrella and lots of drinking water. Food is expensive, so you can either bring fruits and sandwiches with you. You can watch the parade at the end and there;s a fireworks at 8:45pm. If you are going back to HK Central, you need to prepare for yourself as there are lots of people who will take the MRT.You can also book a hotel at Disney to enjoy the whole day tour.",3
"HK Disney is probably the most conveniently located of all Disneys in the world. A max of 45 min drive from anywhere in Hk. 15 min from the airport. Ideally located to be one of the best   if properly managed.It is also one of the newest   so one wld expect it to be in tip top condition.But frankly   my recent experience is somewhat disappointing.Price wise   it's not bad.We know it's small   comparing to other Disneys   so selection of rides is OK also. In fact for such a compact site, they have done well. The iron man experience was good.Problem is   staff there simply dodon't smile nor do they have the capability of making eye contact. They are simply not welcoming.It's a sad place. Very rude staff.To be more specific   their attitude to a lot of PRC visitors is simply unacceptable. Rude. Lack of patience. Bordering racist. Only PRC customers get that treatment. Note   I'm 100 pc HKer.Also   very disappointing that they diddon't make clear at the time of purchasing ticket that a lot of the rides would be closed at 530 for private events. All in all   just v poor management and if i HK Govt helps out in any way financially, I am gutted as a Hk tax payer.",3
This is a small park that can be done in one day. The service and cleanliness is not on par of Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea. The souvenirs and snacks are cheaper here and they have rides you woulddon't find at the other Disneys. Just dodon't expect happy and smiling attendants and you wodon't be disappointed.,3
"Pros: 1. Very short wait time compared to Shanghai Disneyland; 2. Most rides and shows are in English; 3. Staff understand English (even though some of them may not fully understand you so you would need to repeat sometimes)Cons: 1. Failure of using Disney Point: Using full palm is fine but I saw cast members using one finger point when assigning line at Tomorrowland; 2. Had some really old and cold food (the Indonesian seafood fried rice combo) at Tahitian Terrace; 3. The information from the cast member here may not be necessarily correct like that in the states: for example, I asked a cast member from PhilharMagic where does the evening parade start, and he told me it started from Main Street USA which was incorrect and totally the opposite. 4. Diddon't see a lot of  Disney Scoop  and saw some trash during non parade fireworks time. 5. Saw several cast members using cell phone on stage.Other thoughts: overall the cast members' energy and smile are better than those from SHDR and more responsive in general, while SHDR focuses more on Disney Point and trash free environment. It's a bummer that there's no Downtown Disney in HK. Must dos if you're a cast member from the states: Iron Man Experience   a Star Tours like ride that is about Iron Man and Hong Kong, really unique and amazingMystic Manor   A slow moving ride that is similar to Haunted Mansion with a different story settingRC Racer   just do itFestival of Lion King   more singing and less dancing compared to the one in Animal Kingdom. The show is really goodAlso: check out the deals and promos of ticket online and download the app before you go(The pic attached was taken in the evening around 8 inside a store in Adventureland where it was not busy and the cast members were around)",3
"Having already arrived without any expectation, we were even more disappointed by the quality of their best rides. All of us were over 20 yo so we had targeted rides with height warnings such as Iron Man Experience, Grizzly Gulch, Speed Racer, and Hyperspace Mountain etc. Iron Man was the most disappointing of them all, as the '4DX' movie was too short, had an unimaginative storyline and was by far the worst disney ride. Hyperspace Mountain had been bought by Star Wars and its opening tune as we rode into pitch black was exciting and familiar. The ride was probably the best one and we went on it 3 times, but the lighting wasnt perhaps too bright and we could see some of the roller coaster's structure, which sort of ruined the  space illusion , unlike the one in Paris. Grizzly Gulch, an outdoor coaster, was also graced by our bums 3 times as well. To be fair, there was nothing wrong with the ride (it even had a surprise factor) however we were used to the likes of alton towers and our experienced and wise selves craved a higher thrill factor. Brownie points: great dim sum restaurant (presented by Maxim's) at number 7 on the map. The churros sold at stores dotted around the park were also spot on and brought back childhood memories.",3
could do with more diaper changing and nursing facilities. there's none in the ladies at various attraction and nursing room is only at main street. food standard can also improve,3
"If you have small children then HK Disney is probably worth a visit, but if you have seen the LA and Orlando versions, then perhaps dodon't bother. HK Disney is just as slick, but it's about 1 4 of the size and the rides   attractions are limited. Cost is quite high. Entry is about $100 Australian Dollars ($75 USD) and food onsite is pricey too. I'm not sorry I went, sure I had fun but as an adult it was all over for me in less than 3 hours.",3
"I have no doubt it would have been great if we had weather hadnt been so bad. Everything was rained off including the parades. Dont waste your time or money if the weather is bad.Also, the place isnt that big so do not go at 9am because there wont be enough to do until the shows at 8pm. Would recommend going around 2pm.",3
"The hotel is nice, although not many activities for children, you simply stay there and enjoy the room. You have to eat in the hotel, which is very expensive. Went swimming with the kids, and get bitten by fleas in the garden (about 50 bites). It took me 2 weeks to heal. I had a week of unbearable suffering of itchiness. ",3
"I love Disney parks, I have been in 4 already and I have to say this one was really disappointing, it is very small and all the attractions are for kids, I tried all the  fast  roller coasters and I diddon't like them. I went on a Friday and it was pretty empty so it was easy to go to the attractions, without the lines. The parade was very good as in every Disney park. And the area of pandora is like being in the princess movie, I really recommend it. I really like the metro station that you can take to get into the park, it is very cheap and comfortable. (Pink line) ",3
If you have kids then you would definately enjoy .. but youngsters or couples wodon't enjoy at all . Except 2 3 rides all other rides are for kids .. not worth spending so much on kids rides when you dodon't have them.,3
"While I prefer ocean park as an amusement park, Disneyland is a unique place to visit. The rides we took were fun and the place is really beautiful. However two main issues you should be aware of: lines to attractions are loooong (often 30min ). You can see their length in the app however which helps planning. Even bigger issue was that when we were there half the restaurants were closed and lines to the open restaurants were wayyyyy long and choices limited. ",3
"Many had suggested I skip HK disneyland and go to the one in Tokyo.Although the HK park is small and not too exciting, for 4 5 year olds, it's plenty for a few days.Not overly crowded in March and weather is good. I wasdon't too disappointed but go in with low expectations.",3
"Not a true disney exoerience; it's like a classic franchise concept... doesdon't have the same charm or depth as the US or Japanese Disney's and having done them all, definitely the lowest from a thrilling day out standpoint. Expensive day out and can get very busy. ",3
"We left around noon on a Wednesday, and we were happy to see that the place was fairly empty with most people working. With still around 7 hours to go, we did the park at ease and did the more  adult  rides. I'd say you could do this park in about 4 5 hours. We stayed till the fireworks, which is something you just have to see when you're at Disneyland. I'd recommend to look at the fireworks from the shopping street as you can leave immediately afterwards and you're not caught in the mass of people.I think it's nice the trains are personalised to Disney figures. Good connection as there's a special Disneyland stop. I enjoy they really try to suck you in the magical atmosphere they have. As expected the food is quite expensive here, so we diddon't eat here. Overall, nice experience but it's nothing compared to the real thing: Disneyland Paris.",3
"Went to HK Disneyland for my birthday and of course, I had to get a badge from the office before starting. Throughout our visit, NOT A SINGLE cast member wished me a Happy Birthday (I was quite hurt). The cast members all looked like they've been owed their wages and did not look like they were working at the most magical place on earth. It wasdon't even a particularly busy day because it had rained in the morning, so we could only go in at almost noon ish. The only up side was the queues were relatively short, but that's about it. Dodon't think it's worth spending close to a $100 (SGD) here. Will probably be my last visit. I'd rather save more money and go to Tokyo Disneyland.",3
"Hk Disney is smaller then others in been too but it isdon't a Disneyland u expect . For some reason the castle look very bad , the attractions is similar to dineland Paris but less , it have iron man that was cool , but the lines killed me .Diddon't enjoy it much but Disney is Disney and in some places the magic was there and some other .... not",3
"Always great to go back to childhood, attractions were great but in the half day we had done most of them. It is more for kids but worth the visit!",3
This was a slightly disappointing visit. I expected there to be more rides. As an adult I was after more roller coaster and thrill rides. It catered for mainly you d children. Grounds very tidy and clean. The food was also very good. I probably woulddon't return or see the need for a 2 day pass. Everything is able to be achieved in one day. ,3
"I knew this place wasdon't going to be up to much as we've already done Florida.I was pleasantly surprised by the transport to the park, the train was fun.Main Street is lovely, sleeping beauty castle is small & underwhelming.Everything looks a little tired & run down but I've read it's on the verge of huge investment.The staff are not like Disney staff and really look like they'd rather be somewhere else.The parade was great and a lot less busy than Florida so you get to sit right on the pavement at Main Street.Merchandise much cheaper than America.Fireworks were not worth waiting for.I've done it once, I woulddon't go back.",3
"this disney is aimed at the younger audience as theres not dead loads there & they start closing down the rides very early. evening parade cancelled when we were there due to weather , there was only 2 spots of rain",3
"An impromptu visit with my son (12 years) and although we knew there weredon't many of the bigger rides there was enough to keep us entertained for the day. There were hardly any queues this day despite being Easter Sunday so we delightfully did double rounds on our favourite rides. The price is quite reasonable and worth paying just to see the Lion King show, incredible. Blew us away and a pleasant treat too.More for younger children and easy to get around, worth it if you want an easy get away day with kids",3
"Very ordinary experience with most of the rides, experiences and shows rather outdated and in need of serious revitalizing.",3
I went there with my family last week. It's a nice place but does not have the feel of Disneyland. Mostly because most of the themes are from newly acquired studios. For example there is quite a big Toy Story area. There is no Pirates of the Caribbean nor Haunted Mansion. The old steam train only has one stop. No Dinosaurs etc. It's a diet version of Disneyland. Can you enjoy yourselves? Sure. Check it out. You're already here.,3
"Hong Kong Disneyland is smallest when comparing with those in other cities. Most spots and games are similar, but some are lacking. One can finish in walking and playing around in shorter time. If you have been to Disneyland in USA and Japan, there is no surprise, and it is not really worth a visit. But if you have not been to any Disneyland before, perhaps you may like to have a try.",3
"If you've never been to Disneyland or Disney World, this might be OK. If you have, you still might like the fireworks display that happens every night.",3
"If you have never visited any other Disney Park in the world, then this is a nice beginner's experience. The park is small and on a non peak day, you can ride all the rides in about three hours. I went to the park on a holiday peak day, but the longest line I had to wait on was marked 35 minute wait time but it was only 20 minutes. The Iron Man experience is the only exclusive ride there. Everything else can be found in other Disney Parks. (It's A Small World. Hyper Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters, Winnie The Pooh, etc.). It is missing a lot of iconic Disney Rides   Splash Mountain, Cinderella Carousel, etc.If you dodon't go to this park, you wodon't really miss much. I would not call this a must do attraction. The Tian Tun Buddha on Lantau Island is a MUST DO instead.",3
"It is great to spend your day here,, especially with your bestfriend.. dont forget to buy miny mouse hat, cotton candy, and rainbow balloon,,, so instagramable...",3
"Compared to Los Angeles and Tokyo Disneyland, HK Disneyland is jut average but if you are a first timer, that's OK",3
"In essence with everything you could be in America, just a few variations but mainly it hasdon't the scale of its Florida La counterpart, still worth a visit but found it suffered from a lack of choice of rides",3
"My first Disneyland. The land was fantastic, the worlds were awesome to see. The characters were all dressed in their Christmas outfits. Very expensive to eat and buy souvenirs. Lots of food choices and plentiful seating. The rides were all slow and short, like they were built only for children. Lots of toilets and wonderful atmosphere. When your in hong kong you should catch the Mickey mouse train and spend the day explorong just for the fun. ",3
I actually dodon't feel that I was in a Disneyland. That was a weekday but there were so many people. I dodon't even meet any characters there! Nevertheless it did not take long to queue and we managed to see the new iron man show which is fantastic. There were not a lot of eateries around except popcorns! The fireworks and parade were great though. Overall I dodon't get that fantasy feeling at all but we still enjoyed ourselves with our family. By the way the castle is really small... ,3
"Cost us around   60 each for a ticket, which we diddon't think was bad value to get into a Disney park. First off I have to say we have been lucky enough to visit Orlando Disney on many occasions so we found it difficult to not compare the two parks. We found staff to be lovely whenever we encountered them, no issues at all. The park was clean. We went to the Iron Man experience and have to be honest we all found it a little disappointing, it was a nice ride but think we expected more from it. We rode the Toy. Story space rangers ride which was the same a Orlando but it kept stopping   not sure if it was a technical issue but did detract from the ride a little. Witnessed some inconsiderate behaviour in the queues   people coming out the queues then literally shoving past people to get back in. We queued for a while to ride the Jungle River Rapids, we weredon't overly impressed with this ride (although the staff worked hard to make it fun). We then went to Toy Story Land and rode the Racing Car ride   waited for 1 2 hour but it was well worth it   great ride. It was a nice day out, the castle was very underwhelming compared to Orlando, the park in general was much smaller but it is a nice park and worth a visit. We went on the MTR which was very easy to find our way to Disney,",3
Been four times and it is going down hill.Lion King is great but.  The staff are not what you expect of DISNEY,3
"The very worst thing about thisDisney land is the smoking!!!  They smoke anywere,even in the little park for toddlers,I made a complaint,but they diddon't want to know.  The place is very clean,and I did enjoy the live shows",3
Hong Kong Disney was okay. Unlike in Florida where you are greated with smiles and they're are more charter visits. Hong Kong Disney was definitely lacking in this area. Tinkerbell also failed to show up at the fireworks which is the best part at Disney. The Lion King show was fabulous. Pooh ride was closed unfortunately:( polution level were also high when we went to Hong Kong not my favorite city for that reason. ,3
"A good point is not as crowded as another Disney resort. Although it was not a holiday, it was not very crowded. Most of the attractions could ride within 15 minutes. Even Iron man which is also the latest attraction. It was wonderful for us. We were able to catch many attractions in half a day.On the other hand, many restaurants were closed. Several shops were open, but I felt a little lonely. Is not this a dreamland?",3
"We booked Disneyland for my son's 4th birthday; he was looking forward to seeing Mickey and having his picture taken with him. Unfortunately it appears Mickey runs on an extremely tight schedule. Every time we queued up to catch a glimpse, we were told in an extremely curt manner that Mickey was on a break or that the queue was now closed. In a park as big as this, could they risk two Mickey characters wandering around, so as not to disappoint the many children who have come to see him? If you adore shopping for Disney themed souvenirs, then this is the place for you. The whole park has been set up, almost exclusively, to do this alone. Some staff were not overly friendly to say we were in the magical kingdom. I would save your money and if your kids love Disney, treat them to the dvds and lots of treats from the Disney store.",3
We took our family here when they came to visit us which included my 2 year old nephew and 4 year old niece. The parades are fun to watch and it was nice to see the excitement on the kids faces but I otherwise would not come if i diddon't have children with me.,3
"If you never been to Disneyland or you are a big fan of Disneyland, there is no harm to go. If not, not a must see hot spot in Hong Kong indeed. However, the park outside the Disneyland is nice and free of charge which local people like to go in the weekend with their kids.",3
"We visited on a rainy day, the ticket is over prized and not much to do for adults.Most of the park was closed due to rain,Tomorrow land was good though.",3
"There are not many things surprised. It's just a normal place for childen.I'm sure that many people expect a lot before going in, but would be failed or disappointed, since it's so normal except the forest zone.As well, there are not many useful or valueable stuffs to buy in the souvenir shops, but very expensive. The food inside the disneyland was so expensive, you should not eat anything inside, even a cone of icecream. ",3
Had an average time caused quite a few of the attractions were closed for maintenance. Food was good but way too expensive. Staff are very helpful.,3
4 hours is enough for this overrated park. my son said he is bored by the first hour.  if one has never been to any disney. my suggestion is to go to another one before you lost interest in future disney's trip.,3
"We travelled here in February, which I think is the peak of low season, as such, quite a few attractions were closed for maintenance. The park itself is not huge, but enjoyable for my 5 year old daughter. The bonus was that there were hardly any queues and we managed to return multiple times to her favourite rides. The food offering was limited and really bad ... A number of dining joints were closed ... Worth taking your little ones.",3
"Greetings ,To be frank it's not worth as what sayThe charger near 80 usd per personThere is only show that looks ok To Hongkong Disney you go metro as well It's not far from airport Overall it's so so but it's Seems they and developing more so hope would be better Regards Vk",3
"I visited this place together with my sister's family and this was the second Disneyland I have visited. The other one was the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California.The positive aspects: We enjoyed the Ironman ride, the Star Wars hyperspace mountain ride, the Mystic manor ride, the Grizzly Gulch runaway mine cart ride, the Lion King show, Mickey's Magical book show and Mickey's Philharmagic show. You need to plan your schedule in the theme park carefully in order to get to see the shows at the designated times. Long queues for the rides is a normal sight, you have to be patient and be prepared to queue up between 45 minutes and 1 hour for each ride.The negative aspects: Not surprisingly, 85% of the visitors to this Disneyland comprise of mainland Chinese tourists. The worst thing about this is, these people are really rude, rowdy, impatient and down right ill mannered. They let their young children pee all over the place in public instead of taking them to the washrooms, which are conveniently located all over the theme park! Here is an example; while we were queueing for the Disney train ride within the park(the train which takes visitors from Fantasyland to the main street station), there was a mainland Chinese family who had a toddler of around 3 years old behind us in the queue. The toddler told his father that he needed to answer a call of nature and the father told him to do it right there and then, on the pavement!!! We watched in horror as the father unzipped the boy's trousers and let him pee right on the pavement, 2 feet away from us!!!!!! Totally disgusting!!!!!! That wasdon't the only such incident we witnessed!!! All day long, as we walked around the park, we saw countless such incidents where mainland Chinese families let their children pee in the planter boxes, flower shrubs, next to the lamp posts and on the pavements in public!!!If you and your family want to have a great, enjoyable experience in a Disney theme park, do not come here! Please visit the Disneyland in Anaheim, California. People there are more civilized, civic conscious, hygienic, courteous and well mannered.",3
Decent for first timers but not worth the price and wait when you have an opportunity to visit other disneylands,3
"Another trip to Hong Kong Disneyland. I have been here over twenty times. I must say that the overall standards in terms of service and attitude have decreased dramatically. There are still some cast members that try to do their jobs as best as possible, but it is evident that most of them display a hatred for their jobs. Everything is getting more expensive, but it clearly does not reflect in their guest service and guest interaction. Hardly any smiles and no one goes out of their way to make it a magical moment for the guests. When my mom who was actually very happy to come to Disneyland this month wanted to take a photo with a storm trooper, she was denied. However, when it was evident that there two obvious looking foreigners, then they gave them exceptional service and allowed them to take photos and gave them handshakes. This type of behavior should not exist at Disneyland and it shows that management does a really poor job on training and oversight. Overall, it was a very substandard service kind of day. The food is just okay. It used to be better. Hopefully, management will read enough of these reviews to care to better manage their parks and resorts.",3
"If you're in Hong Kong for a limited amount of time, I would recommend Ocean Park instead especially if you dodon't have kids! Not much to  thrill  you if you're between 16 40 years old haha but great for the younger ones!",3
"I live in California and have been to Disneyland in Anaheim several times. My first time to Hong Kong Disneyland was a nice 1 2 day trip. Its quite small and has very few rides. I think its a nice place if you have very young children, but for the teens there are only a couple of rides.",3
Was very small and as we didnt go on the school holidays half the park was closed but full price for tickets was still asked for. Not enough English speaking guides. Was left very confused not knowing what was said. To much was about mickey and mini mouse and not enough on the other disney characters. Unless the kids really bug you about going dont waste your money.,3
"My family and I have been to Euro Disney in France, Disneyland in California and Disney World in Florida. On this family trip, we are going to Hong Kong Disneyland and in a couple days, we'll visit Shanghai Disneyland. I guess maybe I was expecting too much from Hong Kong Disneyland. While we enjoyed the public train ride to the resort, it was overwhelming unorganized, as people pushed to get on and off and rushed to get into the park. All we can say is that we were here and one item off our bucket list. Here's to hoping Shanghai Disneyland will not disappoint.",3
"HK Disney is small but they have built more and more since it was first opened. So every time I go back, there's a new ride waiting for me. For visitors who just want to visit once, then save it for later days as more rides will be available.They host some special night time events nowadays, look out for those events and they could make your visit more interesting.Transportation is fairly easy, and there's always a parking spot for you if you drive.",3
"It is good value for kids.. if you are a kid at heart it can be ok too, there is nothing scary unless you're a scarf cat... we enjoyed ourselves and and we are over 40",3
Went there as it's my girl's birthday. Nothing exciting as has been here many times. Staff at the ticket booth not friendly n feel agitated when dealing with customers unlike the first time when we visit when they were newly opened. Now there is express ticket counter where we can get n need not wait for long g time however we did not try this as park was not crowded. Lion King show is fantastic. They have only one new ride.,3
"It cadon't be the happiest place on earth if it's filled with pushing shoving tourists and crowd. The queues were horrific and there was no management of the queues. The crowd was jumping queue, queuing for a family of 14, and, ill mannered. It made for a negative experience all round. The food was expensive and the restaurant areas were not properly maintained. By that I mean that it was not cleared up fast enough to manage the throngs coming into the restaurants. Needs crowd control, more affordable restaurants with ample seating and more expansive menus. ",3
"But realize that this is one of the smallest Disney parks and it diddon't have too much to offer. The best attraction is Mystic Manner, not so scary version of haunted mansion and Aladdin mixed into a ride. They apparently are going under some reconstruction to enlarge the park and add more features. ",3
The park only open at 10.30am and it is very crowded at the gate before it is opened.Ask the staff what is inside before joining the queue as you might queue for an hour for just 30 seconds photo taking.,3
"HK Disneyland is most suitable for the younger kids. It is small a nd somewhat boring compared to the others we've been to. The Disneyland Hotel was the highkight for our son, with it's Disney Channel in the bathtub and really great wading swimming pool area.If a Disneyland in Asia is your destination   the place to go is Tokyo.",3
"I knew the park was smaller than the average Disney property, but was surprised at just how small it was. Also, it was disappointing that two rides were closed for maintenance (although I certainly appreciate that they are maintained!) I went with my boyfriend on a Thursday. Thankfully because the lines were pretty long and I cadon't imagine what they'd be like on a weekend. Even though they were long, they did go by quickly.The Ironman 4 D  ride  was great, as was the mine car rollercoaster. The jungle ride was silly and boring. We also took a ride thru the Magic Manor (I think that's the name) and it was cute. We did the tea cups and the parachute ride.As is typical with Disney, very expensive, but there were a lot of restaurants to choose from. I do wish there were more varieties of snacks throughout the park. It was very clean and there were a lot of employees. Everyone spoke English which was helpful and not expected.",3
"This was the second time we visited the park and I diddon't realise how small it was until we got here. That may be a good thing if you only have a day and have small children, so you dodon't have to walk much. We were here for three days and it was bit too much time with too little to do. Also, the disappointment is probably more because we visited Paris Disneyland last year and Tokyo the year before, so in comparison, Hong Kong Disneyland pales. However, we diddon't even need any fastpasses for any of the attractions as the rides weredon't very crowded with all wait times less than 20 mins. We also caught the Lion King three times and the kids did they favourite rides numerous times. We diddon't even use the priority pass we had for the iron man experience as the wait time was under 15 minutes. There aredon't many thrill rides other than runaway minecart as hyperspace mountain is under refurbishment. If this is the first park you'll be visiting, then go for it. But if you've been to other parks around the world, you might end up disappointed. ",3
"As HUGE Disney fans, this was one of the biggest draws in visiting Hong Kong. Unfortunately the park just seemed to be missing the magical Disney atmosphere of most Disney Parks. The castle is far too small (but I believe there are plans for it being improved), there is no area for shows infront of it. The cast members were not as happy and bubbily as with other parks. The park has all the traditional areas and the rides are whole family friendly. We also booked a Private Tour through the park website which was amazing. Dani, our host, spoke fantastic English and was able to restore that Disney feeling that had been missing. The private tour makes you feel like a rockstar as you get to queue jump on most of the rides and get reserved seating in shows. Would definitely recommend anyone to do this.",3
"Large scale Disney gift shop featuring a few rides. The rides are all very tame, which makes it good for family's with young kids. I visited on a Thursday and the queues were at worst 30ish minutes. Was a pleasant 'Disney experience' which the wife loved, and against my better judgement I kind of enjoyed, but if it's exciting rides you want, then go to Ocean Park.",3
"Disappointing because it's a bit small. If you've been to any other Disney theme park I think this one woulddon't compare favorably.   On the plus side, of you are Disney mad and have small kids it sure it would be fun!",3
"If you have already been to Orlando Disney or EuroDisney, and you have few days in Hong Kong, it's not worth to visit because it doesdon't have new different attractions.Therefore, if you have time and want to meet Chinese Mikey, it's a small but very nice Disney.",3
Probably good if you are a kid and this is your first Disney trip but cannot compare this to the other Disney parks. Very small and lacks the true wow factor. Might have something to do with the government being a major shareholder. So ok but not the place of my dreams. Give ocean park a try instead ,3
We went on monday so it was not that busy. Weather was great. Most rides unsuitable for our 3 yr old. The staff are mostly ok but we bumped into some really poorly trained ones with a lack of common sense.,3
"Love the shops there, massive selection of merchandise that even I coulddon't resist. Can do with more attractions. Stay for the night parade and then the fireworks.",3
"One day here should be enough to get to see what you would like to see.Entry is about 70 Euros. You can take the MRT   about 6 stops from HK station.Get your Fast Track Passes as soon as you enter. Seems you cant take cans of drinks inside, but we seem to have been ok with plastic bottles.Download the app before you go   that was a huge help, as you can navigate around the park and the best feature was that you could see how long the actual wait time is for the individual rides.Avoid the hot dogs   probably the worst in Hong Kong, possibly in the whole of South East Asia. Drinks are pricey: a bottle of Coke will set you back about 4.50    .Some of the toilets were in a filthy state.",3
"Disneyland was never going to be my cup of tea. I got a good deal on tickets from Klook, which lessened the pain somewhat. But it is still prohibitively expensive, especially when you add in transport and overpriced food and souvenirs. Even on a relatively quiet mid week day it was crowded and most of the rides had 10 30 minute waits. The kids maintained their enthusiasm reasonably well and perhaps there is benefit in teaching patience. We stayed for the best part of a day but only saw about a third of the park. If you are a Disney enthusiast, I would suggest two full days, especially if you are there during a busy time. In the interests of balance, I asked the kids for a different perspective. This is how it looked to the people that really matter :From my four year old son: My favourite part was hugging Mickey and Minnie and the Ding Dong train (Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad). My next favourite was the Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride and the horsey ride (Cinderella Carousel). I even liked the new train that took us there (Disneyland MTR line). The dog one (Slinky Dog Spin ride in Toy Story land) was very scary. Eight year old daughter had a similar perspective: The visit to Disneyland was special for me because there is no Disneyland in Sydney where I live. I have never been to any Disneyland except this one in Hong Kong. I liked the Dumbo merry go round because you can steer it up and down. I also liked the Cinderella horse merry go round. I got on a big white horse that looked angry and fast. Then we watched the Disney characters go in a parade. The only thing I disliked was having to wait in line. ",3
"Easily the most expensive place to spend money, not great value. Roughly   60 per person for one day pass. Many attractions were closed or closed early in the day meaning little return on your money. Fireworks at 8pm and it's everybody out by 8 15pm! We made a mistake coming here for the day; I hear Ocean Park is better value. This is just another Disney Park with little other than the words 'Hong Kong' making different to any other Disney Park. If you're travelling from Europe or USA and have been to another Disney Park already then give this one a miss; if you really want to go, only allow 5 hours   thats enough.",3
"Reaching : easy connected via metro  Place : Good for kids only, will be upset if you seen US  Cost : very costly for the time you spend",3
"First the good, you only need one day in this park. In one full day you can do everything in the park. The superb MTR underground railway, is a great and eay way yo get to the doorstep of the park. The staff seems to try hard to make it a real Disney Park. Now the bad, it is small the whole park is less than the smallest area in the Florida park. Most of the rides and things from the US parks will not be here. Look for 1 or 2 rides per area. The food is not like normal Disney food, more like poor quality street food. The items available in the stops is limited and double what the cost was in America the last time I was at the park. It is Hong Kong with lots of tourist so long lines. The bottom line if you are here living in Asia it is a choice, but dodon't travel thousands of miles to visit this park it is just not worth it.",3
"It was in June when I visited with my senior citizen parents. it was indeed very hot but we enjoyed the Lion King Show the most among other shows and the magnificent fireworks at night. Well, its not really for elders because they have the queue up for a very long time to watch the musical show. I wish they have a special lane for elders.",3
the Hong Kong Disneyland is really small compared to other Disneyland and with not too many attractions. I think there are far better amusement parks and we did not feel the real Disney spirit there as well. When being in Hong Kong there are better things to do....,3
"It is a small park comparing to Paris one or a US one. The different is that everything is decorated is chinese style and the food is multiculture. The park itself is quite standard as other Disney parks with lots of people, noise but with lots of fun for kids as well",3
"My wife and I made a quick 2 hour visit to the HK Disneyland. The rate for senior 65 and over is $100 HK or about $15 US which is a great price as compared to over $570 HK for a regular adult ticket. The park is considerably smaller than the ones in the U.S. with many the same attractions and layout. We did a quick train ride boarding at Main Street Station and briefly walk through Fantasy Land and Tomorrow Land. We did not try the rides in consideration of our ages. Overall, it was a nice visit but nothing special for us. It was easy to get to the park via MTR to Sunny Bay Station and change to the Disneyland Line (Pink Line).",3
"I love theme park but this disneyland somehow didnt give me that kick. It is a typical disney park but this is a very small park. Do not compare to the one in us. And to me i still prefer disneysea in japan. It is more for the kids and those challenging enough for adults are probably only the toy story and the starwars hyper space mountain which is fun. Also the grizzly bear roller coaster has a twisted surprise which I diddon't expect so it was a good experience. I dodon't get the chance to watch the shows, sad. Because i had to take dad back to the hotel and return again to disney. Anyway we almost tried all the ride in just one day. Oh and the mystic manor is also entertaining. The one which you rode on a boat through the river is also nice to try. Make sure to stay and watch the fireworks. The buzz lightyear is also nice esp for kids. And they have a new iron man, which similar to transformer ride in universal studio singapore, the kids will love this. Overall it is a good park of course but compare to other disney then it is just an average disney park ",3
"Thought we'd come for the day as avid Disney fans, but this park is super small compared to the US versions. We'd done all the good rides after a few hours! Note   taxis dodon't take credit cards in HK for some strange reason and a lot of the shops  stalls inside the park dodon't either! Cash only!",3
"We have been to Euro Disney before. This is much smaller. The rides more or less the same. As it was near Christmas time, everything was in the Christmas spirit. Was a fun day out",3
"Compared to Tokyo Disneyland which I've been 8 times, this park in HK is lack lustre in terms of scale and more importantly, the feeling of warmth and happiness that it's supposed to bring to visitors.My 3 year old daughter eagerly queued and waited patiently for her turn to take picture with Elsa and Anna at one of the restaurants during lunch time. And she waited once again to speak with them when she realised that she forgot to ask them why they did not come to Singapore (a genuinely innocent question for a young child), during her turn to take photograph. She was only patronisingly acknowledged by the cast members and was ushered away without getting a reply from them. This disappointing response from Disney characters, who are known to be friendly and warm at all times, was actually rather appalling if you ask me. (P.s. The adults were not too impressed with their looks too, given that they were supposed to be pretty princesses.) My poor little girl kept asking me why they did not answer her and wore a sad look on her face for a while, until her next meeting with Donald and Daisy outside the Emporium at around 2pm.This time, she was turned down yet again when she offered M&M candies, which she just purchased from the shop, to them. This was easier to explain to her cos they were working and they did not have a real  mouth piece  to consume food.Overall, the experience at HK Disneyland can be improved if they really want to pride themselves as the happiest place on earth.",3
"Who doesdon't love Disney? I was able to go to Disney in US so I have some sort of idea what to expect like kiddie rides and the very long lines, overpriced food, the parade in the afternoon and of course the fireworks. Of course there's gonna be a significant difference but still, Disney brings out the kid inside of you.",3
It is average place. I visited Euro Disneyland and this one does not have anything more attractive. Long queue and not all games have fast track.,3
"I have been to other Disneyland but this was the first one where a large number of staff do not smile or greet you enthusiastically. The foreign staff, however, are always in character and smiling and friendly so this may just be a Hong Kong culture. The park is not as good as others and the parade is small (around 8 floats) and the firework display at night is underwhelming. The restaurants are really good with a lot friendlier staff so this was really the highlight of the visit",3
"A nice to do when visiting HK with kids. Dodon't expect much. This is a small version of Disney Paris and a fraction of Disney world. Expect lost of crowd during weekend, with Chinese fellow visiting over",3
If you have visited Disneyworld in Florida you may be disappointed in Disney Hong Kong. The castle is underwhelming to say the least and the place is quite dirty. Many attractions close by 2000 even though fireworks are at 2100. The positive was that there was not the crowds at all that Disneyworld sees and so no waiting for rides. (Longest was 30 mins) and that was rare. My teenagers rode hyperspace mountain 7 times. I am a huge Disney fan and so was glad we went however would not go back. ( I have been to Disneyworld 5 times and would return). The cast members were not out to help you have a magical day and overall just wasdon't even close to the standards one expects for a Disney park ,3
"Disne HK was easily accessible by public transport, even from HK Island. Full fun day for the kids, lots of walking, and lot of waiting in queue too! We managed to catch the Ironman Experience twice when it was open over the Christmas weekend. Food choices there however were not as good as the one at Disneyland Japan Disney Sea, minimal choices of snacks on the go.",3
It's my first time in Hong Kong Disneyland and it is more expensive than the Tokyo one. The price gone up just 2 days before our visit.Nothing special if you've been to Disneyland in other part of the world. The good thing is the average queueing time was about 20 minutes compared to my last visit in Tokyo which we wait for at least 30 minutes or more for most ride.,3
"I am a Disneyland lover but the tickets for the park were sold via the hotel we stayed at and at no time from the sale to getting into the gate at the park were we informed that most of rides in a third of the park areas, food carts and stall close at 6pm. The park is advertised as open til 9pm.In addition the parade takes place in total darkness and you cadon't move around freely for fear of falling in the dark or being robbed. This is a danger for both older and younger people.We did approach the Disneyland staff to complain about the price of the tickets   given they were charged at a full rate  with no after 5pm rate applicable and only portion of the park available to access. So I am not sure I would say rush off to this park if you are in Hing Kong. It's expensive and not nearly as fun as Disneyland Los Angles   Anaheim park.",3
"It has been like a family virture to make almost one visit since its opening. The park is way too small, the temperature is way too hot and the humidity is unbearable. It rained non stop most of day during our visit.The converted space mountain to Star War ride is pleasant and interesting, at least on the first ride, that is.On the otherhand the Wondrous book show is magical, a must see attraction, it added some glitters to our family tradition activity.Noticeble much less tourists, imagine it was a public holiday in both Hong Kong and Mainland China. Fast pass is useless since all attractions took less than 30 minutes waiting. For the Star War ride, by the end of the day, there was no line up. My kids and I had three rides back to back. (It was revolting to the stomach...)",3
"The name  Disneyland  makes you all excited about what's inside, about the facilities etc etc, however, Disneyland Hong Kong provides little to no excitement at all. It is very small for a theme park standard, it has limited number of rides and most of which are, although very child friendly, boring. The scenery however, was extraordinary. They perfectly captured the essence of every theme, some themes however, somehow gave the impression that they were minor attractions basically because there were little to no rides in them at all. Having said that, I conclude that the Tommorowland attraction is the best, especially the buzz lightyear ride, really fun, lined up thrice for that ride.",3
"I went on Christmas Day 2016, the crowd was not as many as I expected. I bought the admission tickets online and went thru via Magic Access line, which happens to be where I got the 3 in 1 meal coupons (Lunch, Snacks, Dinner). I'd recommend going to Explorer's Club Restaurant at Mystic Point as the portions are bigger (2 set meals of shared amongst 2 adults and 1 tween) compared to Clopin's Festival of Foods (1 set meal of a mickey mouse pizza is not enough for my tween!) at Fantasyland.",3
"Spent the day today at HK Disneyland, and found that compared to their counterparts in Japan, HK is just ok.We got there at opening time, this is a good idea as for the first hour or two, lines for rides were non existent. I was especially pleased we got to try out the brand new Iron Man ride, which was slot of fun. This park is superior in the sense they had much more content available in English as compared the the Japanese parks.However we quickly came to realise the park is particularly small! I would say after three hours or so we'd seen the whole park and all the attractions we were interested in.The place is well run and we'll staffed. But for the very high ticket prices they charge, I'm not sure three or four hours is value for money. The twin Japanese parks give you slot more bang for your buck.One other note was the stupid prices for food inside the park. I guess one should just expect to get gouged for everything at a theme park, but they seem to have mastered the art at HK Disney. A very average and plain cheeseburger cost $26 AUD. I paid less than that for a burger at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant! So if you remember, bring some stuff with you.",3
Okay experience overall! However wasdon't for the ages 12  as most of the rides and attractions was targeted for younger children. However if you are 12  and like that sort of thing then go for it! Very expensive to purchase anything there so make sure to buy and pack food in advance to save money. ,3
"I avoid crowds as I dodon't want to ruin my day. However my daughter has been asking to go Disneyland. I relented and went Disneyland hopping this holiday. First hongkong Disneyland last week and shanghai Disneyland today.I have to say, I had higher expectations for the service in hongkong than shanghai. After all, Hong Kong has been in the service industry for a longer time.I found the service of the staff unfriendly and in no way giving their guests a magical day. We were asking for directions and the staff will just point and say the name of the place. I know the name of the place, but I am expecting more details like turn left or right and when.... and in the midst of me still trying to get more details for direction, the girl went to answer the phone! I was so disgusted by this unfriendly and rude attitude. Disneyland definitely need to buck up on training for their staff.Another girl showed up to apologize, saying she was supposed to man the stand but comon, everyone wearing a Disneyland staff uniform should be helpful and not just because it is not her stand she can be so rude!Anyway, after experiencing the Disneyland in shanghai, I will just recommend everyone to forget the one in hongkong and go shanghai instead.",3
"I visited this place with less expectations.. and i did righti It has lot of offerings for kids, but very less for age of 30's. You may like few thrilling rides along with a good company.But vegetarian guys just be ready for fasting, since hardly you will get there something to eat.Anyways still there is something that you can enjoy.",3
Spent the day at HK Disneyland with 2 kids aged 10 and 14 at cost $380 just to get in the gate. There were some good 3D shows and roller coaster ride they enjoyed but found most rides more for younger kids. Food and drinks really expensive which we expected but $6 for a coke and $138HKD for a small curry and rice or $6 for a hotdog on a stick. Glad we only paid for a one day pass as did not consider it good value when also had to wait I ver an hour to get on some rides. Parade at 3pm was good. Not sure would bother going again.,3
We just got back from disneyland. And we were very disappointed. We expected a lot more rides for our age group but it was mostly for the kids. I guess if you are 30 . It's better to go to Ocean park.,3
"Went there as part of a family group so it wasdon't top of my pick though the child did enjoy it. Farcical entry method, we bought tickets on line and then proceeded to wait in line for half an hour or so. Various other problems resulting in a wait of 1 hour. Crowded place and difficult to battle your way through. Food expensive, basically you get ripped off. Very few places to sit down and watch the goings on. Saw two parades which were quite good but not the place I would go to again.",3
"The train ride from Sunny bay to Disneyland is worth taking. There is always a huge rush from the morning. Better to reach the park at 10 am. Book your tickets in advance to skip the queue. Evening parade and light show are never to be missed. Better to be seated at 5.30 pm as it becomes very crowded at 6.The live shows ( Lion king, etc), Mickey 3D show are worth watching. Fast pass is mainly for Meet and Greet characters. It is a small park if you compare with Orlando. Unlike Orlando, there is no free wifi inside the park Park timing can be increased to 7pm so that we cover 90% of the attraction ( rides, shows, etc) ",3
"Its good but quite kiddish. Its basically for kids below 12 years, not worth for teenagers. We visited it as my daughter diddon't want to leave Hongkong without visiting disneyland",3
"The smallest of all of the Disneyland resorts, this one doesdon't boast many 'high speed thrilling' rides   more ones for 5 10 year olds. (if you want rollercoasters, head to ocean park). Tickets are quite expensive and good luck if you think you can leave without taking something home from the extensive gift shops! For little ones, this is great and would be a really lovely family day out. Bring cash, a small bag, an umbrella and your own drinks if you can. My favourite parts   The River cruise, The runaway mine cars and the toy story blaster ride.",3
"Quite disappointing! Everything is about queuing!! Not much characters is out to roam around. Queue to take pictures with one Mickey took us almost 2 hours. Disneyland should be the happiest place on earth but it become unhappy for us n the kids! If u been to the Disneyland in US, save ur time to do other stuff! ",3
"Pricing of Hong Kong Disneyland from 16 December 2016 increased from original HK$539 to HK$589 adult; then chirdren's tickets increased from HK$385 to HK$419 whereas elderly ticket remains unchanged at HK$100. Personally not recommended, it costs already HK$1,597 if you are a family of 3 people. (2 adults and one child) plus. the food inside Disneyland is not cheap.",3
"My husband is an avid fan of Disney theme parks. We have been fortunate enough to visit all of the parks except for Shanghai. Hong Kong has its charms, but it is difficult to compare it to the other, much larger parks. One day is plenty to do everything. In fact, we diddon't need an entire day. We visited in July. Pros:   Mystic Manor and Grizzly Gulch, both are rides not found at other parks. They are well done and fun.   No crowds   no wait times  Location is easy to get toCons:  July is HOT in Hong Kong  Many of the restaurants and extra attractions were closed  Small",3
"All that you would expect from a Disney World, but on a much smaller scale. Spending half a day here is enough. Well connected with public transport for just about HKG$30.00. Staff not as cheerfull and friendly as in sister parks in the US.",3
This would be a great day out for 3   6 year olds if they had never been to an amusement park. Our 10 and 7 year old were not that excited about the place and I did expect a few more thrilling rides than there were. Hyperspace was good and at least you could get a time to return to ride rather than wait in the queue. Several of the rides were closed and the Ironman one hasdon't opened yet. The boys enjoyed being on the Jedi Training and getting to fight Darth Vader but all in all when asked if they would like to go back they said  No .,3
"Completed all the rides within a day. There are 7 Small themed park and the most  exciting  ride would be  Runaway Mine Car . Those popular rides that you could get a FastPass wasdon't needed during our weekday trip.    Must do   all performances and parades are excellent!! Mickey & the Wondurous Book, especially Festival of The Lion King(amazing production), and please stay back for the fireworks(best place to watch fireworks and story projection will be in front of the Sleeping Beauty Castle). Go for your desired rides first while scheduling performances in between. Leave those common rides to last.    Mustdon't do   Go ladies' toilets(will be Long queue) after parades or fireworks. Check out counters for gift shops also fully packed by then too.    Best mode of transport to Disneyland   MTR (simple & economical). Do buy an Octopus cards that could store value and refund balanced amount including card deposit (but will charge a small admin fee) upon leaving HK at airport train station.    English are commonly used even for performance.     Food wasdon't reasonably cheap   eg candy floss goes approx. USD4. You are not allowed to BYO food.    Some rides have height restriction but generally all rides are kid friendly.    Selfie stick or monopod are not allowed.    Even the most timid person could enjoyed most of the rides. Waiting for new attraction Ironman in Jan2017.We had visited twice and frankly it needs more themed attractions and expand those existing ones else it's going to lose visitors to Ocean Park.On the other hand, we do enjoyed the performances and shows... so dodon't miss it!",3
The last parade is a spectacular light and sound show. With the characters the magic of Disney is rekindled which was somewhat lost in the day. The new Star Wars hyperspace mountain is impressive. I shall not spoil the fun for you. We like the grizzly bear roller coaster the most. It's filled with more surprises. ,3
"Dont Go unless you have a toddler with you, above 10 years kids get really bored here, the cartoon characters and rides are all mostly toddlers who get amazed looking at ferries and cartoon characters, if you are a group of adults I suggest go to Ocean Park",3
"After visiting Disneyland Paris and The Universal Studios in Singapore, Disneyland Hong Kong was not so great. The attractions are mainly for kids and even the 'most extreme' are never so exciting. Some of them were under maintenance and the 'soldier parachute' was still being tested at 12.00pm which is unacceptable for those who pay a 1 day ticket.The worst was Star Wars attraction which is basically nothing compared to the Transformers attraction at the Universal Studios. They only used some projections and lights, no high speed, no 3D or 4D effects!If you want to take a picture with Disney characters you have to queue for longtime..why dodon't they hire more staff to represent Disney characters and let them walk around so everybody can have the chance to take a pic?? At Disneyland Paris we took a lot of pics and the characters walked around at any time! I love Disney world but I think this Disneyland should definitely improve.",3
"I finally made it to a Disney attraction after 43 years and thankfully nephew and niece made it fun. It was a fun day out and wish we had longer to take in more. The only downside is the price. Overpriced entrance fee and food was way too expensive,   23 for burger, chips and deeps fried prawns with chips. Mc Donald's make a better burger for a fraction of the price. ",3
"Comparing experiences from Paris and Tokyo Disneyland:Atmosphere is duller compared to Paris and Tokyo. It would be nice to be able to see a list of all the character meet and greets somewhere on the website. Go on a non public holiday, school holiday to miss the crowds. We went during the week on a Thursday, rides were also abit of a wait (30 1hr) For a family with a toddler this is hard. There is a fastpass but with a toddler only 2 of these rides are applicable.It was warm, there were little shade for some of the rides when queuing up. Ended up only going on 4 rides as we wanted to see the parade at 3pm and some of the theatre shows. One of the theatre shows was half Cantonese and half English. Micky speaking Cantonese just doesdon't cut it for me. Maybe for some it might.Shops and Disney paraphilia is good. I'm a bit shocked at the lack of beautiful Christmas decorations on sale, it was a little depressing to see that compared to our visit at the same time in December to Paris, where there were walls of beautiful Christmas decorations.Cons:UHT milk on sale at some food vendors but not coldFood is not tasty, a little disgusting compared to typical foods you can get in Hong Kong. it was also expensive for what you get.",3
Having been to other Disneyland locations  HK Disneyland is great for young kids but not preteens or teens. There are 4 exciting rides   of which 2 were closed for renovation. Many things were closed such as restaurants and eating stands. And the facility is old. The merchandise here is fairly boring and repetitive. Shows are highly recommended though  and worth watching (regardless of age). Food is decent. And take note of the hoards of tourists   as they might get rowdy during parades and closing time. Parades are really fun to watch and the staff are generally quite friendly and helpful. Would not recommend  it's a small world   dodon't bother and visit other parts of the theme park instead. ,3
"all the hype you hear about Disneyland, I was disappointed, maybe because its not the biggest Disneyland in the world, I was expecting a lot more rides and activities, but I did cross it off my bucket list, and what was there was good and enjoyable ",3
Easy to get to you must stay for the parade  the food was good mainly for kids under 12 yo Go to Ocean Park its great for the whole family,3
"I went to the Disney world in Tokyo and LA., which you can stay few days for these two, but for the Hong Kong one, sorry to tell you that you can finish it in 3 to 4 hours. It is extremely small and the worst is the Cinderella castle, they scare it down to a smaller scale which make it looks really ridiculous. If you had never been to a Disney world, well you can give it a go, but if you tried other Disney world, dodon't bother and go to ocean park please",3
"After our arrival in Hong Kong, we went to Disneyland and it was a nice experience. We arrived there at 11am and did all attraction until 6pm. For groups it is perfect, even when the amount of thrilling attractions is not too huge, beside the 2 rollercoasters there are only a few other funny attractions. For kids it is perfect and they will really enjoy it. There are a lot of attractions for kids and it is totally worth it, to check out the promotions online, before you go there.",3
You can sense the disney magic but if you've every been to other Disney Parks this is just a little guy.... limited number rides.  Not a multi day experience.  Glad I went... wodon't do it again.,3
First I must say I love Disney. Hong Kong Disney has the Disney feel and it wasdon't crowded. This Disney park is very small and it caters to children 12 and under. There aredon't any attractions for older children such as roller coasters and other fast rides. I walked around for 2 1 2 hours and rode the subway back to the hotel. I'm glad I went to Hong Kong Disney. ,3
"It is amazing how dated and run down the Disney brand has become.  Having visited DL in Paris, Florida and California I can say with certainty that this is the least enjoyable. It laxks the sparkle that the others do and is quite jaded.",3
"Of course there is another surprise. Eat half the breakfast may be a  good friend  to say hello to you. Super invincible can not resist their lovely appearance  incidentally, we return to Taiwan that day, breakfast is in our live Disney Hollywood hotel downstairs,  Mickey chef restaurant  dining. Their breakfast buffet is also very good drops! After eating, into the Disneyland Hello. Because the weather is not very good, so today 's tourists did not yesterday. Lucky should be the first stop is here, is located in the fantasy world of  Mitch Fantasia.  It is a 3D small theater. Not only the screen is realistic 3D, you can smell the aroma of cake and champagne, even my sense of smell are ultra slow to have smelled ah (moved). I suggest you do not sit too in front, in addition to halo will go outside to know my pains!Although the film is not long, but I personally feel very worth a look! Originally thought that the protagonist will be Mickey, did not think turned out to be Donald Duck !! This makes me break glasses ah!",3
Many China tourists everywhere..I went on a Hot & sunny day and the heat was almost unbearable with not much shelters around. Only go if u are a Disney fan or want to bring ur kids. Most of the rides are quite kiddy and family friendly. Be prepared to spend a full day there. Limited and expensive food choices compared to the rest of hk. Very touristy.,3
I absolutely love Disney and have been to Disney World Florida on many occasions. As we lived in HK we thought we would go to the local ..... We were quite disappointed as it is small and not that many great rides. Also though it was expensive. I guess we were spoilt with just how good the Florida one is .... I would save and go the the US instead....,3
"We went to Disney with our 22 months granddaughter and her parents. We diddon't go with any expectations as we understand from various review that there's no comparison with any other Disneys. It's good that we had this mindset because apart from the size of the park, there wasdon't much Disney atmosphere. The exception was the parade which was one of the highlight. It shows that if they tried, they could capture the much needed Disney atmosphere. Anyhow, our granddaughter had a good time and that's good enough for us.",3
"Was expecting more fireworks from the whole Disney experience! Long queues with no premium passes to bypass them was a bummer.. also there were literally no live characters that the kids got a chance to see..they were soo disappointed!!! The parade was the saving grace.. what a visual treat it was, and we were glad we stayed back. Another plus and a hidden gem was the vegetarian Indian thali we chanced upon, as we were told theres very few veg option.. super happy to get decent Indian food.It needs better attractions, as most r ides felt repetitive in each zone.",3
There was actually very little there  a few of the Disney classics but not too much else. It was an interesting visit but diddon't require a lot of time. Several attractions were closed during my visit.,3
This would be a great disney experience for families with small children as there are lots of character photo ops and park is fairly compact.After visiting Disneyworld and Disneyland this was a bit of a let down. Very quiet and lacks the atmosphere of its American parks.Shopping is very limited and repetitive in every shop.,3
"If you are a traveler with only few days to spend in Hong Kong and if you ever been to Disneyland in other country, there is basically no reason for you to waste a day here.Disneyland Hong Kong is small... so small that on weekdays, if you arrived when the park opens, you can basically finish most of the best ride before noon. Sure, the shows are good (Lion King is still one of the best show) but there is just nothing special that makes you want to stay anytime longer. With the recent price increase, I do not think is a worth the time and money to visit. (I think the money is better spend on foods in Hong Kong)",3
"This was a great way to spend a day. Not as exciting as it's America counterpart, not really exhilarating rides here. There are a few good rides. Not as big as the USA Disney land. No need for lockers as you can take you belongings with you. ",3
"This is my 4th Disneyland (after LA, Orlando & Tokyo). This time of the bring not a peak season, is a good time visit Disneyland. Crowd manageable, most rides max 5 10mins waiting time, not too crowded watching the parades, weather not cold Nor hot. Managed to complete 80% of all rides, shows and Parks by 3pm. Only setbacks were most restaurants were not open and staff not very friendly. This Disneyland is not very big compared to the 3 others which I had visited. Also most rides are suitable for the younger ones.",3
"A bit ordinary, not up to other Disneylands, OK for younger children. Pick a cool day, the weather can be quite oppresive given it is a long day probably with kids.",3
"a friend of mine told me that i need to visit Disneyland if i have the time in Hong Kong. i was expecting a big park but however it doesnt meet my expectation. i arrived there around 11am and there was a long queue for their ticket. after lining up around 20 minutes, i finally got my ticket. although its small, the crowd is still manageable. i enjoyed watching mickey magic show and also their stitch program. i might be coming back if only im with travelling with small kids. by the way, selfie stick is not allowed in the park. i brought one with me but i didnt use it in the park. before their checkup point, just put it in your bag as they will do a fast spot check and they might missed while looking for it.",3
Fun to visit this small theme park especially if you like Disney and have kids. Reasonably easy to travel to the theme park. Please be prepared to queue for all the rides and photo taking booth.,3
My mistake. I went with big hope of having high thrill rides with big drops and upside down rides. To my surprise it was mainly for small children only and a couple of rides for parents to keep them un bored. Restaurant options are very limited i would say with the scale of name this place has achieved. Overall the theme is catered to shell out as much money from parents as possible to please their children by selling products Mickey branded. ,3
We are very well travelled Disney goers and would say this park is definitely targeted at younger families. Whilst Main Street and the lands much the same this park misses the rides for the big kids in us all. But We ticked the box.,3
"Not like the Disneyland in Tokyo, which is also good for young people, I would think the HK one is much smaller and for children only.",3
"I have visited California Disney 2 times before in 2007 and 2010. This was our 3rd time to visit Disneyland but first time to go to Disney outside the USA. For the first time also I was taking my 6 year old daughter to a Disney park. She is a big fan of Elsa and Anna just like many girls :), and loves all Disney characters, knows their stories etc. Ok, Let me share some of my disappointments first   1. One thing we found missing was the courtesy in the staff at Disneyland HK towards visitors. There were less of helpers and more of process follower or policing staff in Disney land and this was something I have not observed in Disneyland resort earlier. Smiling and greeting attitude was missing in staff. It may be an ethnic or regional thing, as Chinese people seemed to be a bit rude in general (personal feeling, not to generalize).2. My daughter wanted to meet her favorite Disney characters but unfortunately she could not do. It was too much of time standing in the queues in the efforts to get a picture with them, but they do not even stop to allow taking a picture with them unlike in California. After standing in a queue for 2 hrs we could not meet Mickey and Minnie. I and my daughter just stepped out of Queue to get some food as she was hungry, but my wife was keeping our place in the queue, but when her turn came quicker than we thought and we got late to return just for 2 mins. we missed them once again :(. They could not wait on my wife's request as they said it was closing time for them (it was 6pm whereas park closes at 8pm). I immediately visited their guest services to request to allow just one picture with my daughter, but the reply I got was pretty cold  not possible sir .3. Overall the park is smaller in comparison with USA ones. but similarly ticket is also much lower than US; so it was NOT a disappointment. Now the good things  1. Ticket Price is very competitive. With the usual cost of everything in Hongkong, this is pretty decent price to spend a day with your family with experience of Disneyland.2. Travel easiness; with wonderful MTR network directly taking you to park, it is actually very convenient going to Disneyland from any part of the hongkong city.",3
"Strangely empty, a handful of rides and not the friendliest cast members made this a one and done Disney experience",3
"But not like the ones in the USA.  Hong Kong is smaller and thus disappointed me, but if have not been before it is a great place for kids and adults.  (I did miss the turkey legs)",3
"This is not my first Disneyland. I've also been to Disney in Orlando and also Universal Studios and I remember those as being fun even if I went there when I was already 27. But this Disney is smaller and the rides are less   scary and thrilling. It really is a wonderland for kids. My 12 year old niece enjoyed it but me, not as much. Also, when you watch the festival of lights, if ou cadon't go near from the center, better to be at the center even if you are far away. That way, you can still see the fireworks. We decided to go near but at the side and was only able to see once part of the castle, the other part was blocked from view.",3
"Too many people from mainland China diddon't follow the queue and it was very crowded. But the services and staff were nice, willing to help me on some directions and answered me politely. Only the problem is a bit small and too crowded. It is not worth to that expensive tickets. The MTR to there was cute and nice.",3
"Disneyland HK feels like a quite compact park. It is a while since I've visited Disneyland Paris and Disney World Orlando and this feels much more designed for small children than the other parks. The park is also small and I think you can plan to do it in half a day. With small children maybe a bit longer.Some attractions are in Chinese only, so understanding what the characters are saying might be a problem.They close most of the attractions very early, already when the parade starts at 7PM, thus dodon't come too late to the park.Western food is not especially good, tried a hot dog and will never do that again. Very tasteless and strange consistency. There are a lot of Asian style options, maybe they taste better? Have to try next time.Anyhow Disney is always fun and there are some attractions that are quite well suited for adults too e.g. Grizzly Gulch and Hyperspace Mountain.",3
"I suppose if i was into this type of thing I may have enjoyed it more, but I was here accompanying my brother's family and they seemed to have a good time. Queues for rides were horrendous and there was no screening from the oppressive heat when in the queues. Sure there is plenty to see and do but the place was so busy it made it hard to appreciate all that was on offer. Food and drink are ridiculously priced which is disappointing. The staff are all very helpful and friendly as I suppose they have to be. Highlight would have to be the evening parade.",3
"Took the family to HK Disneyland earlier this month and while the crowd was manageable this time on a Sunday visit, we were a bit disppointed with some of the programs. The traditional 3pm parade was rather short. The usual characters were there   Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald, etc. but the princesses weredon't and neither were other more recent characters. The attractions and rides were great and we did get to meet Chewbacca and R2D2 in Tomorrowland, so that was a consolation.",3
"To fully appreciate and enjoy disneyland, i suggest you to allocate an entire day for this place. Come as early as 9am and stay until the firework display finishes. Disneyland offers numerous attractions and rides where long queues are inevitable. So to save yourself from stress, it would be better to take your time and to take it easy. You will thank yourself for being patient at the end of the day. To be honest, the whole experience for me was a bit underwhelming because I coulddon't help myself but compare my experience at Ocean Park the day before. I love animals and extreme rides that disneyland doesdon't offer. Also, disneyland doesdon't have views like where the seas meet the mountains that ocean park has. Meanwhile, there were things I enjoyed at disneyland that are unique from ocean park. In November 2015, disneyland's musical production was Lion King at that time. I loved every bit of it. I love musicals and all the songs of this musical. It was the closest experience I had to a Broadway production. On the other hand, there was a ride called Space Mountain that I thought was unforgettable. Me and my brothers even did it again twice as it was just so fun. It wasdon't as big as the roller coaster at ocean park but it offered a different experience for us. It was a mini roller coaster inside a building that looked like a futuristic mountain from the outside. It felt like we were in the galaxy where it was dark but we could see bright lights like they were stars. As it was dark, every unexpected turn or curve was exhilirating and the galactic music synced with the coaster's speed just sealed the deal for me. It was my favorite ride at Disneyland. Even before coming to disneyland, I always knew that there would be a float parade. It was one of the much awaited attractions for me. We even left the queues just to witness the parade. It was like a celebration. The float parade brought out the kid in me. Most if not all classic disney characters were brought to life that left me smiling the whole time. Lastly, before we left disneyland, we also witnessed the fireworks display. It wasdon't the best I've seen but the audio visual presentation in the foreground made all the difference.As a conclusion, if you love musicals, parades, and disney mascots, and you are fine with less intense but creative rides, then Disneyland might just be the perfect theme park for you!",3
"Super easy and cheap to get to by the dedicated train, the usual gift shops, not many 'rides' although the big grizzly mountain and the parachute ride from Toy Story were a scream!! I diddon't think we would spend more than a couple of hours but actually arrived at 10 and left at about three. It was quiet when we went (on a Friday) so the queues were bearable in the heat. We were In Hong Kong for ten nights so it was a day trip but if there for less I'm not sure it would be high on my priorities",3
This park isdon't as nice as the one in Japan Anaheim Paris Orlando or Shanghai. It's smaller and lacks the charm of the others. Not as many places to eat and frankly it's a little boring.  The staff is friendly however.,3
Parks should have limitation on the capacity of what the park can hold. I cant believe we stood for 1 and a half hour outside the park just to get inside under the hot sun. Inside the park. you can barely see the park attendants. no one is there to assist you. all the rides are still the same compared to when I last went there when I was just a kid. It seems like they made no effort to change the rides except to change the name of the rides depending what cartoon is trending.Place is small and crowded. It was supposed to be a magical exprience for us. But now. I will never go back here again,3
"We chose a one day tour with a local company, 10.30 hotel pick up and return after the evening fireworks. It turned out to be a very long day for two more  mature  adults. The weather was hot and very humid. Plenty to amuse the kids but less of interest to us. The park was not very busy and popular rides generally had only small queues so we manged to do what we wanted with plenty of time to spare. 4 to 5 hours would have been enough. Food and drink is quite expensive, and you cadon't get a cold beer, at least not where we ate.",3
This Disneyland isdon't much if you're looking for a theme park with rides. Most of them were rides I think only children under 5 would enjoy apart from the three thrill rides! The lion king show was great however the way they had people queuing seemed dangerous as when they put the rope down people were running and pushing passed each other. I woulddon't recommend it to adults and I'm a big Disney fan. Skip this one and go to a better Disneyland.,3
"Disappointing fireworks show. Nothing special here, I prefer other Disneyland than this one in Hong Kong. A lot of people cutting queues and shoving around.",3
Very clean and no long lines for rides. A little sterile and very few characters so not a lot of life very good for small children but not teenaged looking for a thrill  even a little boring. Worth a trip to say you've been but not like it's sister version in LA ,3
We would not recommend to spend time at the Disney in Hong Kong if you have visited the disneyland in Paris and the US.The Visitors are rude and don`t follow the line concept. we were surprised that some of they just keep pushing to jump the line.Horrible experience. ,3
"It's a Mini Disneyland.... expect the prices of food and souvenir items are a bit high... I enjoy our trip there though it's so hot and tiring(coz we just arrived in HK when we go there)... Disneyland, however small or big it is, is truely enjoyable ;) ",3
"Went on a Monday, so wasdon't all that crowded. Could be a great time for kids and those who've never had the Disney experience, but could be a disappointment for those who've done Anaheim. The food is mediocre and expensive, but that's to be expected. Some of the attractions were in Cantonese only, so us English speakers were left wondering, but again, that's to be expected. ",3
If this is your first trip to Disney you will enjoy this place. If you have been to Florida La you will be disappointed as so small in comparison. Really easy to get to. Mtr takes you to the door. Tickets reasonable. We got a discount via our hotel. Paid 443hk$ each. Spent time wandering around and then joined the Jedi training session. This was funny to watch. Lots of young kids getting taught how to fight the bad guys. We even had a visit from Darth Vader himself! The park was quiet when we visited on. Monday morning in September. We diddon't queue for anything! Nice day out. ,3
the ticket price for Disney is so expensive i researched that the tickets in Hong Kong are more expensive than Paris Disneyland which is ridiculous as in Paris there are more attraction and more rides compared to Hong Kong Disney. however overall a good place to visit with the kids.,3
"Good place for a day out for children.But when compared to Disney Land in other places, this one seems to be quite small.Still had the regular entertainments and is good for a first timer.The lion king show was excellent.Recommended to carry water bottles from outside, as it is quite expensive to buy inside.",3
"My daughter and her friend visited earlier this year and as they are both 16 they were looking forward to trying out the more challenging rides. However, to their disappointment, only Hyperspace Mountain was open, as the Big Grizzly Mountain runaway cars was closed. Whilst I do accept that maintenance is required this was on a very busy Saturday in July so it was rather annoying to pay over   50 for a ticket and not be able to experience the bigger rides. As a result they came out of the park earlier than planned as the queues for the other rides were very long. There needs to be more of the big rides to balance out the queues for the younger ages rides.",3
"I am a Disneyland rookie. Never been to one. The only cool worldclass theme park I ve been was Universal Studio Singapore and that was amaaaazing.Disneyland shows and characters were great. I enjoed the ride, parade, characters, the merchandise and food. Love them!. However my expectation of being at the so called happiest place on earth were somehow let down by rude park crews. They have very average command of English, bad at problem solving and just plain rude. Maybe because they were unable to express themselves properly because of language but I snapped more during that visit to HK than any other days while I was in HK. Irony.Putting that aside, people will still enjoy the park (minus park crews). HK Disneyland, improve your park crews please.And people, if you do have the means or extra money, give this park a skip and go to other Disneyland (Japan, Paris, US).",3
"There is not much for adults to enjoy. I was a bit disappointed. I felt Grizzly Glutch is the best part of disney land. Getting vegetarian food could be a challenge. it is a full day activity. Universal Studio, Singapore and Ferari World Abudhai in my view are better. Paint the night parade and fireworks at night is worth a watch.",3
"We allowed a full day for this, getting to the park nice and early. We needdon't have rushed   it's so small it really doesdon't take very long to get round the whole park. The up side is that means you can take things a bit slower knowing that you'll still get to see everything. ",3
The park is easy to get to and all the rides are well maintained and fun. The park is not Florida but is bigger then you think and has attractions for all the family. The parade is great and equals many of the ones in other parks. The number of eating places are numerous but are quite expensive. Not all the restaurants were open when we visited. It does get hot and humid and there is no water sprays or cooling areas. ,3
"We only had Wednesday afternoon evening to devote to Disneyland and worried that it woulddon't be enough time but as this really is only a very small mini park it was plenty of time. The longest we waited for a ride was 15mins and that was in Toy Story Land waiting for the Slinky Dog Spin which once we got on lasted for around a minute. Most of the other rides we simply walked right on and even ran back around and did them again as there was hardly anyone around.You dodon't have to stay at the resort but of course you will have to add travel time to your day. We caught the MTR to Sunny Bay (Tung Chung line) and then changed to the Disneyland Resort line which is a bit of fun as the Disney train has Mickey Mouse windows, Mickey ear handles to hold on to and small statues of characters in the train.There are basically 3 thrill rides in the park   RC Racer, Hyperspace Mountain and Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars and even then they aredon't that scary. The rest are cute family style rides like Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh & Jungle Cruise which are still fun just dodon't expect it to be like Disneyland USA. There are actually not that many rides in the park which is why we were able to get through them all, instead there's a real emphasis on meeting characters. One thing here is that they close the rides an hour before the park closes and the train closed at 6pm which is a shame so make sure you have done all the rides you want and then shop in the stores while you wait for the fireworks which are best viewed from Main Street facing the castle.A fun few hours and if you had small kids it would probably be a great day out but I'm not sure how people spend more than a day here.",3
Went to Disneyland HK with my son and mum in August. There was a lot of people and the weather is very hot.The queues to all rides were at least 20 mins. As the weather is very hot there were some areas in the park that had a lacking of trees   shade which made it tough to stay there for long. Example the toystoryland There was no proper sitting area to watch the fireworks at night so most people especially the ones in front had to sit on the road which was scorching hot from the sun earlier in the day. It was still radiating of heat at nightQuality of food was not great that the theme park especially those covered by the hotel park package. The Dim sums at Plaza Inn near the main street was good. The wanton noodles at Chopin food festival was bad. Photo plus option for tourists was really good to allow visitors to download professional photos with the characters later at their own time.Toilets were surprisingly clean which I was very happy with.Overall it might be the weather that spoilt it for me but I wasdon't overly impressed with the HK Disneyland. ,3
"We had our company team building amazing race session here. It's nice. For kids. For adult or young adult looking for fun extreme adrenaline pumping rides, you wont find it here. But you can definitely take few decent pictures there.",3
"Avoid going during summer. It's so hot, you will not be able to enjoy the place.The only things you get to take during the day period are umbrellas and more umbrellas.There are not many sheltered area aside from the gift shops and restaurants.Unlike Tokyo Disneyland, we have to queue to take pictures with all the characters.Much time wasted.Except for Mickey and Minnie near the main gate and others in designated enclosures, I see that the other characters only come out for a short period of time and the staff closes the queue quite fast.Signs are unclear. We followed a sign to Toy Story Land but could not find the place and when we asked a staff, she told us that the other direction was nearer. As there was no other signs along the way, we could not find Toy Story Land at all.",3
"I remember the place more for the company i was with. Despite the rainy weather we had a fun time. Compared to the other Disney resorts i have visited this was ok. As it is still new i am sure they will improv and make it a more interesting place. The place has potential. Highlight was that you can find many eating places, chinese, halal, malaysian, indian etc. Reasonably priced. Entrance tickets were expensive considering there were not as many rides and entertainment. Due to the rainy weather we did not see the full parade. Public Transport to and from Disneyland is very easy and cheap. Is alright if you want a kids day out.",3
"Visiting hong kong disneyland was nice but it was not very special. euro disneyland is bigger and weather way better near Paris. The day we visited hongkong disneyland was very hot and humid. The only special thing was the train taking people to the park. It has disneyland logo everywhere, from the windows to everything inside. the kids love it.",3
"We'd never done any kind of Disney land before,so we thought we'd go to make our grandchildren jealous when we got home. It has been done very well,the entrance is the most impressive part. There are lots of rides suitable for children who are younger,I think teenagers would stick to the two rollercoasters( we did both) as they have the biggest thrills. This said there were no really big rides that impress the eye and bring out the dare devil in you. Glad we went   55 a bit steep(   9.00) a ride for us. Youngsters would love it .",3
"The Hong Kong Disney is rather small compared to the Orlando one. Our 10 year old did not complain about walking from one attraction to another because they are right next to each other. Waiting time wasdon't too bad. Since we got there early and did the hyper space mountain ride and the buzz lightyear first we diddon't use any fast pass. Theme park staffs was polite. We bought the admission tickets from one website and received a small discount. We bought the meals vouchers from the entrance for lunch, dinner and a snack. It was a good deal. Food portion was big. We should have bought just three in stead of four because we coulddon't finish the food. One thing I diddon't like was that it was difficult to look for a table to dine. You MUST find a table before buying food. No one cleans up after they eat so the table was dirty until the staff removed the trays and wiped the table clean. I have to give credit to the staffs because they work extremely hard to keep the park clean and tidy. Despite this, Hong Kong Disney is noisier and dirtier compared to Orlando's. ",3
"Nice spot, but small. If you are used to Disney World in Florida, this is quite tiny. My family, with young teenagers, had enough after about 3 hours one afternoon. Space Mountain and some rollercoaster (name escapes me) is all they really loved. Cadon't comment on smaller kid rides. But clean and Disney ish for sure. If you want bigger, I am told the new park in Shanghai is the place to go.",3
"Hard to compare Disney's as I know this is a smaller one but it really was a bit of a disappointment for the family. There was no real feel of Disney magic and seemed far more quick & commercial than say Paris, Anaheim or Florida. Definitely worth a visit if you are staying for quite a few days as the kids will still love it. It is very reasonable in price for tickets. There were a few disappointments including no area for us to cool off from the humidity and heat. Also the fans in most of the queues were not switched on which also made the heat unbearable. Food was very average and variety not ideal.",3
"Very good decorations, our kid loved parade and the firework. However had some poor organized moments. 1. You should be to queue a loooot. Like from 10am till 8.20 we just managed to get into 5 attractions and took a photo with Mickie. If you want to eat, again... And if you want to find a sit you should be lucky to fine one. Why not to make electronic queueing system? Considering that ticket is not cheap. 2. The tropical sun is to strong to handle. Would be good to have some shades. For train they made us to queue outside the roof covered area referring to instruction. So eventually after a long day you feel exhausted and realize that you missed the feeling of magic at all. Because thats why people usually go there for I think. ",3
"Decided to do HKG disney as last minute decision...Park is small.. as per all the other reviews   spent maybe a good 4 hours here. Space mountain is all star wars themed at the moment. Mystic point which is a purely built for HKG was amazing   such a unique attraction and made it worth visiting the park.. Favourite ride was the runaway mine cart ( this also had a single rider line   maybe the only one in the park??) If looking for disney stuff in the shops, dodon't hold your breath too much... its not 'disney' disney in terms of heaps of mickey and donald and goofy etc.. had more zootopia, big hero 6 and other disney toys . Which made it feel more like a giant toy shop than a disney store.   had your t shirts and mugs as well though.Didnt really see any characters around the park, Did see MIckey as was exiting at main square though... wasnt really looking, but wasdon't really advertised either.All in all   was glad I went, but wouldnt go to this park again. They need at least another 3 lands and more than 1 main rider per land to make it great.",3
"I'm still unsure about how I feel about visiting Disneyland Hong Kong. I liked it because I love Disney, there were really cute kids clothes and cheap. So lots of shops to buy Disney souvenirs. It's very exciting walking along the really long entrance towards the gate with a fabulous Mikey surfing   which I thought strange in Hong Kong but cool nevertheless. The castle was disappointing compared to USA but then again you cadon't expect the exact same thing, so I could deal with that. I just diddon't get the Disney kid feeling in my gut! The parade was pretty spectacular, we all loved that. My kids thought it was great but got over it pretty quick! The rides kept closing due to fear of lightning or storms and with the size of the queues the kids said they wanted to leave. No real exciting rides really. No express passes to jump the queue either! You could get them for individual rides if busy but no express queue. We tried to get lunch and that was another effort   no theme park type food available most places were closed and we waited in line to a restaurant which had a bazaar menu and no tables to sit at. So we had fairy floss for lunch! So to some up if your in Hong Kong give it a go for something to do! But dodon't compare to other parks as you will be disappointed! Go enjoy a bit of Disney!!",3
It's Disney! Die sind reason it's not as good as the US one but it's a great way to spend all day to wear out the kids if you are in Hong Kong. The prices are so much be. I think it was close to $60 vice $100 in California. go early and go to the back of the park first. We went around 1030 and went by the small world attraction. We got sidetracked by our kids a few times but when we got to the small world about 30 mins later there still was no line! ,3
"Although name is big but could not find anything great , many parks are better even in India . Food is pathetic also they dodon't allow any food to be carried inside . Like a Black mail to buy and have bad food at exhobirent price inside . Food for Indians is bad .",3
"Hong Kong Disney is well known as the smallest one comparison to all others in the world. Though it's the smallest one, the kids still felt excited to visit it and diddon't mind waiting in line to play the rides in the resort. It was a pity that the rides with fast pass were not enough. Also, when you got the one fast pass ticket, you were not allowed to take another almost until you finished the original one. However, I think it will not be difficult to arrange one program to make the fast pass better in my humble ideas.",3
"Hong Kong Disneyland is a fun place, but it's mostly dedicated to kids (age 4 14 I would say). As a twenty something year old, I diddon't find it as awesome and amusing as I was hoping, considering the fact, that day earlier I visited the Hong Kong Ocean Park. If you are thinking over whether to go to Ocean Park or to Disneyland, I would suggest to go to Ocean Park, as the attractions there are in my opinion way better (you can see PANDA bears, ride with thrilling rollercoasters, explore different sea animals and so on).",3
"Most important thing is to never visit this place during the summer and if you do, do not forget to get your umbrellas and fans. They do sell them inside Disneyland but they are 4 times the cost. The place is ideal for families with kids. There are just about 4 rides suitable for adults. Young couples may rather visit ocean park.",3
"It's nothing like Paris or Florida, it is much smaller. I got bored quite quickly as we had gone around the whole park fairly quickly. We found to be stuck in ride queues for ages! We were in the toy story queue for approx 1 hour and 30 mins and as we turned the corner we realised we were nowhere near the start of the ride!! So we gave up and left. ",3
"Where to start. The park is clean and easy to wander around and typical Disney fantasy. If you're looking for thrill rides this isdon't the place with only 4 so so thrill rides. More suited to the younger kids than teens or adults looking for action like the Aneheim Disney.The street parade is a revisited child hood and was very good. Anouncements are given in Cantonese and EnglishEasy to get to once to work out the MTR $28.50HK to get there and $534HK for adult entry. The park had a no selfie stick policy which they dodon't enforce and they have dmoking areas behind a screen so if you walk by you still get second hand smoke. What they should have is a no mobile policy. Never have encountered any where in the world an culture so self absorbed pushy and rude. Park visitors cadon't walk around without their noses in mobiles, so they walk into people, hold up lines, push in front of you and watch out for how they also wield umbrellas if you value your eye sight. We were feed up by days end having to deal with such self centred behaviour. It was a real dampner on the day. If the mobile meet work went down they woulddon't know how to cope. Why go to Disneyland if you're going to spend the day looking at your mobile. Take your own food and drinks or you'll end up broke or have someone push into you while you're trying to get out the exit line balancing your tray and risk loosing the lot over someone. Disneyland is a great concept its the visitors that spoil it by their behaviour.",3
I have been here before and it was just not the same. The crowds are much bigger and the wait is too long. There are no trees so there is no shelter from the hot sun! The staff are not as friendly as they used to be and they did not try to understand that the temperatures were high and they could easily have hurried the pace between rides if they managed it properly. Also they never filled up all the rides and a lot of rides had only two or three people where 4 or 5 could easily have gone. The only good thing was they had a fast tract where you could punch your ticket and were given a time to come back for that particular ride. Though the time given was 4 or 5 hours after it still meant that we did not have to wait under the hot sun.The parade only starts at 7:30 PM and the light show at 9 PM!!!We were there from 1000 AM and there was no way our children could stay awake that late.They should look at having these two much earlier.,3
Huge place to explore with many interesting spot. Have great memories in this place. Do purchase your ticket earlier because you wont want to line up with long queue at the ticket counter.,3
Fun little park. There are 2 disney hotels located on the park. A bit expensive although one is cheaper than the other. The park offers all the Disney characters and a beautiful parade and fireworks in the evening. We spend 2 days 1 night. This was more than enough! Good time had by all! ,3
"I had great expectations of Disneyland, this being my first visit to a Disney Park. I've been to Universal Studios Singapore before and was enthralled by it. Somehow, Hong Disneyland doesdon't match up to that. Is it the energy levels or the lack of cool sound effects? Somehow, it fell a tad short of my expectation. But hey, its still a Disney Park and a fun way to spend your day. Do check out the cool shows, the Mickey shaped waffles at Main Street USA and do not miss the night parade with Alladin's  I can show you the world  theme, its truly magical!",3
A real disappointment. It has couple downs in my view:1. It searches customers bags for food! We thought it's for security but turned out they search your hand bags coz too many Chinese bring in food to avoid rip offs. Felt really bad that they worry more about their profits than our safety!2. A total rip off  we were encouraged by Disney Hollywood at check out counter to bring our bags with us to use the luggage locker  service  in Disney. Turned out its a HK$90 piece  service . A guy in front of us has a glass bottle of water. The  security  forced him to put it in a locker n paid HK$90. Not to mention food n drinks there are 4 5 times more than market prices.3. Dirtiest restrooms: you can smell them miles away. Toilet seats r worn with footprints. I understand there have been tons of Chinese tourists but the management can at least clean them more frequently.4. Terrible service: It rained heavily one hour before Lion King show. All rides were closed. Tons of people had no places to go but were waiting in line. The management just kept we all in the rain for full one hour. They could have opened the room and let us wait inside. Previous show is done 2 hours ago n we know the performers were in another show so the room was empty. 5. Limited rides: there r really not many rides. Only 3 4 rides in each  land . Fire works last for 10 seconds. U can finish all rides in one day incl 30 60 mins waiting for each ride.Go only if your kids like Disney but u dodon't want to spend too much time. Be prepared to be pushed n cut in line by Chinese. Shows may stops at anytime too due to too many Chinese uses flash lights...,3
"Took the MTR there which is not only cheap and convenient, but there is a whole line only catering to the disneyland, so everything on that train is disney themed! Really hypes you up for the day ahead. Bought tickets there and we were like the 3rd group in the queue so very fast. This is our first disneyland trip, so my gf wanted to eat all the disney shaped food lol, pretty expensive and not worth it (to me) but she liked it. More kiddy rides for young kids and no thrilling rollercoasters so it wasdon't my kind of themepark, but overall had fun there.",3
The rides are good but the food choices are diabolical. You cadon't take your own food in so be prepared to eat crap and you'll be fine!,3
Visited last week....very easy to get to on MTR. Good day out but found only 2 big rides....most all for the little ones. Merchandise shops dominate this Disneyland. Stayed all day to catch the night parade...which was worth staying for. A good family day out.,3
Going there on a Saturday was really quite tiring considering the volume of people going t here. My son enjoyed his visit anyway. Some areas were closed also so people jam packed to areas who are a open. Could have been better if more rides are available. ,3
"Its only great for kids, no thrill place. Quite boring for adult. Universal studio is way better (i try the one in singapore) be back? No",3
"I'm sure that this Disney is a bit smaller than the one in Florida. But the entrance costs seemed lower so I cant complain. Lots of the usual Disney things to do but the staff here diddon't seem as slick as Florida staff were. Having the MTR take you straight there was good, but definitely buy them before you go as the queues were long and it was hot. We bought ours earlier in the day at the Hong Kong (not Central) MTR station   no queue.There was a good selection of food for most people, nice to see it also included Asian food and drink too. Green Tea for Mickey?",3
"Not much impressive compared to other Disneyland. Differences are Grizzly Gulch, Mystic point, and ToyStory land. Others are same as other Disney park. Another difference was you could get a few tourists from specific country cutting the line during queing for attractions, never seen this in other Disney before, ha ha. making your day dull. Entry ticket was quite expensive considering its smaller area then other Disney Parks. Dining in the Park was really expensive to rob your wallet. Overall, once was enough here, wodon't be back again.",3
"HK Disneyland is a good option for a short getaway with small children. Though rides and games are limited, it's still a fun place to hang out with the kids",3
"As the weather in Hong Kong is hot, water seems to be the most expensive item at Disneyland. Queues were OK because we went on a rainy day, but the food was ordinary and the drinks were expensive.  Park was clean and day was fun.",3
Compared to the US Disney parks you may be disappointed with this Asian offering. Only two  big rides  and 50 minute queues in buildings with little ventilation .The majority of the park is retail outlets and food halls and the park is kept very clean . Overall although enjoyable a little underwhelming .,3
We visited Hong Kong Disneyland with the kids ages 7 & 9! The kids were very excited but felt a bit let down since a lot of rides were shut..the ones that we'r operating were ok..we felt universal studios in Singapore was far better..!The highlight for them was the parade which was nice but mostly in Chinese ! The queues to meet Mickey& Minnie were very long!! Wodon't be visiting anytime soon again!,3
"Overall the place is ok. Yet, you need to plan well before going. I suggest you to go early in its opening hours as you will not have to queue up for long for the rides. Around 3pm, you need to wait for around one hour for a 5min ride.Also, if you are a Muslim, know that there is no good dining option and there is no prayer room. It will be difficult to have a place for prayer.",3
"It has some (by no means all) of the features of Disneyland but it's small and pokey really and disappointing if you've been to any of the US parks, Euro Disney or even Tokyo. To be honest I think this was just Disney marking time until the Shanghai park opened and I woulddon't be surprised to see it close once the bigger version on the mainland takes the tourists. It's not really Disney at its best. ",3
"If youre the type who'd lean onto the more thrilling side, you may skip this on your list. The place is too big but there arent many rides to choose from. Id rather enjoy and go to the oceanpark instead. This is also a bit more expensive than the latter. However, the kids will have a lot of fun. My favorite ride was the star wars underground ride, too cool to miss.",3
"It was small! Coming from the State, there was no comparison to the Disney World. But at least I could say  I've been there !",3
"It is a dissapointment this time in HK..minus the ignorance of the mainland China people. I went there before in 2012, service was great when it was still newly opened. Now, attractions would close without notice and it is the most favorite attraction that were closed. It is not recommended to come in July since it's soo HOTTTT. Food and drink are costly. If you buy the souvenir cup, cost HK88, it cost more for the drinks filled up into the cup. Totally not recommended. Disney characters hard to find. Disney MTR was great. No selfie stick sign allowed when you enter the Front Gate but people still use it inside. Go Figure!!",3
"July 6   Group of 19 spent a day in Disneyland. What a day, so hot although it rain in between. Everywhere a lot of people, too crowded. You gotta wait for at least 30 minutes for every ride. Wasted a lot of time just waiting.Really enjoyed the fireworks though.",3
"I've never been to other Disneylands... but according to everybody.. HK Disney is the smallest among all. Well, you can see everything in one day, but I truely enjoyed my time there. I loved riding Space mountain and watching old Mickey movie...",3
"Not as great at the American Disney's, but this was expected. Quite affordable in comparison though. The staff were amazing and very helpful, but I would recommend visiting any other time than in the Summer. It was too hard to line up with a 3 and 7 year old in the heat (which was 32 degrees celcius, but felt like 42c according to the app). The sprinkler system's which are at every amusement park in America, should definitely be introduced here, as we ended up missing out on a lot of rides, as the wait was too long.The parade was great   but really that was the only thing that made it feel really 'Disney'.",3
"Not ideal for thrill seekers as there are only 3 4 extreme rides. Probably best suited for families with kids although it is not a cheap day out! Plenty to do, food & souvenirs are bad value for money.",3
HK Disney is very small and lines for the big attractions are long. We did enjoy our day and took in a few attractions and the Lion King Show. We really enjoyed the Philharmagic 3 D movie!,3
"Disneyland Hong Kong is crowded all year long (which is to be expected). Had all the trappings of a typical Disneyland but warning not to wear open  toed shoes because in the mad rush (why rush?!) to enter the theatre for the lion king show, my foot got trampled on by the disgusting mob from a certain country across the border and my little toenail was ripped out (horrifying but true). Terrible start to my hk trip), love the park, hated the crowd. ",3
I'm not a Disney fan but I am a good boyfriend so it was with reservation I visited Hong Kong Disneyland. So for those in a similar predicament to me I can tell you it's not all bad. It's easy to reach via the MTR and compared to other theme parks the lines and entry isdon't too bad. We managed to fit in about 5 or 6 rides in about 5 hours of a visit. The more popular rides expect a wait of up to 50 minutes or more. You can buy an express pass though and that allows you faster access to rides. The Disney classic rides were very popular but we found the old western area pretty quiet and the rollercoaster there up with the better rides in the park. All in all though one for kids and if you are not a mad Disney fan avoid or wait until you get to Anaheim.,3
"Very average. Way to busy, people are pushy, it's over crowded and just really unenjoyable. I strongly suggest you give this a miss and go to ocean park instead.",3
"If you've been to the Disneyland in Orlando, do not expect anything close to that at the one in Hong Kong. Rides are just about ok. Not worth the money.",3
"Its a nice place to spend the day and lovely for kids. The rides and shows are good but not extraordinary, the overall resort is smaller than the other Disneylands in the world. The best attractions are the parades at 3 PM, 8 PM and the fireworks at the end. :)",3
A tiny park in comparison. And everyone breaks the rules!No selfie sticks? use your selfie stick.No queue jumping? Push to where you want?Be courtious of other guests? Beware unruly umbrellas!No spitting in the park? Dodon't even go there....A half day park at best. Poor merchandise selection. Poor dining.,3
The rides were okay but almost all the staff we met were unfriendly and sometimes unhelpful. Be prepared to pay a lot for food and drinks which could be a surprise for big families.,3
"The best days to go is weekdays. Not that many people so you wodon't stay in line for a ride too long. If you are traveling with young kids, bring a stroller and umbrella. It is open space, little shade and gets very hot. Also grab water and food for your little ones, there is only KFC around and some Chinese restaurants with overpriced food. At least you can have KFC, but kids can eat something better. (At the entrance gate mention that the food is for kids). If you are interested in a show (you can find out the time from the brochure) better be at the spot 30 min before it starts. People will gather at the main road where the show passes and if you are late , wodon't see anything. Also better to pass through all the picture stations first and take pictures with all Disney characters before lunch as they all leave for a show and have a long break after. Then when you done that you can go explore the rides. Overall it's a nice place.",3
"For females, if you plan to go on rides, wear shorts or trousers. The lock in mechanisms on some rides go between the legs and skirts would be embarrassing. Overall, Disneyland was well organised and everyone very polite when queuing. But you do have to be prepared to queue and it was very hot when we were there in July. Take an umbrella to use as a sunshade and for sudden showers.",3
This place is great to see but dont do it when it is school holidays and school break. The lines are too long and wait times are ridiculous! The fast track ticket is no use unless u get there as soon as the gate opens and book every ride!They need to have times when they will b having character interactions intead of just springing up as people miss these opportunities.,3
"We bought the tickets from a local travel agency as it's slightly cheaper than buying the tickets on the spot or online. My husband did some homework before visiting HK Disneyland by charting down which rides or shows which we would like to see and experience. Hence, we diddon't missed anyone of them. We would recommend you not to miss the Mystic Manor, Mickey and the Wondrous Book, Mickey's PhilharMagic and Hyperspace Mountain. Be careful when entering the park at 1030am as we experienced some hysterical kids running in to the park and a kid almost made my husband's camera fell to the ground. Another foreign visitor told me that the kids accidentally scratched her arms when they were running frantically into the park once it's opened.The firework display at 9pm was spectacular! Not to be missed. But do prepare that it's gonna be a big crowd going back together at the same time after the firework display.",3
"It's Disneyland right so it should be fun! Well it's not that they dodon't know what their doing its just not quite happening here but things will change soon. For the high price of admission, the park isdon't up to standards meaning it's small compared to the others. Combined with overcrowding, long lines for the kids rides and lack of shade in the sweltering heat here equals no fun and probably the main reason they are losing money. Charging the same entrance fee as other Disneylands double the size with twice as much to do also makes no sense. Looks like lots of construction is going on so hopefully in a few years I'll be back to see what has improved.",3
"if you're heavily into shopping for Disney merchandise, then this is the place for you, otherwise it really isdon't a big deal. always imagined Disney land to be really magical, but apart from a couple of rides, it wasdon't at all special. lots of long queues in the horrible heat and humidity to do anything, including say hello to the characters. they dodon't walk around the crowds, they just stand somewhere while people queue up to have photos with them. the fireworks were really so low that they could only be seen from one place in the whole park which felt like they encouraged over crowding. even the parades generate stampeding crowds. woulddon't go there again, definitely not worth the money",3
"Hong Kong Disney Land if you have never been to another is fantastic! If you have been in America you will most likely be very disappointed as it is small and hot.For kids upto 15 it can be fun as they relive the adventures of Mickey and Minne, ride and sing It's a Small World Afterall and enjoy hanging out together. I seriously advise checking the weather forecast for the evening as we waited in the best spot  in front of the castle and circular garden  for the night parade for 2 hours only to be told it was cancelled, then they did not move the time of the fireworks earlier, so rather than wait for a total of 5 hours we left at 2000. So check with staff that it going ahead or be prepared to miss it. I really recommend visiting the animation studio where they teach you to draw Disney Characters really easily in air conditioned comfort. Please note the train does not do a full circle tour, even though it announces that it does you have to get off and then line up again at halfway, disappointing when you just want to rest and have a breeze!!",3
"For those who have been to LA or Florida, one day here will be enough. It is a real Disney   clean, friendly staff, regular favourite rides   but be ready to experience the stifling humidity. Try and ensure you have the option of the swim available at then end of the day; also be warned that inclement weather caused the cancellation of the night parade both nights we were there",3
"Visited the park with my family and found that it was not value for money, staff friendliness was very poor, communication in English was a challenge, not enough English maps, choice of food and beverage was poor and not all accepted credit cards and it was quite small compared to any other Disneyland Park anywhere in the world. Good attractions included Big Grizzly Runaway Mine cars, Jungle River Cruise, Many Adventures of Winnie The Pooh, Mickeys PhilharMagic and Hyperspace Mountain. There was a mid afternoon parade which was poorly advertised. Lots of shops. I would not go to this attraction if you have visited the ones in Orlando and Los Angeles. Rather visit other attractions in Hong Kong.",3
Went with my mum and aunties and overall experience was good. Really enjoyed the 4D Disney movie and the show performances there so much with dancing and singing. Make sure you check on the timetable of each of the show so that you woulddon't miss it. ,3
"My friends and I (nine of us in total) decided to visit Disneyland during our Easter break. We booked tickets beforehand, from a website that sold it cheaper, plus the meal voucher that included one meal from any restaurant in the theme park. Originally, we had been informed by a misleading website that the $100 meal voucher included both lunch and dinner, plus a snack from the vending carts (which was an extremely good deal, which was why we got the voucher in the first place). But when we got there, we were told that the $100 voucher only included one meal of your choice which was very disappointing and overly priced. I ate a bowl of Japanese styled noodles and had a drink, which were both fortunately quite delicious.As teens, we did not spend time taking photos with Mickey or any of the Disney characters. Instead, we immediately jumped into playing some of the games, including Space Mountain (my personal favorite, although it made me a little dizzy); a game called Grizzly something, I forgot (it was a very creative roller coaster, it even went backwards!); a target hitting game (we sat in moving carts and aimed at targets with a plastic gun); and a ghost house (we sat in moving carts and was guided through a haunted house with scary objects popping out at us). We loved Space Mountain and the Grizzly game, which we played more than five times each. There were many many other games that are more suitable for younger children, but since we only enjoyed more exciting   stimulating games, we didnt bother with the other games that were intended for younger children.As we had got to Disneyland quite early (right after it opened), there wasdon't that much people at first and we were able to get to most of the games we wanted to play without having to line up. However, after lunch time, the lines grew increasingly longer and we started having to wait more than half a hour for each game. We left after one last ride of Space Mountain, at around 7 or 8. We had heard that the fireworks were worth watching, but since one of my friends was expected to return home at a certain time, we didnt stay to watch the fireworks.Luckily the weather was quite nice the entire day and we enjoyed all of the games we played. If you enjoy more exciting rides (roller coasters etc.), I would suggest you go to Ocean Park instead of Disneyland. Ocean park has much more rides that are more fun to go on (if you're older than 12 and not afraid of heights). From what I experienced, I would say that Disneyland is intended for younger children. anyone from under 11 years old would experience the most fun here.Have fun :)",3
"If you've ever visited Hong Kong Disneyland, I think you would agree with me that it's the smallest Disney park in the world.Most of the attractions are for small children or teenagers. Not so many rides for adults.The souvenir prices are slightly exaggerated and more expensive than other Disney parks.Tips: Dodon't visit the park during monsoon season and public holidays in China and Hong Kong. I would assure you that you will waste your time there for queueing.",3
"If you have been to the Disney parks in USA, expect this to be a very mini version of those. The rides are smaller as well. Unfortunately it was missing the splash mountain ride. :( Despite the size, still enjoyed ourselves. Do not miss the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars ride, by far the best ride in the park.Disney is still the happiest place regardless of the size. :)",3
We went to Hong Kong in May during school vacations and Disneyland was an obvious choice for us to include in our itinerary. It was nice and pleasant and kids enjoyed it obviously. Though having seen the US Disneyland I realized that this was an abridged version. Not everything is here which in some ways is ok as it's possible to actually cover the whole park in a day. Food options are a bit limited for vegetarians. ,3
"We finished all the rides within 1 day. Most queue was less than 20mins, which is good. Overall experience for the rides 6 10",3
it is a smaller scale of the Disneyland compared to Tokyo but a good way to start with if you are with young children. The park tickets are quite pricey.,3
"We had such a great time bouncing with rigger, visiting tarzans tree house and doing  the river ride with gina. It was my first visit in a disneyland and I  expected less than i got.",3
"My husband and I love Disney. Every 5 years, we go to Orlando's Disney World for our Anniversary. We knew HK Disneyland coulddon't hold a candle to Orlando's but we wanted to go for a cultural comparison. While this park has my favorite ride (Mystic Manor) and favorite roller coaster (Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars) out of all of the Disney rides I   ve been on, the rest of the park was lack luster. In the defense of the park, it was raining pretty much all day. (Rain has the potential to put a damper on just about anything.) The parade was understandably cancelled due to the weather. They did end up having the fireworks show at closing. The fireworks dwarfed the castle and it was a little humorous to me that the smoke from the fireworks completely hid the castle by the end. If you are in HK and you love Disney, definitely go for the Disney cultural experience. If you are not a Disney fan, this park will not make you become one.",3
There is really nothing much to see. We thought it will take us full day to see everything here but we finished all the possible rides within 4 hours. It is a small Disney land.,3
"Visited in early Jun with family. It's too much hyped, though few things like parades and shows are good. Taking photo with Characters are really frustrating and that to in hot sun. You have to wait for hours. They should have few more characters roaming around for photo pose.2 rides in tomorrow land and the roller coaster in adventure land were closed.",3
"My favorite was the Ocean Park, but he was very disappointing and the Disneyland was much better as expected!Main Street USA, Toy Story Land and Mystic Point have nothing for couples and also no good dining options. This three places in Disneyland had us disappointed and since the price of admission was sorely high, so I only can give 3 stars.At some places at Disneyland you can eat very well. Particularly pleasing were the many drink stalls, in view of the very great heat in HK (at our visit time)The  Jungle River Cruise  in the Adventureland was the best!!",3
"This might reminds you for our good old time but trust me, major attractions are catered for kids. The rides are slow and colorful which makes your kids gonna love it so much. Our real good times only at the souvenir shops",3
"We felt that this Disney is quite overrated, as the rides are not at all thrilling, and we did not encounter a single Disney character during the entire day there. The parade and the light show were also cancelled due to impending weather. I feel that the place is best suited for family with small children, maybe 7 years or less, as the elder kids will look for better rides in which case the Ocean Park is a better option.",3
"I visited Disneyland solo & while it doesdon't compare to Anaheim, I still really enjoyed myself, even the rain diddon't dampen my spirits! There were a few rides, and the longest I stood in line was 15 minutes. Dodon't miss Mystic Manor or the Jungle River Cruise. Festival of the Lion King is also one not to miss! You could should probably skip Tarzan's Treehouse as the best thing about it was the 30 second raft ride over there. Sadly, the main parade was cancelled due to the weather, but the Electric Light Parade (goes by a different name in HK) made up for it! It was spectacular! The only down point was being served a Mickey Waffle (which in itself was amazing) by an extremely rude staff member, who really diddon't embody the 'Disney Spirit' at all! Other than that, an awesome day out in Hong Kong! ",3
We have been to Disneyland in Anaheim and it is much bigger than this one. That said the parade that they have in the afternoon was spectacular and there has been no expense spared. The best rides are Space Mountain and the RC racer in Toy Story Land.I expected the food to be expensive but $105HK ( which is $21AUD) for 3 Mickey Mouse ice creams is ridiculous. The gifts in the gift stores diddon't seem too overly priced. We got the 2 day pass and we went back on the second day in the afternoon thinking it may be quieter   it wasdon't. The longest we waited was 30 minutes in a line but most of the wait time was 5 to 10 minutes. My daughter is 11 and she really enjoyed the day and that is what we all go to Disneyland for. ,3
As if you love Disney Movie definitely Disneyland will be one of your top destination. Hong Kong Disneyland is quite small but well enough to feel the magical world. Most of the rides are very gentle means only good for kids and people who dodon't like thrill rides.A great place to take photos since they have few themes on every area as Disneyland always do but too bad their castle not 100% real because some part only a picture so it wasdon't really amusing at all for me. And for better deal you can actually check KLOOK apps to get cheaper ticket for Disneyland.,3
"It an average place to visit. Not many rides for teenagers. I think not to the standards of US. It disappoints after walking for KMS. Few countable good ones like Grizly Gulch, Space Mountain, Mystic Manor. Thats it. Very costly.",3
"I had very high expectations based on visiting Disneyland in California when I was about 8yrs old. I must say, I certainly viewed Disneyland differently as a child. Dodon't get me wrong, we had a fun day. We went on a couple of rides (fairly mild imo).The souvenirs were expensive, but that is kind of expected at this type of attraction. If you have kids, for sure take them there. If your a Disney fan, you really cadon't miss it. If you have the afternoon and a couple thousand kh$ to kill, than by all means check it out. ",3
With what I would class as only 2 major rides not a great deal to keep older children occupied. Everything you expect from Disney  including characters and parades (unless it's raining) Overall a bit of a let down especially for those with US Disney experience.,3
"Went to this place last year. The place quite nice, the girls will love this place but not for my son. He was not really enjoy this place because he said this place is for girl mommy . Many cute stuffs here so i think i am the one who enjoy this place    . But when you are in hongkong i suggest to visit the place. Easy transportation stop at sunny bay station change to disneyland train.",3
"Plan your visit time carefully as this park can get really crowded. We tried to visit on other occasions but the line at the entrance was too daunting. We ended up going on a slightly rainy Saturday, and the lines were not bad at all. If you have never been to Disneyland world before you will have a wonderful time. It is a magical place. I was a little disappointed, though, because it was lacking some of iconic rides from Disney World in Orlando and Disneyland in Anaheim such as the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean. It is small in comparison to the other Disney parks including Tokyo Disney but still has the basics you would expect such as the castle, the parades, Space Mountain, etc.",3
"As a devout follower of all things Disney, I was disappointed in poor line management, which is not indicative of all other Disney properties.   This was my second visit to the HK Disneyland Park and it was a significant improvement from my 2009 trip.",3
"I have been a consistent patron of Disney for years. I never miss a trip to Disney for all my travels. Their rides are still enjoyable no matter how many times you ride ... making it timeless. New attractions and shows are being introduced. My rant is that there are an increasing number of queue cutters or line breakers. Be careful not to let your child ride by themselves, they will never be able to. ",3
"It was a great sunny afternoon to visit this wonderful attraction. Being a Monday, it was less crowded and waiting time for the rides was bearable. Unfortunately, the attractions at Tomorrowland were under improvements. Without those thrills and action, it was quite a disappointment. Felt a bit short change.",3
Compared to the Disneylands in the USA it's a bit small but none the less a lot of fun activities available for the whole family.There is a mtr station at the door step making it easily accessible.Downside when I visited were the queues.very long lines for any activity and found it very crowded also....might have been due to the school holidays.,3
"It's a good place to visit when you go to HK. I just went there for looked around, bought some souvenirs and see parade show of course. Unfortunately, it was rain on that day.",3
"Been to both Anaheim and Orlando, while the design is similar it just doesdon't have the atmosphere or Magic of these parks. Barely any rides either. Maybe with small children I would visit again, but not by myself or with friends.",3
"It was all good, just too crowded with mainland china tourists who can be very rowdy and noisy at times. It was very hard to take photographs without blockage.",3
"Nice & clean park. Some good rides but could do with updating & some more 'high thrill' rides. Think I was spoilt having done Florida first. Worth a visit. Traveled via the MTR, fast & easy, totally stress free & not heaving for the return at park close as expected. ",3
"I arrived in time for the afternoon parade, there were no queue lines so getting there was breezy. Seeing those disney characters alive was such a joy. After the parade, i was able to take a photo with goofy and pluto, but failed to see Mickey and minnie for it was already 6 in the evening and the queuing lines were closed, such a disappointment. i roamed around only to see that most of the attractions were already closed by 7pm. So i went back to the center only to find out that the evening parade had already started. There were too many people lined along the streets so it was hard to see the remaining of the parade. Lastly, i went in front of the castle, people were already seated and luckily i was able to find my own spot. I waited for at least 30minutes for the fireworks display and it was amazing, just wow! ",3
"HK Disney was built on reclaimed land (formerly Penny's Bay). When the park initially opened, the theme lands were to the bare minimum. Layout is typical Disney. The architectural design is typical and nice planting design. There are 2 hotels (economical and luxury). Plenty of parking for private cars and buses. It's connected to various parts of Hong Kong and the New Territories by a clean and efficient rail system called the MTR. Every evening they have a nice fireworks display. The Disney experience is the same worldwide. Only the park facilities differ. HK Disney has the basic theme lands. ",3
"I know this park very well because I have been a season pass holder for two years. Of all the Disneylands I have been to this is probably the smallest of all, not quite designed for the western taste, there are very few rides, most of the attractions are just 'photo opportunities' that chinese people love and westernes and not so bothered about. On a quiet day you can ride all the rides at least once some even twice. The park is clean and the staff pleasant. All the queue areas are sheltered to protect people from the sun and rain. Some of the queue areas have ventilators that are much appreciated in thoses hot Hong Kong summer days. The restaurants terrible like all restaurants at all Disneyland resorts I've ever visited. And not cheap. You are much better off bringing your own food. The only thing worth eating are the mickey mouse waffles that they sell on the cafe at the main street, but if you buy one of those, I dodon't recommend that you sit on the tables at the back of the place to eat it, because it's full of very aggressive birds that steal the food and attack the children. I usually buy the waffle and eat it on one of the benches on the main street. The shops are quite cheap and the quality of the toys is very good, the t shirts are a bit so so. The only problem with the shop is that the clothes are tailored to the chinese taste so if you are a Westener you may struggle to find things that would want to wear and fit because of lack of large sizes.",3
"I've been to this place in 2006 with nephews and nieces, this year with relatives again including 2 kids, 6 and 8. The kids enjoyed, as kids are wont to if there are rides, but there is nothing really new here except that the parade has changed. Except for one, in my opinion, all other food establishments are so so and expensive.",3
"took the kids to the famopurs hongkong disney land, the park was very small in comparison to the US cousins, some rides where very average and the waiting times where more than an hr , i'd give it a miss if i where back in hong kong.",3
"We just came back from Tokyo disneyland and since our kid still wanted to go to Disney, we went there again. The park was much smaller than Tokyo's one. The worst experience was that we faced some guests that did not want to queue in several occasions. The only advantages that Hongkong disney had were lion king show and madagascar which were not available at Tokyo's one.",3
Very small park and not many places were open since they were creating new rides. Only a few rides were ok like the Mystic Manor and Captain Buzzyear but the train and Jungle Cruise were lacking.,3
"The park itself not really big the staff it self not really friendly. I was excited to visit HK Disneyland since i like theme park, and that time was my first time for Disneyland. Unfortunately i was disappointed about this place. I diddon't know about other Disneyland but compare to other Theme park i went, i am sorry that i'm not impress. If you guys interest taking photo with Disney characters better to go early and straight away queuing, otherwise there would be long line due to lack of Disney characters. ",3
"I spent 5 hours here and was left feeling a little dissapointed. This was my first time at any Disneyland and I had high hopes of 'magic' and thrills, but only really found these at the live shows which are exceptional and definitely not to be missed. Watching the 'Festival of the Lion King' bought a tear to my eye and 'Mickey and the Wondrous Book' was also excellent, although slightly marred by the technical glitch during the performance. These very talented performers made the entrance price seem reasonable. I also appreciated the Valet service for left luggage, and parcel delivery at the gate to save carrying parcels around with you On the down side the supposed 'world famous' Jungle River Cruise was certainly not worth queuing up for 20 minutes for, and somewhat underwhelming despite our excellent guide Eric's enthusiasm. The 'It's a Small World' ride was awful in my opinion, probably only suitable for very small children. Tarzan tree house is not worth it either sadly. Next time I will bring my children, and stay for the night parade and fireworks display where I'm sure is sprinkled with magic. Also I will purchase from the Disney store at the airport rather than queuing to buy here.",3
"My wife and I visited HK Disneyland during a layover between flights. We were hoping it would be just like the one in LA. While it was nicely landscaped and pleasant to walk around, we felt that it was very much geared to families with small children     not teenagers or big kids (like us). It had no Indiana Jones Adventure, no Haunted Mansion, no Pirates of the Caribbean, no Star Tours. They were building an Ironman ride though. It seemed to us, that all the types of rides we were hoping for had been replaced with expensive food outlets and gift shops. So the admission cost was not really value for money in our opinion. Fortunately, the park was not that busy, and we diddon't have to fight the queues. We did the whole park in about 3 hours, but left feeling disappointed.",3
"It was a sunny day when I arrived at Disneyland HK. Nowhere to shelter from the Sun. The queue for games was long despite it was just an ordinary Tuesday.  The gift shop was nice. some of the items was overprice, but hey it's Disneyland.",3
"My daughter loves all things Minnie Mouse and she had a wonderful day! However there are a few things which really irritate mea) not being allowed to bring your own food or water under the pretence of security b) the food served in the restaurants   outrageously overpriced and horrible to eat   i had a pizza that cost $120, yet it tasted like cardboard. Disney should be ashamed of themselves for serving slop like this.",3
"We saw the local weather forecast n it says showers high probability of showers around noon n clear skies after 2pm. So when it diddon't rain at noon, we decided to brave it n bought the family (2 adults n 1child below 12yrs) tickets online (you will save ard HKD350).Arrived at Disney with sunny weather n clear skies! Start of our fantastic journey!We went over to the fire brigade station to rent a stroller n was advised by the staff to ride the train before renting strollers as it only travels one way.. So we did.. Mistake.. Waited 10mins for train n took it but most of the time, the view was obstructed by the trees n we all had to stop at fantasy land.. It doesdon't allow us to go all the way back to the main entrance... Really doesdon't make any sense. So since we are already at fantasy land, we decided to take the rides there. Dumbo the elephant, the carousell (waited ard 20mins each which was not too bad). After which we went over to Winnie the Pooh ride to get ourselves fast pass (there are only 2rides in Disney which allows fast pass). It was 3pm n the timing on the fast pass was 5.20pm??? We decided to break for a snack at the restaurant. Food was the usual fare... Things u usually wld never eat if you have a choice.. We went to it's a small small world n there was no q!! It was quite an amazing ride inside. After that, walked back to main entrance to rent the stroller n then went on to explore Tomorrowland. By which time, the sky was all dark n it threaten to pour.. We took our chances n continued to q.. When it was our turn n we got into the cars... It started to rain!!! We continued with the drive but what made it unpleasant was the people in front of us decided to take shelter under the bridge n all of us behind were left stranded n drenched to the core.....!!!!! The rain never stopped n everything from parade to fireworks were cancelled n it was only 5pm... Not a pleasant experience though it's not the fault of the park... We may return.. ",3
The queue was super long at all attractions. But it was relatively good experience for me and my child,3
"Tourists who have been to Disney theme parks in other cities may be disappointed with this one.  Best to visit outside of weekends and public holidays, and when the weather is pleasant.",3
nice place there are lots of place where u can shoot pictures.We recommended you that to check the weather before u go there 3 4 hrs ahead if it rains there aredon't any more activities to enjoy,3
"Children under 6 , are the only ones who would like this. There was nothing exciting for anyone aged 6 years and one day. Total waste of time and money. If you simply want to tick the Disney box then well go.... Otherwise forget it",3
"If you have been to Anaheim Disneyland then dodon't waste your time here :( Sorry sounds harsh but it is harsh no real rides or atmosphere its just plain old dull i got more enjoyment out of discovering Hong Kongs underground rail system On a brighter note it is extremely organised, clean, and queues were short did not see any express ticket lines maybe they didnt need them for the teacup merry go round We took our own lunch but there was plenty of places to buy lunch Great for the kids , personally myself give me the real thing you cannot substitute the real Disneyland ",3
"Easier to get in rides and photo with characters because queues are much shorter compare to the one in Japan. However, Disney staff at some eateries and cafes wasdon't so friendly and look grumpy.. Overall still nice to visit hk Disney with kids because it's time saving and still consider a pleasant visit.. Had great fun too but do keep your eyes on your kids at all times. Oh ya, they give stickers to kiddies.. Definitely kids are happy with it.. ",3
"Small, crowded, catered for little ones.  The only thing better than any other Disneyland is that you can actually get relatively good food.  That is about it.",3
"Hong Kong Disneyland is just one time visit, it's not really big like other Theme Parks, not so impressive for adults.",3
"As usual, Disneyland never fails to disappoint too much, even if it is a small scaled one like in HK. However, the crowd on the weekends are massive and it would be good to go on the weekdays instead. We went both days on Sunday and Monday and the queues to the rides were way shorter on Monday.The shows are worth queuing for and a must watch with the kids.",3
If you have not been to Disneyland USA this is good but if you have it is disappointing. It is a lot smaller and does not have the offerings you would normally get. Kids will love it though so worth the visit. The MTR makes is easy to get to as it is out by the airport and a bit of a trip.,3
"Hong Kong Disneyland is certainly a fun visit if you have the time, but if you've been to the US parks   dodon't expect too much. Imagine Disneyland in California. Remove the 'California Adventure' part. Then takes what's left and sort of 'reduce it down' and you have Hong Kong Disneyland. Not terrible, but also rather small and   again   sort of reduced and minimized. They also have a strange opening procedure...I got there early and actually waited in line for the front gate to open, which was fine. However once in they only allow you on Main Street USA at first, keeping you from entering the actual park for about 30 minutes. After THAT, they do a sort of 'rolling opening' of the lands (and dodon't tell you which open first) so not EVERYTHING is available to do right when you get there. I went to the left to head to Mystic Manor (a GREAT ride, BTW!), only to be stopped and told that area was not opening for another 30 minutes. So I had to completely backtrack to Tomorrowland since that was open. It's just a strange system!",3
"Check the weather first before visiting, April is Rainy season in HongKong. A big No! We went to Disneyland last April 25, they cancelled the night parade minutes before the performance because of sprinkled rain. A lot were disappointed, we do understand but yeah! Toooooooooo baaaaaaad! ",3
Not as many attractions as in the USA.  Overpriced . Many rides were out of service for maintenance.   The good thing was not a crowd at the rides. It was still a good experience.,3
"I've been to the HK Disneyland twice and the first time we made the mistake of going during December January which was a terrible idea! We waited more than an hour for each ride and it was so crowded, I swore never to return. I went again last year but during an off peak season, April and we stayed at the Disney Resort. Disneyland will ALWAYS have lots of people but luckily it wasdon't so crowded and the longest we waited for a ride was probably 10 15min which really isdon't so bad. I was disappointed however that customers who stayed at the resort diddon't get exclusive access or anything at the theme park. The Theme Park itself is very small so 1 day is definitely enough to go on all the rides. ",3
"You should only visit Disneyland Hong Kong of you are accompanying children. Nothing major for adults to explore at the park and as far as the rides are concerned, each and every ride at ocean park is much better than Disneyland. Food options at the park are rather overpriced and so are the souvenir shops. So in a nutshell only worth it for kids and Disney aficionados.",3
"If this was your first Disneyland experience, this was ok but not great. For those who are use to American style amusement parks, this would be a bust. You can walk the whole park in about an hour or two and the limited rides were not that exciting as it is here in Calif or Florida.",3
"This park has limited appeal for those children 12 and upwards, and even less so when a whole section is closed and therefore some of the more adventurous rides not available. It would be good to have notices advising potential customers of the closure of rides as this does effect a person's level of enjoyment at the park. When we visited many, many food   refreshment outlets were also closed which meant limited choice for food and beverage. ",3
"There were just so many people. The first part of the day was fine. Parade was nice. There are some interactive parts of the parade when the performers will invite little kids to play. The queues were bearable except some which you may have to wait 45 minsThe tram that goes around disney is usually two way. So we parked the stroller at Fantasy land. Only when we were queuing then they made the announcement that all passengers have to alight at the main station which means we have to walk all the way back to get our stroller. Prepare you video cameras cos right after fantasy land, into tomorrowland, There will be little monsters greeting the passengers. Hahahaha!!!Food and drinks are expensive but it should not be a surprise. Themed parks are all like that. But the food options are really quite limited. dragged her daughter and right past everyone to stand in front for Elsa photo taking. Even after they told her nicely, she became fierce. Most are ok but you have to stand firm and tell them to please not jump q. Some will just ignore you. HahahaThe crowd. The crowd! Where do I start? Where do these people come from. All of a sudden, just before the night parade, throngs of people started appearing from everywhere. It was so crowded, it was impossible to walk. Right after the parade, everyone rushed to the shops. It was IMPOSSIBLE to walk. The people jumped over our stroller, stepped on our feet, without any apologies, like that was the way to go. The park guests were so rude and horrid. They cough into your face and do not queue. Earlier in the day, one Mainland chinese mother,blatantly ignored everyone in the q, she walked past everyone and stood right in front of the queue. When told that she has to q, she became fierce and ignored the comments. How scary...If you are staying at the Disney Hotels, there are frequent bus shuttle services that will bring you to Disneyland but its still a good ten min walk away. If you are travelling with kids, better bring whatever they need. For those who do not wish to pay the entrance fees and still would like to catch the fireworks, feel free to wait at the entrance. There is a nice fountain where you can take pics while waiting for the fireworks to start.Go there knowing that you will have to brave the crowd, you will have fun and survive. Overall, its still a fun place to go",3
"Like many theme Parks, there are various worlds. U probably need 2 full days to try all the rides or catch all the shows and parades. End of day fireworks. Food and beverages available all over the park. Assessable n friendly to the handicapped. Very friendly staff. A kid's magical place. ",3
"It was my first time to go to Disney theme park. We stayed at Kingdom club in Disney hotel so had special entry gate to right end of gate options which made entry quick & easy. When we booked our Disney tickets we were unsure if we were wasting a day of our time in Hong Kong. But we had a fabulous day which was without a doubt our best Disney park experience. We initially though that normal theme park might queue for rides long time, cost, quality of food and overall experience. However, Hong Kong Disneyland is the opposite it wasdon't too busy, granted it was a weekday and not peak season. There were no hour long lines for rides most were 5 15 mins so you can do all the rides in one day. It is a well structured park and it was nice to be able to get character photos with just a couple of minutes wait not long lines. Besides, Street parade is great, best spot is between the Disney castle and street as the parade stopped there for quite a while for static entertainment which only a limited number of people saw.The food selection was good, well priced and there were healthy options. Overall, if you havedon't been to a Disney park yet go to this one first.",3
"compared to disneyland in tokyo or universal studios , hong kong disneyland is in need of a renovation. The decor looks unmaintained for like years, the color of the buildings look so pale and old. What's worse is the staff here look so moody and unfriendly for a place which is supposedly to be fun and exciting,Nothing much here and some shows are closed so the only mickey mouse show u need to queue over an hour if not you wodon't be allowed in. The parade was the best part as the performers are a little bit more lively. Other than that nothing exciting here. Only spent like 3 hours or less here. ",3
"This was our second visit and our children had ceased to be that excited by it. The Frozen offering remains very limited, the queues were significant. Still a fun day out but not quite the magic experience I believe Disney Land Paris is.",3
Hong Kong Disney land is so small compare to the other Disney land moreover some of visitor dodon't know how to queue and that make this place more annoying.,3
"Disneyland HK is awesome, very clean and neat. Liked the fact that some of the rides were update to modern world. Like small world u notice that the toys are new and cant notice some of the joints. Its a bet of small park so one whole day is good but avoid weekends and holidays it gets really busy. What i diddon't like about it were two things. Quality of food was ok, i remember in orlando and paris food was so good but in this park food was average, except for deserts they were very good. Maybe thats to keep cost down but would consider having 1 or 2 resturant with higher quality food (could be burger and pasta better than what they got right now). The biggest thing that upseted me was taking picture with characters. We walked in to the park and my 1 year old saw Mickey and Donald and ran to them. But the people handling the line said they are done cause they got to get ready for the parried. It was only 12 and parried is at 3 pm. They said come back after 3:30!!! Like kids can work with appointments. How can u say no to a kid. What was more upsetting we went to a store close by came out and saw some new people in the line!!! Its like choosing, was going to make an issue on the spot but my girl wanted to play so diddon't want to make her day worse. I am not sure if management will read this but they need to get their staff act together and get them educated on how to manage a kids world (not a adult world).  ",3
"Quite a bit smaller than the one in Florida, but still has a variety of rides (Space Mountain etc...)   Not cheap for 1 day, but if you live here the yearly passes are good value.",3
"It's nice but not more than that. If ur kid is a Disney buff he will have a blast, if not u might find the place a bit disappointing. It's run down, much smaller and less attractive somehow than other Disney around the world, but if u have nothing to compare it too you'll enjoy it. Food is over priced, mainly Asian (Chinese Indian) so bring along sandwiches and drinks. Also, no alcoholic beverages (for the adults)... Also, dodon't come on weekends or holidays. ",3
"It is a good place to bring the childern to spend a day. But, it is not comparable to LA , Tokyo or the Disney World. It is much smaller and I just dodon't find the motivation to queue uo for something that I have seen before. The staffs are visibly bored and I ca understand why. Better go in Winter wgen it is dry and not boiling hot. The food inside, undersatandably, is very expensive.",3
"This is nothing like the size or scale of Disney in Florida. I went with my 11 year old son in March. The weather was great. I woulddon't want to go in the summer with rain, heat and high humidity. In each of the four or 5 sectors, there is one big ticket ride. The lines as always in Disney are long and for some of the rides, we felt that a 40 minute wait was not worth it   Winnie the Pooh ride and the Autopia ride for example. If you have a toddler, I'd avoid any rides with long lines. You can get fast track tickets which are a better option but go early and plan your rides ahead for this option to work for you. Food options are very limited with a few corn cob, hot dog, pop corn and candy floss stalls and over crowded restaurants selling mediocre Chinese and western food. Take your own. We purchased a 2 day ticket but were fed up with the heat and the crowds after a day. If you are selective about your rides, there is no need to purchase a 2 day ticket. Entry lines die down at about 2 or 3 pm.",3
Our family of 4 had a spare day and decided to go to Disneyland. We took the MTR was which easy and very fast. The park itself was fun but small. There are only 2 real rollercoaster rides. All in all we had a good day and are glade we've seen ,3
"If you have been to other Disney parks give this one a miss.  So much smaller and many of the popular rides missing.  Highlights were space mountain, river cruise and mystic house.  Always a great atmosphere, no crowds here, no queues for rides.",3
"After an easy but very busy train ride, you will be greeted with a very long walk to the entrance, we took the train around the park first to get a look at where to explore, all you see is trees, the main ride was down for maintenance, mystic manor is fantastic ride, the rest are boring, it's all but impossible to get a photo with a character, food and souvenirs are very expensive, movie world in Brisbane Australia is so much better.",3
"the park was big but my kids was not enjoy much because they are waiting much time for each play , example we wait 45 minute just to play on the car , the minimum waiting for each play 30 minute which make you feel poring.",3
booked via klook. food n rides r underwhelming. not much to do for an experienced traveller. though my kids were happy to enjoy it but we left before the night parade n even wasted our dinner coupons to dine out at a better place.,3
"This is the smallest of all Disney parks worldwide. It's situated on Lantau Island, not far from the Airport and Tung Chung suburb. It looks like it is build in the middle of nowhere. The walkway leading towards the park can use a Disney Village to brighten up the area. The park itself lacks a wide variety of attractions and rides. It's adjusted to Asian prefferences which means no real thrills, mostly show and shopping. ",3
"Its really a nice place for kids..Younger kids from the age of 3   12.I suppose so. Coz as parents we enjoy just becoz our kids are enjoying. Otherwise its not anywer close to universal studio in Singapore. Myself, my husband and my eldest son 11 yrs loved univeral studio more than disneyland and to surprise disneyland is more costlier than univeral studios ! Anyways its a best place for young kids...and should never miss the ending fireworks.",3
We went twice to Disneyland Hong Kong. The first was In sept. It was humid hot long queues and a nightmare with a little kid in tow. But we still had fun. Perhaps it was the magic of seeing the Disney characters come to life. The second time around the weather was so pleasant we didnt mind the waits. In fact they seemed shorter. It was less crowded perhaps because it was March and a little chilly. The shows were fantastic. The only disappointment was that we diddon't see any characters for the meet and greet except for Mickey and Minnie. There was nothing from frozen which was the main reason my daughter wanted to go apart from a brief appearance in the show. Judging from the popularity of frozen u would expect a whole lot more. Overall an enjoyable experience but then again I havedon't been to any other Disneyland to compare. ,3
This doesdon't come close to the one in Orlando.... The rides are far too few and the place is more of an extended shopping mall than an amusement park. Diddon't live up my expectations. Plus the park ticket for a day is 549 HKD which isdon't worth spending as it takes less than half a day to see the entire park...you can give it a miss. ,3
"During the weekends and public holidays, there are generally long queues for everything which means that you cannot do everything in one day or that day would have to be a very long one. The rides cater more to the under 10 as there are few thrilling rides for the tweens and teens. The shows are quite professionally done and are crowd pleasers. There's a lot of shopping of DISNEY items and the food outlets are average and expensive.",3
disneyland hongkong is ok but the other disneys..in florida or california..even in paris are better.it needs a bit of renovation.but it is great for children and very easy to get to.,3
"This is a Disney of sorts but if you are looking for all the hype that surrounds Disneyland this is not for you. The rides are meant for small people so, while it is good for the locals, it is not great for tourists who may not be economical is size. We took the kids once because they wanted to compare it to Disneyland California. Not much to compare. ",3
We visited at chines New Year so busy timeIt was an ok attraction some of the rides were great fun especially the old west rideNot for small childrenFood etc very expensive and you need to wear good walking shoes as large areas to walk around,3
"If your a Disney Dork you will appreciate park and its twist on Disney. The park is very small, you could easily do the whole park in half a day so I woulddon't be comparing the park to California or Orlando... or even Paris. If you know your Disney Parks you know they love lining queuing you up for rides and shows. At this park while waiting to see Festival of The Lion King show there was nothing like this to keep people in line no staff and ropes as soon as the doors opened to theatre everyone was pushing and shoving (which is not in the Disney spirit).Festival of The Lion King was absolutely amazing and personally think its better then the one in Animal Kingdom in Orlando.The one thing that bugged about this park is there wasdon't Walt Disney statue.Would definitely recommend it to people! ",3
"Disneyland Hong Kong was the only Disney park I've been to so far. For the most part, it was a great experience and it is a lot of fun, although one has high expectations for Disney Land and I feel this one has some shortcomings. The castle appears to be a giant cardboard cutout for example. Cardboard cutouts are not magical. I still recommend going.",3
One of the smallest Disney in the world! Not many attractions. Can finish in half day.. Woulddon't really return! Tokyo USA Paris are way better,3
"If you have been to Disney World in the USA or to any other Disneyland in the world, I would not recommend to visit Hong Kong Disneyland since you will basically experience the same attractions and sights.It is very well connected to the public transportation (MTR station Sunny Bay to change lines), the site is clean. But the entrance fee is rather pricey. ",3
"Hong Kong Disneyland shoulddon't really be advertised as Disneyland haha. It's super small and while it is very cute, it was just a little sad. Tomorrow land isdon't really tomorrow land, more like tomorrow corner. Space mountain isdon't as cool. No splash mountain, no Haunted Mansion :( Staff weredon't really friendly, a bit cold. Just kinda strange experience. You cadon't go into the castle, no Peter Pan ride! Haha other than that it's not really as expensive to get in, and it is very fun to go to Disneyland in another country right? So go and have fun, but be prepared. Hope this helps!! :)",3
You dodon't have to worry too much if you go there with young kids: they should be busy for all the time they are in the park.However this is not a huge Disneyland park with tons of attractions. Still it is worth a visit.During the winter season it does not seem to be packed at all so you wodon't wait too long before enjoying attractions.In short it's good fun but in my view it is not as special as the other Disneyland parks in the US or in France.,3
We had an enjoyable day there. But we're disappointed as space mountain and winnie the pooh were under maintenance. Most of the rides are for younger children so we were really looking foward to the space mountain. Oh well...we did have fun at the end of the day. Do not miss the fireworks. It was amazing. I would appreciate if the shops were to close a little later. We did not have time to shop as we were trying to cover as much as we can in the park. So the best time to shop would be after the fireworks.,3
"We found a Buy 3 get 1 Free ticket promotion online and the prices were the cheapest except that we needed to visit before January 3, 2016. We coulddon't make it any other dates except on January 1, 2016 and that day happened to be a busy day for HK Disneyland. We bought a Disneyland PhotoPass package which we thought it was a good deal since we are splitting the cost. But we later realized that we had spent too much time waiting in line to take pictures with the Disneyland characters and that we did not enjoy as many rides as we would like. The park itself is small but we did not have time to walk through the entire park. The fire work show at night was great. Make sure you start saving your spot for this fire work show. The mid day parade was good too. Recommend going early in the day and start enjoying the park.",3
"Most of their rides and activities are for kids, but they have a few rides for adults like the train station and the boat ride by the lake. If you're looking for some adventure, it best to go to Universal Studio or Ocean Park.",3
"Normally I wouldn   t think of Disney as relaxing but HK Disney definitely is. We went on a Monday at about 11AM just to beat the crowd which was highly unnecessary. It was also super easy to get to by subway. The main part of the park was just opening and there were only a few people there. It is, as expected, much smaller than Disney World but still has many of the same attractions, just less of them overall. Because there were so few people in the park the entire day we never had to wait more than 3 minutes to get on a ride and since there aren   t that many rides we were able to do everything we wanted multiple times. However, myself and my friend I went with are both full grown adults so we only did a few of the rides that appealed to us so there was a lot of free time where we just walked around and enjoyed the scenery. The best part of the day was he food we had at the River View Caf   across from the Jungle River Cruise. They offer a    high tea    set menu which was excellent. Cute and delicious dim sum that definitely fills you up too. You can get other drinks as well since it may be a little too hot out for tea. And again since it was crowded at all we were just able to sit and relax. I definitely wouldn   t go if you   re looking to go on rides unless you   re travelling with young children. And as long as it is not a busy day I wouldn   t plan for more than half a day there. ",3
"Although much smaller than its counterparts, Hong Kong Disney is still a fun day out. They do sell multi day passes but you definitely dodon't need more than a day to see it all if you plan your day well. Highlights: space mountain is better than others, and in place of the haunted mansion is Mystic Mansion with a magical rather than ghostly theme. Food is very expensive, not great, and few Western options. Staff were all very helpful and polite. ",3
It's nice place but the kids will enjoy it more. For adults you have only 2 3 attractions.   The price is little bit high. It's not Paris or USA :),3
"Ok. So Disneyland is for kids right? Well we are all big kids really... and Disneyland is still a relatively fund day out for adults. Starting with the positives, the mine train ride is awesome, Space Mountain is pretty cool, plus there is a good brunch in one of the hotels, where you can high five Pluto and hang out with Goofy. The downsides... 1) The park is pretty small 2) The castle is about the same size as a normal suburban house and 3) this is for kid's fundamentally!",3
We decided to visit with our 3 yr old daughter whilst on holiday from the uk. Having never been to any other Disneyland locations I was very disappointed with it.There was a distinct lack of Disney characters around and there seemed to be more shops than attractions. Frankly peppa pig world at Paultons Park in the Uk was more enjoyable.I woulddon't visit again.,3
"went there becos of my boy. was crowded and every rides would take about 60   70 mins of queuing. there are few rides that visitors can get express Q. however, this express tickets are not given out thru out the whole day. only for limited time in a day. ",3
"This was a disappointment. The decor was great, but there are not enough rides for the amount of people they let in, and everyone (inc adults, actually, the majority are adults) goes on every ride, including the ones obviously designed for small kids (e.g. carrousel). This resulted in long lines everywhere, 1 hour waits for most rides. The abundant warning signs suggest the rides are very exciting, which they were for our 4 & 8 year old, but not for any adult who's been to a western amusement park before. The park has been filled with shops and restaurants, more than one needs, as there were no lines for any of these. This may have had something to do with the prices and the quality of the food. On the positive side: the easy MRT access and the park maintenance and cleanliness. If you want to do a theme park in South East Asia with young kids, I think Legoland in Johor is the superior option. For bigger kids take Universal Studios in Singapore. ",3
"having been a plenty of times, a definite change of staff attitude (gosh, where's the  smile you are on stage  disappeared to) and a drop in quality is very visible. Very disappointing. Throughout most of early 2015 it's been every time fantastic. polite, friendly staff, great access to the characters and most rides open. After September 2015 there's been a clear decline on all levels; prices went up; attractions keep being closed or removed (why the hell would you stop the Frozen experience if that is still such a success and so many merchandise things are still so popular   the area it had been in, is now empty anyways?!? So you get less for more money. very disappointing. ",3
"Was a very hot day, not enough shade, the lines weredon't too long so that was a plus. We have been to LA so it was nice but hard to enjoy compared to LA. if you never been to the states do this one first as its much smaller and nice, but as my son said the LA is Bigger and better",3
"I've been to the Disneylands in Tokyo, California, France and Hong Kong. In terms of the grandness of the four, HK comes in last. In terms of queue time , shortest. In term of friendliness, bottom two. You dodon't really see the staff smiling here...to me, that is a pre requisite. It's Disneyland and staff are supposed to be warm and smiling and.... U get my drift. Lots of mainland Chinese who love to cut queue but there's nothing much u can do except to tell them off. Was also disappointed that the classic theme ' when you wish upon a star' was non existent at the entrance. That always prep my mood when I enter all Disneylands. Of all the castles, this one is the simplest and shortest as well. ",3
"Visited here with family and it was great fun! But since we visited in June, the heat was scorching and very tiring to stand in long queues for every ride. Each ride took us atleast 40 45 mins in queue and the ride was just for 10 mins, so plan your trip in off season! The rides were fun and DO NOT MISS the parade!There is a lot for older kids and adults too. Visit the roller coaster in the dark. Dont remember the name now.",3
"Most of the rides were pretty usual rides found in most parks. Adults will find the park boring, the kids will like most of the rides.",3
"My husband and I enjoyed HK Disney, but were surprised that there are only two high speed adult rides (and even those weredon't that thrilling). Unless you are with kids, dont waste time standing in queues for Tomorrowland's go carts or Its a Small World. The parade was really great (it started at 3pm) and I loved the colourful Toy Story theme!!",3
Walked all the way to Mystic Manor and discovered is not available. Park shall have some sign board around the park to provide information on the availability and also waiting time for each ride.,3
"Renowned name but almost like an average amusement park to me.If they are famous for renowned cartoon characters, also they will be criticized for non systematic arrangement of rides and showing characters for photography with the visitors. All the characters are standing on their different points at the same time. How one person can take more than one photograph with the characters at the same time? They are standing on different places which are far one from another.Well appointed park.Nice parade on two times.But entry fees are too expensive.",3
"The rides were mediocre at best and were not very thrilling, since the park caters mostly to young children. Food was grossly overpriced and the serving staff were not particularly friendly. Souvenirs were uninteresting and overpriced as well. The queues were long even though this was supposed to be the off peak season (I was there on 17 Dec). Basically I found the whole thing boring and overrated.Plus point was the parade and firework, which must have been fascinating to the kids. Decorations were very much Christmasy and the park provided many phototaking spots. I particularly liked the decorations on the Disneyland MTR. The staff were especially good at handling young children. A recommended place for family outings.Still, overpriced is the word. And I am no longer a kid, so maybe Disneyland just does not seem so magical anymore.",3
"This is the second time we've been to the Disneyland in Hong Kong. The first time was 2 years ago. Since then we've been to the Tokyo Disneyland. In comparison, the Hong Kong Disneyland is small and somewhat limited. Food option are less exciting and rides and attractions are smaller and less in quantity. Merchandise were expensive (as expected) but also limited compared to Tokyo's one. This time round, there were less people so it was at least more enjoyable.  Disney Paint the Night  was my personal favourite. Fireworks is at 9pm which is rather late but if you are on holidays you can perhaps afford to allow the children to stay up late. Dodon't try to prepare your day by using any information they provide online because the online information is just not up to date. A bit frustrating to have planned our day according to their information just to find that the plan was not going to be helpful. We recommend if you wish to stay for the fireworks to arrive just before noon so you have enough energy by the time the fireworks start. If you intend to go to Ocean Park and Disneyland, there are some discount for purchasing both park tickets if you hold a foreign passport. It worked out to be a saving of $99 HKD for adult and $59 HKD for child",3
It's for young families  it's tired meaning a small world was closed for our visit it's not friendly at all found the model of Disneyland has not kept up at all,3
"As my tile says, nothing beats Orlando, this is totally a trip worth it for families with small children and Not with teenagers",3
The entrance fee was a bit expensive. Should have purchased the cheap tickets online from the travelling agency before to avoid queuing in front of the ticket selling counter. Crowds were everywhere but the experience was indeed magical. Especially love the rides.,3
This park is quite small compared to Anaheim. Go early as we had a maximum wait of 10 mins for space mountain and walked onto most other rides until about 12.30pm. Lines still weredon't massive after this. We went Wednesday.Still has the disneyland feel but dodon't expect to spend all day there. Good for younger children or if you have a day to kill. Took a cab for convenience $180hkd one way.,3
This is the smallest of the Disney parks   I  ve been to them all. It is friendly   unlike Tokyo   but too small to give you the genuine Disneyland experience. Worth a visit if you are travelling with small kids.,3
If you have never b sen before in one of Disney Park maybe this is a one day experience to be ok but if you have visited other Disney Park you will be disappointed. It is a nice place to spend a couple of hours if you have very young kids other than that I would highly recommend not to go instead go to Ocean Park.,3
"The place is meant to enthrall the infants, they may like it, but for the older guys who have seen a bit of places, it does not inspire the ideas so much. Expectations were huge considering the publicity and the price, but at the end of the day you may feel exhausted. The night parade is a good thing not to miss. Otherwise the rides are cheap!",3
Ok experience. Very expensive.  Probably worth going elsewhere.   Have been to most other Disneyland and this seems very expensive.,3
I dodon't know if i were to say this..there a lots of prc at hk disneyland..although they contribute most of the attraction economy in hk i feel it a need to educate them how to queue up and not just to rush on everything..btw the place is good..,3
"Chances are that you will have to go the Disneyland irrespective of what I say because your little ones dodon't believe in reviews from Internet but at least this review will help you prepare better for whats in store for you.Getting There   Best way is through MTR. Take the Tung Chung Line and get down at Sunny Bay station and from there take the dedicated Disneyworld train which runs every 10 minutes or so. Get there early. Because almost for all the rides you will have to wait in queue lasting anything between 20 minutes to 90 minutes. Sad part is except for Space Mountain and Mine train rest are lame even for kids as old as 8 years. Do take the river raft in adventure land, the lion king life show and the Astrobuzz ride. Its a fun experience for kids and adults alike. Rent a stroller because the kids will get tired after some time. You can rent them just after entering on left side of the main square at the fire station at 100 HKD for the day with an additional 100 HKD refundable security deposit. Do get in front of castle by 8:15 to 8:30 PM to see the fireworks scheduled at 9 PM everyday. A good idea will be to get food as take out and then eat while waiting for the show to begin.PhotoOps with characters   A must have for the kids. The challenge is that the queues for it are very long. A recommendation will be to skip Mickey & Minnie in begining and cover them in afternoon because that's where the biggest queue is.",3
Was a great winters day in Hong Kong on xmas eve. We did not wait long for a ride and stayed until the end for the fireworks which was a bit of a letdown but other than that a great day was jad by all,3
"Very long lines for very short so so rides. Not all rides have FastPass. Never really got to use as smaller rides did not have. Food can be improved...so bad. Staff are not as enthusiastic as in the U.S. Although my 5 year old likes Ocean Park better, both our kids enjoyed HK Disneyland nonetheless. And honestly, that's all that matters. The magic is there.",3
Disneyland is targeted towards youbg families...  Im a little jaded perhaps as its basically a large shopping mall....    Transport is efficient and the shows are very good.  Nightly fireworks are good..,3
"Visited without my children as it was on our way to the Big Buddha and the cable cars at the time were closed, hence we stopped off at Disneyland instead. The parade was great and the rides for smaller kids were good, I know that if my children had been with me they would have been disappointed with the lack of larger, thrilling rides (eldest is 13) and to be honest the amount of rides in general were not very many. I did feel that there were too many shopping and buying experiences as opposed to rides and adventures   indeed compared with Universal Studios in Singapore, thee is absolutely no comparison at all! Nice to have been, but a slight disappointment given that it's Disneyland!",3
Not much changes apart from my 1st visit there 8 yrs back. Think only the merchandise are new with some new addition like the Frozen stuff which was pretty popular during my 2nd visit there. Same senario that you have to queue for each and every ride. Money worthwhile when my 2 kids enjoyed.,3
The rides are good but my 9 year old boy enjoyed only a couple. Disney could do better with food by adding lot more in local cuisine. Getting to Disney is easy and best in HK. Iron man ride coming up which should be added attraction for boys. The evening parade is electrifying!,3
"Probably smallest of the parks.  Only a half day event so if you go, Lantau is a good option for the second half of your day.  Ocean Park was better!",3
"Well maintained and definitely family friendly, its a great wonderland for children. There's a Frozen Christmas Tree light up by Ana & Elsa at 6.35pm if your kid is a fan of Frozen. The Paint the Night Parade at 7.35pm is also a colourful display of lighted carriages not to be missed! Unlike Disneyland Japan, the rides in this wonderland may not be exciting enough for adults looking for a thrill as this park is mainly built for children. We took abt a day & a half to explore the park and yet it is not enough to cover everything there. The queues are long and the rides only last a minute. Fast pass is only offered on two rides at Space Mountain & Winnie the Pooh Adventures. Our favourites are the U racer & the Mystic Manor ride. At night, the park becomes romantic with Main Street USA lit up. Do go to the park after breakfast as most of the restaurants in the park only open at 12pm except for the bakery where you can grab bread & coffee on the go unless you could find a seat at the outdoor parlour. ",3
"Went on Christmas Day.  Huge crowd.  All attractions were 45mins or more wait.  Prices on food were quite high...  Not many cast members around to help with directions, etc..  Good for family groups on non peak periods.",3
"I had 4 days to spend in HK and really wished that I haddon't wasted a whole day in Disneyland. Even thought I had my 6 year old with me, it just wasdon't big or interesting enough to have spent a whole day here. Now, I've been to Orlando a few times so my expectation was high   but if you've got nothing to compare to, then it might be ok. There were no characters to be seen. The food was also terrible   I had the worse hot dog and hamburger in my life here in Disneyland HK. ",3
"Highly overpriced and a longish train ride from the main islands I expected a bit more from Disneyland considering the exorbitant price. You are not allowed to take any food in and the price of their food and drink is just ridiculous. 30HKD for a coke???. I suggest a big breakfast and eat again only after leaving the park.But having said that they spared no expense in making this as enjoyable for kids as possible. Shows throughout the day, parades and a fireworks display to close the night off. Management of queues at rides are good and waiting times were average in most rides and very short at some. Although the park is huge, it does have a train running on the perimeter to help and the walking is not too bad. Some of the rides are quite unique. There isdon't too much for adrenalin junkies but there are some fast rides. They also seem to be continuously adding attractions as 2 things were under construction while we were there. Try and be quick and go to the shortest queues first as there is alot to try and finish in a day. An idea is to try and go to the long queue rides while the parade is on so you can save time (but miss the parade obviously)",3
"In comparison to paris disneyland, this park is much smaller and so over crowded, I think management should consider either minimizing number of entries per day, or since it is so successful maybe build an another park just like paris, we diddon't enjoy our selves as much as we did in paris. ",3
I thought Disneyland has same standard all over the world. I found bubble gum on the floor which is pretty disgusting.,3
"I have just spent the day with my family at HK Disneyland, and my overall impression of the place was average. I was staying in Hong Kong for a few days, and deliberately delayed my visit to Disneyland till the Monday to avoid the crowds. However, that diddon't seem to help much.Having visited Universal Studios Singapore a few times, I would say that Disneyland Hong Kong is not as good. Universal sells a Fastpass which allows you to skip the queues on all the rides for an additional fee, however, the Disney Fastpass is only available for 2 rides, and works somewhat differently.The average wait time per attraction was 40 60 mins, and the park seemed to be bursting at the seams. Waiting 1 hour with 2 small kids for a 3 minute ride is not fun. The park itself is not massive and can be easily completed in one day. The food at the park is very expensive and the quality is not great. Hong Kong Disneyland is one of those theme parks that you will visit once on a holiday to Hong Kong, but it's not one of those places you would return to in a hurry.",3
"Having gone to most Disneyland parks, I would say the attention to the details with the HK one is at par. It's possible to cover the small park in a day esp. if you have young kids and willing to start at rope drop, which I never felt with other Disneyland parks. The foods are central kitchen prepared and actually not bad at all.I would say the main let downs are:(1) Too few attractions with fast passes. Some queues are 90min long and that is on a weekday, which I'm certain fast passes would be in order.(2) Cast members are generally way way poorer in training and service than other Disneyland parks. Knowing Disney's attention to such details, it was disappointing. Some cast members are downright rude and physically handled people in queue, which was very surprising. Others are lackluster and their glum faces stood in contrast to the park's joyful design. I know it's a park targeted at Chinese tourists, but with Shanghai park opening in a few months, they should have upped their game.That said, our kids enjoyed themselves (it is a Disneyland afterall!). But I'm not sure if I would really want to revisit the small park, esp. when service and attitude is so poor.",3
The actual park itself is quite small compared to the Disney parks in the States. The shows were really good. The Lion King show was the highlight and a must see!,3
"We have been to countless of disneyland and for sure HK one is definetly not the best. The park isnt exactly that big, if u are not into rides, a one day pass is more than enough to cover from morning to night! Be expected to wait at least 45mins and above for those very popular rides. Some do offer fast pass, do check it out so u dont have to waste time q  ing for it. Tips  if u are travelling with young children and first time to disneyland. Wld suggest that you stay at Disneyland hotel for a night or two before moving on to city hotels. Save on travelling time and is always a nice experience staying in disney hotels. ",3
Disney in Hongkong  is small compared to others. And if you have seen one in Orlando this one will be very small. There are not many rides or shows. But again disney is disney no matter what. Soforget about reality and let your imagination fly.,3
We booked via Klook and got straight to the entry. Unfortunately the queues inside were loong. 40 min queue for a 3 minute ride. Get the express pass if you really want to enjoy the experience especially with young ones. My 4 year old could only recognize Woody & gang and Miles from Tomorrowland as he's seen it on TV. Of course Mickey & gang too. He diddon't really get what's the hype all about (what disney princess? what dumbo? :)) . Parade was great and all the performers really kept their showmanship up for the entire show   good job! Night show supposedly great but we never made it that far... :(,3
"We went to Disneyland on a busy month, but on a weekday (Thursday). When we arrived it was still relatively quiet for a Disneyland. We made the huge mistake of not taking photos with all the characters first. Instead, we went straight to the Lion King show.By around 3 4PM the lines to take photos with Mickey Mouse and all the princesses got too big that we diddon't even stand chance. Which was a shame. But we still got some photos taken with other characters. It was pretty stressful running from one place to another to line up for rides and attractions. And to find a table during meal times.Tip:1. Go during low season if you can.2. PLAN your visit ahead.3. It's impossible to get on all the rides and shows and to take photos with all the characters in one day. So just enjoy what you can.",3
"After visiting Europe and USA it was a little disappointing that there wasdon't many adult rides, although it was great to see young children being excited about the park. We stayed for the lighting of the Christmas Tree and expected the procession of Disney characters to follow straight away but it diddon't and we with menu others left, because of the confusion. Great to see real snow with the lighting of the Tree. ",3
"This was a great place for me prior to my first time to visit a Disney Land. I went in June and honestly the weather was terrible. It was so hot and sunny and there was hardly any place to cool off if you need a rest after the whole day there. The games were not quite impressive and my worst experience was our 2 hour queue for a game in 110 degree summer heat. Anyways I believe little children would enjoy it better than I do because, I mean, which children would say no to mickey mouse and disney princesses? If I had another chance to go there, I would definitely pick another time, probably in the spring or fall. And make sure to get a nice position on the street 2 hours before if you want a good view of the parade.",3
This Disneyland is significantly smaller than the ones in the US.  There are one day discount tickets for anyone over 65 (just make sure to have an id to prove age).  We took the Disneyland Line (Mtr) to get there.,3
Typical Disneyland except the small area. Very accessible by train from all corners of HK. Very crowded and some adults fight with kids to get ahead in Q. Please hold on tight to your young kids to avoid being pushed over by over zealous adults.,3
Disney land Hong Kong is a fun place to be. The attraction is mostly aimed at young children though. We found that only a few rides were targeted for adults. However there are some amazing shows and extra things to do other than the rides. The lighting of the tree was so much fun and we enjoyed the lion king show. If you go in the morning when it opens you will be able to do all the rides. The one really good thing is the variety of food. It's not all burgers and chips. ,3
"I always take my kids to Disneyland 1 2 times a year. They love & enjoy, especially the night paray & the fireworks. Dodon't miss it. Only is the food is quite costly & taste so so...... Compare Disneyland in Tokyo, the food there is so much attractive & good. Even adults would love it.",3
"Great park, smaller scale, very cute. We went first week of December, really short wait times for rides which was a bonus. Diddon't use fast pass at all in this park. However, not quite as pristine as other Disney parks. Having had annual passes for Tokyo Disney, HKG just doesdon't stand up. While both are crowded, busy parks, the cultural differences between the two show in ways such as staff and guest attitude. The Japanese are polite, clean and meticulous is all I will say.",3
"We usually go to Disney in Florida so we're spoiled, but we still enjoyed the rides and strolling through Hong Kong Disneyland. The is the second time we've been to Disneyland Hong Kong this year and there have been some improvements. They're also celebrating their 10th anniversary.",3
"This is the 2nd time I've been to Hongkong Disneyland. 1st time was in 2007.Not much changes except for some new rides. A new garden is in the making (yet to open).Typical kiddy rides. Its more fun when there's a kid around.2 rides that's more fun in my opinion: Space mountain and Parachute.The crowd is atrocious. Too many people in the theme park. Can forget about photo taking with Disney characters. The queue is very long too. Conclusion: Visit HK disneyland once will do. Even after 8 years to revisit, there's no surprise element in the themepark.",3
"Maybe I'm spoiled by disneyworld Orlando but this place was very small and DEFINITELY did not have the Disney feel. Cast members were just doing their job and after waiting 10 minutes in line to get our picture taken with a character we were told she needed a break. Fair enough but the Chinese person behind us just went up and spent the next 1 2 minutes taking pictures with the character. When I questioned the cast member when they allowed that family to take pictures after denying us I got the typical blank stare that I am used to in Shanghai. If you live in China and your kids havedon't been to Disney and you dodon't want to go to any of the other disneys then I guess I would say go. If you have any other choice I would explore it first. If you dodon't live in the Asia pacific area I would recommend staying away as between how small this Disney is and how rude Asia people can be (its the culture and not a personal thing) I think your vacation time is better spent elsewhere. The only good thing I have to say is that from 10:00 12:00 we diddon't wait in any lines so I would recommend going as early as possible,",3
I went there and forget to bring a dozen pieces of Steam bunI have to left it at luggage service it's cost 90 HKD. No coin locker. They charge 90 HKD with every size then it's not fair compare with other place that have a coin locker that you can pay by size and by time,3
"If you have small children then this is ideal as there is plenty to keep them occupied. For the older Disney fans it really is very small from the castle to the rides on offer. It is still true Disney though with the Dumbos , parade and characters out and about. Would recommend going mid week as there were few queues and it only took a few hours rather than the whole day.",3
"Small attraction in Hong Kong, considering this is a Disney  Not to many attraction are available. The park is designed to develop Dinsey brand on children, and has very limited options for adults",3
"If you have been to Disney World then this will surely not live up to the same expectations, however, we are not in the USA. This park does the trick for kids but adult rides are limited.",3
"Went to HK for the day, 1 day was enough. The park is smaller than disney world in Florida. I was there in Nov 2015. I cadon't imagine the heat in the summer. The lines to meet the characters were long, mickey was 2hrs...I did manage woody and buzz. The parades were good, but expect a lot of standing in one place to hold your spot. The rides were tamer compared to USA. I did ride the runaway train. easy coaster. space mountain was a direct copy.Good for 1 day one time.",3
The smallest Disneyland I have seen but all of the Disney Feeling is catching you right behind the Entrance!   Enjoyable and family designed.  The big different to the US Parks is also that your feet wodon't be hurt in the evening..,3
"Having been to Disneyland in California and Disneyworld in Florida, I was expecting a fairly similar park in Hong Kong.......the atmosphere is the same but the park is certainly not as big nor does it contain many decent rides. Food and souvenirs very overpriced. Overall a nice experience for our friends who have never been to a Disneyland, but for us, being able to compare, we weredon't fussed",3
I have been here for few times...  This trip fall in rain and not much presentation from Disney  Enjoy the food in chinese restaurant  We have selected few set menu   Also having tea time there,3
"We visited as two adults and having been to Disney in Florida I expected the same. Whilst the park itself was beautifully maintained it is quite small and is geared towards children. There are only two or three rides that are suitable for the older 'kids'   the run away train and Space Mountain. Dodon't get me wrong we had a good time but it wasdon't like Dreamworld in Aus which is suitable for all ages. The optimum age would be anywhere from little children to young teens.As two adults I probably woulddon't go back unless we took our child with us. You can definitely get around in half a day easily.Couple of things that were disappointing, many of the restaurants were closed and some of the sections were closed or closing early for the day.",3
"I wasdon't expecting to be blown away, but I still think that disneyland was a little too overpriced for what's there. The park is quite small and there's not tonnes to do and see, but maybe I should have gone with kids for a better value day!",3
"I expected the place will be magical like how it is advertised but its not. Only space mountain and Tarzan's place is nice. The experience you'll get is not worth the ticket price, its expensive for what I've experienced and seen. or maybe I just expected more.",3
"Park is quite small with many zones. Not so many rides which make the queue super long, better plan ahead on which ride has fast pass or which zone you wanna go first. We were there with no kids, so nothing excite us. What I dodon't like is park seem lack of staff, especially information staff that normally will be around in the park. We only found few of them. Understand that it's a lot of Chinese visitors which make even more difficult to queue   line up but I would expect more management from the park on this.",3
"We have just returned from our trip to Disneyland over the weekend and the weather at noon time was HOT. For those travelling with young children you might wanna bring a hat for them (or even an umbrella). Use your FAST pass if possible to avoid queuing in the hot sun.Most of the rides were suitable for a 3 year old (except those at tomorrowland). Photo taking with Mickey and friends was available all day long (but you have to QUEUE). We were disappointed that there weredon't many nice spots for phototaking compared to the one in Tokyo (where you could even go into Minnie's house) where each and every corner was kawaii. Food was expensive! Be prepared to pay at least HKD135 for a set meal. To avoid the crowds at lunch time you may want to go earlier eg at 1130am or 130pm.The street parade started at about 730pm. You'll have to gather early around the main street area if you want to get a good spot to take photographs. It's about 40 minutes so there might be nothing much to do thereafter (if you want to wait to catch the fireworks at 9pm), especially if the kids are already tired after a long day. ",3
The park was OK   more for kids I'd say as the rides were smaller and the park itself was small.  Multiple changes on the MTR meaning it wasdon't the easiest place to get to from where we were staying on Hong Kong island.,3
2 teenage girls and I travelled by MRT to Disneyland from Mong Kok. Th is is easy and inexpensive compared to taxi or via a tours company.The entry fee is expensive compared to Universal Studios in Singapore. The high cost continued inside with a bottle of Sprite at HKD30 and an average meal at HKD180.There are limited rides compared to other amusement parks in Asia.PositivesWe went on a Wednesday and as such the lines for each of the rides were small with the average waiting time less than 5 minutes.,3
Was very disappointed when arrived at Disney Land. Doesdon't look like the advertising.  Was not abel to get a picture of my daughter of 3 year with Michey an Mimie mouse. We did a long trip special for this.,3
"Let me tell you that my experience is a bit skewed after having been to DisneyWorld in Florida and DisneyLand in California. As I was in Hong Kong over a weekend for business, I decided to check out what DisneyLand Hong Kong was all about. The park is very easy to get to, just a couple of train rides from central Hong Kong. On an interesting note, I was approached by two young women on the train for a picture. It wasdon't until later did I realize that I, myself, was a bit of a tourist attraction, being a tall, white American male. Anyway, the park is typical of Disney quality. I will warn you, however, that you can probably go through the park and rides in a 1 2 day or full day depending upon the crowd size. There were a number of rides like  Its a Small World , Space Mountain, and others. However, if you're expecting the size and ride availability as the Disney parks in the US, you will be disappointed. The staff was friendly, the park was clean, and I had a nice time, but you're probably looking at a day (max) at the park.",3
"My wife and I took our 3 1 2 year old (twins) grandchildren to Disney Honk Kong and we were very excited for this visit all together. We arrived early in the day and had a great morning going on rides, seeing Cinderella, Anna and Elsa and Snow White. We then decided to stop for lunch in tomorrow land. As the food in these parks are generally similar we figured anywhere we went the food would be OK. We were not expecting a wonderful meal, however we did expect to find edible food. We ordered 2 fish sandwiches, 1 fried chicken platter and one hamburger. The fish tasted terrible, the chicken was chunked meat, and the hamburger meat was unrecognizable. For almost $80.00 USD$ this meal was a total ripoff. Do yourself a favor when going to HK Disney. Bring your own food.",3
"As part of my spare sat in Hong Kong it was recommended me to visit this attraction. It is verte well kept up to Disney standards. I recommend to attend of travellinf with chisten,0 as the attractions are focused in kids not in adults.",3
"After visiting Japan for 10 days and Osaka universal studio for a day, we stopped at Hong kong for a brief period of 3 days and tried to experience the Halloween at HK Disney land. We booked tickets through internet and reached the place at 6.30 pm using public transport. While the destination is easily accessible, we failed to get the feeling of Halloween at HK. The Halloween feel at Osaka Universal Studio took a upper hand. After spending time up to midnight and enjoyed some of the rides and night show, the adventure land for Halloween has been a big disappointment.",3
"I've been to Disneyland in Hong Kong, Paris and Anaheim and found this one to be a little sub standard compared with the others. The rides are more for younger kids, not very scary. It's a very small park though and had no lines to get into the attractions so this was great.",3
I felt the park was too small. Not many rides here for the cost and most rides were for children. Frozen was a new ride and they only had very limited tickets given out in the morning.We went on rainy day so there wasdon't much chance for photography with the characters.Rides were closed and there was still 2 hours to wait for the fireworks. Eventually we opted not to wait as there was absolutely nothing to do.,3
"The HK Disneyland is small. I went with my 9 year old son and other than the Space Mountain roller coaster, he found the place a bit boring.",3
"I enjoyed the journey to Disneyland on the special train and it was an enjoyable day,  I diddon't have young kids with me, who I think would enjoy it more .",3
"last time visit on September 26 '2015 just want to see a new LED parades ,, too bad they canceled the parades due to bad weather :( .  some of venues are closed , they explained had a private event",3
"This park was fun for the kids but turned out to be rather small in size for a Disney Park, finished everything in roughly 5 hours.",3
"Visited with family on 03 October 2015. Was very disappointed as all external rides were shut due to typhoon. Money wasted. Also, the Disney land seemed to be very ordinary. Disney land in Paris and USA are much much better.",3
"The park is a much smaller version of the Disneyland of LA or Disneyworld of Florida. We enjoyed it but missed see the complete park that we had seen several time in California. The shows were wonderful and the staff was very good, helpful and always pleasant and caring to the kids that were so excited to see their favorite Disney Characters",3
"Recently visited Disneyland HK with 8 year old in tow. Entry price seemed high but prepared to pay for the experience. Unfortunately the experience diddon't live up to expectations. It diddon't take long for waiting times on all rides to be 1 hour and access to eateries limited due to crowd numbers. When we did finally get to eat the prices were outrageous  I guess that's what you can get away with when you have a captive audience! We did really enjoy the Lion King show and the parade was great, so not all bad. Overall I thought the target audience was very much around the 4 to 8 year old, nothing much for older kids. For much better value we also visited ocean world HK where price was cheaper, rides and experiences much more appealing. My advice  skip Disneyland and spend your money at ocean world !",3
"We had been to HK Disneyland about 4 years ago and because of several attractions, we decided to have another a look and our daughter was a lot older to experience some of the attractions. Nothing had changed though and some areas were starting to look a little tired. The atmosphere was still great and the hours flew by. We actually wanted to see the parade and the fireworks. The parade is fun to watch but a lot shorter than they had advertised on the website. It said 40 minutes but we got around 20 minutes. The fireworks were also fun to watch but this is definitely a place for the kids.Even though it is looking its age, I could not think of any child that would not have fun there. Plenty of rides, attractions and photo opportunities with the characters of Disney.",3
"With not a vast area, Honk Kong Disneyland doesdon't have enough room for everyone. I recommend you should start to play in the early morning and late afternoon if you want to enjoy fun if you would not like to wait for so long for each play",3
"Smaller than other Disney Lands but the parade of lights the best, great fireworks  The train needed more stops",3
"Quite small compared to other Disney parks world wide, but is a nice getaway for the day if you like Disney Characters.",3
"It's still a magical place for kids and adults alike. We went on a Thursday afternoon and it wasdon't too crowded. The queues to the rides were reasonable and thus waiting time wasdon't annoying. However, I visited another theme park in Osaka last year and found the guest relations staff in Osaka more helpful than HK Disney's staff. We went with a family with a 2 year old child. As we were queuing to watch Mickey's PhilharMagic 3D show, we asked for the directions to the train ride. It was just behind 2 attractions from the theater. However, the theater staff diddon't mention that train rides were only until 5.30PM. We could've taken the train ride first then watched the 3D show later. So, we missed the train ride. Then we coulddon't wait for the fireworks at 8.30PM so we asked if the characters would be meeting and greeting the people. The staff said the characters would be coming out at 9.30PM. it was just 6.30PM that time! As we were about to exit the park, we saw people seated in the pavement and all over the place. When we asked another staff, he said that the characters will parade at 7.30PM. The staff we inquired from could have mentioned this to us. because of these, I rate the park just average.",3
"The best close up fireworks I've ever seen in my travels.ONE thing to do here is to stay till 8.30 pm to watch fireworks! There are so many attractions and rides to play and see. I simply love watching the parades. Try going for all of them. Take a map and schedule of the shows with you or else you wodon't be able to catch up with time. Queues for the ride I'd say moderate given that I went on a Saturday afternoon. Dodon't expect too much for the indoor roller coaster rides. In my opinion, they were anti climax. I was expecting a slow ascend and quick drop  ( So I recommend going for all of the performances including the parades, Lion King, Stitch and etc.",3
I think the Hong Kong Disneyland is one of the smaller in the the world. The people from mainland China are stucking in the park. They are talking lound and spilting every where. It never can compare with the other Disneyland so far.,3
"Was disappointing from a personal point of view, there are only a few rides and i would rate the most extreme a 6 10. Great for kids with all disney characters around. Easy access via MTR from HK",3
"Its my first Disney park visit so was excited, but diddon't find much adult rides and activities.Best place to visit with kids off course but do carry umbrella(in my thinking )on sunny days because it's too hot. And be ready for long walks :)And I found more shopping Disney shops then rides.Well connected with metro tube but less options for taxi to return.",3
"smaller size disneyland compare to the States or Japan. good to young kids. with older kids, think Ocean Park would be more for them. A must is the 4D cinema. food on the expensive side.. but it is the theme park. Both time we went during the day, but have notice people coming later to beat the heat. ",3
Visited with my family (no school going children). i guess it's more suitable for those with young children. The rides are limited for adults. I was just happy that we went on a weekday and there wasdon't any crowd. We queued 10 minutes max for rides. The park was clean and the best part was shopping for souvenirs. The staff were friendly and spoke adequate english. The parade was great to catch too! I've been to Disneyland in Tokyo and i gotta say the Japanese one is better :),3
"Parade was fantastic,  show was good, food just average.  Overprice souvenirs,  but that's what you expect in theme park.",3
"Went to Disneyland yesterday, my first time. Was quite good but I had expected a bit more. Quite a few things weredon't opened. You had to pay to get a photo of the characters, you coulddon't just get a photo yourself. I thought you would have the characters just wondering around. The rides were quite good, but does cost Aust 100 dollars so not cheap.the parade at night is worth staying for was excellent. The fire works too were good!A good experience , but would work out expensive with kids as that's what it's for!",3
Not very impressed by Disneyland Hong Kong. This park did not feel like Disney at all. Atmosphere felt so sterile and cast members were rude unhelpful and unobliging.There is lack of shad ed areas throughout park and it got very hot out there. Food outlets very average ,3
"This was our 5th Disneyland we had visited, we had been to every Disneyland in the world, and unfortunately this was the most disappointing, it diddon't have the magic feel of all the other Disneyland's, and the castle was boarded up as it was under repair. If you want the real free of a magical Disneyland California is the best one!",3
entry fee was quite expensive and it was really crowded. the waiting time for each ride was about 45 mins and there wasnt enough shaddy areas for resting. the only plus point was the fireworks at the end of the day.. at least i know where the majority of my entry fee went,3
"This was my first trip to a Disneyland, so i was so excited and it was great, but a little disappointing. Quite small and we had most of it covered in approx 2 hrs. There are only a few adult rides, mostly things for kids to do and families, but the few rides were fun. Now i want to go to all the others and see what they are like?",3
"Our first Disneyland experience with our 3 year old daughter. We went on a weekday when the park was surposed to be quieter. When we arrived not long after 10am we meets large cues with only two thirds of the ticket office open. 45 minutes we waited to pay to get in. As you could tell by looking around most the girls going were wearing some kind of Frozen clothing and there was going to be a lot of interest in the Frozen village, one of the main reasons we were taking our daughter. After getting our bearings and reading the site map we had to fight for we headed to the Frozen village as there is a small amount of tickets for each show allocated on a first come basis. We arrived at 11.15am to be told all tickets had been given out so if we wanted to see the show and enter the village we would have stand and wait...you should get into the 2.30pm we were told, so they expect you to stand for 3 hours in the blazing sun with a 3 year old. We left to see some of the rest of the park and came back around 5pm to try to get one of the later shows...we still had to stand for nearly two hours but at least it was cooler then. The show was quite good as was meeting Olaf and the sleigh ride...but they closed the indoor snow village before we had chance to go play. There must be a better way to organise this..the rest of the park was quite good, we stayed to closing at 9pm but only managed to get on 8 rides and grab a quick burger in this time (10 hours)...you need a two day ticket if you want a chance to go on most of the rides...expensive for 8 rides and a short show...",3
As one of those people who has been to American Disneylands as well as the one in Paris I find this one ridiculously over crowded. One hour plus waits at not only rides but even restaurants. It has all the basic things that Disneylands have. The parades are nice too.,3
"Wow! Where do I start? The Cast Members are uncharacteristically rude, unhelpful and do NOT enforce the  No Selfie Sticks  rule. Other park guests push shove spit and urinate in the trash cans   no spreading of Disney Magic here   just germs. We are BIG Disney fans and have visited the Orlando and Paris parks numerous times, we went with an open mind and whilst the park and rides are cute and pleasing the people are most definitely not.",3
I am a disney lover (and annual pass holder)So as you can imagine I was crazy excited to go to Hong Kong disney! It was cute and well thought out...but in no way does it compare to wdwI was disappointed but if you have never been to Orlando I'm sure this is a very nice day,3
"I'm sorry I have to rate a visit to a Disney property as only average, but do to the exstensive renovations and limited ride avalibility, I have no choice. On the upside it looks like future visitors will have an opportunity at an expanded park with more attractions. 2016 and beyond should be great!",3
"Enjoyed the visit however the trek there from HK central was long then when you arrive the lines to the rides were massive although loved the roller coaster, tea cups and the boat safari cruise ride. Make sure take lots of water and wear good walking shoes... Happy got my Mickey Mouse ears although everything not that cheap . Am happy for the experience.",3
Not so good as it is publicised. You have to wait in a queue to get clicked with the disney characters which can be hours long. Rides are good enjoyed a lot. Waited for the special disney parade but it was cancelled due to rain. overall not so good experience.,3
"Its a fun day out, however there were too many people there, mainly China mainland tour group. I think also you dodon't want to go during the school holidays as Im told the crowds are huge. Considering how long ago this park opened, I think there should be more attractions. Like most amusement parks there is a height minimum for the kids to go on some rides. Overall a good day when we went which was on the first weekday just after the school holidays in 2014. We will go back again for sure and see what has changed if any.",3
"Been there in May 2015 on a long weekend with much of an expectation. You have to take a special Disney themed train from Sunny Bay station MTR station. Entrace of the park is so so, nothing great. Rides and attraction were also not too great, Ocean Park is much mush better than this. You take picture with disney characters only at a specific time on the day, that too after queuing for almost an hour. These characters dodon't roam around the park freely. Much hyped Disney Parade was cancelled due to rain, so much of a disappointment there.Overall, I wont recommend this place, specially at price tag of 500 HKD, not at all worth it. Go to Ocean Park, cheaper and most importantly, better!",3
"I turned 50 so decided to be a big kid for the day and maybe get a picture with a princess or two. This place is overcrowded, full of rude locals, overpriced for food & drink, looooong ques and unless your desperate or filthy rich, the souvenirs will take a big chunk out of your budget. We waited for a parade and got a spot in the front, this was short lived as others use their kids to force past you and then follow themselves, in all a waste of time & money. Obviously if this is your thing, go for it, characters available for photos ha! good for kids I suppose as they dodon't have to pay.",3
"Overshadowed by the goliath Disneyland in America, and Disneyland in France you cadon't help but feel a little underwhelmed when visiting Hong Kong Disneyland. It's still a visit to Disneyland nonetheless. The Mickey Mouse themed trains are excellent, but are definitely catered to the smaller Chinese populace. The Park itself isdon't massive but has enough to make a half day out of it.",3
Expected to meet Mickey but so sad.. i can not take picture with him.. so long queue  and finally just going around the park. one time visit is enough for me.,3
Its too little. Not that good. Definately choose the other hk park that os way better. If you know disney usa this one will dissapoint you,3
It is not what sp  cial Park. Disneyland is Famous All over The World.   This One is convenient To go as it has th   train station Disneyland.    You visit it if u lov   Disneyland,3
"The cast members are not as profession as the jpn one. Dont see any smiling staff, instead I heard foul language from the chef of the restaurant. Shows didnt have any enhancement since its opening, so, I dont think the company want to save the revisiting customer.",3
I visited 3 times since Disneyland Hkg open 10 years ago. I saw too many Mainland China visitors with their habits and attitude. The parks crowded with these guys feels like I'm not with USA Disneyland atmosphere.,3
"i took my family for one day visit to hongkong Disney land. Tickets were expensive. Area was overcrowded with very poor resting places. Games were very difficult to get into them. Waiting time for some attractions exceeded two hours, sometimes three hours.weather was very hot and it was one of the worst song trips we had. Only two small games were played by my daughters. The were disappointed when the wanted to go to the frozen village at 1.20 pm and were told all tickets gone. You can wait till 5 pm for a possible chance. We went home tired and disappointed.",3
"Having been to the two parks in America and the one in Paris, whilst in Hong Kong it was a must to come here. Obviously a much smaller scale to Anaheim and a few of the favourites are not here but it definately runs along the Disney theme. Nice touch is the Disney train you catch to reach the park, definately gets you in the mood for a Disney packed day. I just found it very expensive and ended up not buying anything in the park to take home with me which was disappointing. I would still recommend to go, especially if you havedon't been to a Disney park before but perhaps pack your lunch and be prepared to fork out heaps for a momento. Word of warning, if there is a typhoon warning do not go to the park. They say many things are still open but most things are closed and they still charge you full price to get in. Many disappointed children walking around and some very disappointed Aussies!! We ended up going again and it was much more enjoyable.",3
"Had an enjoyable day   aside from the interruptions described below   walking around in the park, which is finely decorated to let your imagination run free. You step into a whole other world once you enter the park. As with every Disneyland park, every detail is taken into consideration and fits within a magical world, from small details like doorknobs and trashbins to large castles and jungles. What could have been a great experience was unfortunately marred by several interruptions that seemed to be either planned or badly managed. The Lion King show was really good, with a number of talented dancers and singers in impressive costumes   definitely a must see   but it was interrupted twice with what appeared to be planned interruptions. All the dancers ran out twice, giving the (perhaps malfunctioning) mechanical animals time to move to a different position, but it honestly ruined the flow and experience of an otherwise fabulous show. Because it seemed planned, I'm not sure this was just a one time unlucky occurrance. The other  interruption  came at the street parade, which was suddenly cancelled 5 minutes before the show was to start, with something like  unstable weather  being the reason. Problem was that it had not rained all day, diddon't rain, and the weather forecast had not changed. Maybe the mechanics cadon't handle rain... but then honestly, you plan for it. Conclusion? If you come during the rainy season, even if it doesdon't rain, you may not get to see the shows. When I pay top ticket prices to visit an amusement park (499 HK$ for adults), I expect the quality to be topnotch, every day. If I had paid less to visit this place, I would give more leeway, but if they set expectations and prices high, they need to live up to those expectations. I coulddon't shake the feeling that for the park this was  just another day  that needed to get over with. Know that queues were long ish (20 40 minutes), even on a weekday, so bring patience a book. Tried the Jungle River Cruise (quite charming and casual), the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (cute, mostly for kids), Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars (not as scary as it looks), Mystic Manor (really well made) and Space Mountain (not as crazy as the one in LA). Most, if not all rides are kid friendly. Fireworks at the closing of the park is definitely worth staying for, but expect to take a while to get back to Hong Kong city as everyone will leave at the same time. Food is expensive, e.g. water comes at 25 HK$ (the free drinking water provided in the park doesdon't taste good) and icecream at some 32 HK$.",3
"Went along just to say I've been to Disneyland but wasdon't as good as I thought it would be. The shows were ok(check out the Stitch Interactive)but I'm I could be swayed by the A C being such a hot,humid day. Save your money and go to Ocean Park.",3
Crowded ....bad food....long ques ...but lovely atmosphere and  nice for a family day....try to avoid in summer,3
"Disneyland   what to say? It was a good day out fireworks show is at 9pm daily having being at Disneyland nice and early at 10 exploring the island it is more for kids rather than adults, each ride will take at least 30 mins to queue up same as the food stalls try to bring your own water etc as prices are automatically trebled once inside compared to outside. Having visited all the world's and gone on numerous rides feeling tired in the heat looking at the time for it to show 5pm I decided to leave and head back to the hotel via mtr which was great, as I diddon't want to wait 4 hours to see a fireworks showVerdict: go f you have have 5 6 days stay in HK as it takes the whole day off you.",3
"Having visited Disney Paris and Orlando, all I can say is that if you have visited these two amusement parks, then bother with this one unless you have nagging kids. If you pressed for time rather go to Ocean Park.This is a watered down version of a Disney Park. There is no wow factor unlike Orlando. It's is small and looks tired. Some rides are familiar but with the exception of a few characters which you see from time to time, you could very well be in another  no name  brand park.Really glad I did not choose to stay in the park.Only go if you really have to.",3
"We came here four families with tweens and one toddler. The day was exceptionally hot. Standing in line takes about 49 minutes or more under shade and partial air conditioning. The kids enjoyed it all and wanted to go on all rides and hug all Disney figures. The lunch places were enormous and very loud, but food was nice and not so awful American as one would expect, that line also took 49 minutes. The kids loved it all including the special Disney train and station. As a cynical father I found it all rather crowded and the rides were about the same I rode in Anaheim 34 years ago and they reallly could need a technichal uppdate. I respect Disney for promotiing better food.",3
"too expensive entrance fee, not so many options for adults ride. totally for kids only. if you are young age there are some ride to try, in the toy story section and grizzly section.",3
Hong Kong Disneyland is not as good as Tokyo Disneyland. Entrance is the same as any Disney but smaller and I think that Disney Paris is yet better than this. There are lots of tourist from China coming to Hong Kong Disneyland and they are really pushy and unmanned that they jump the cure but the Disney staff are not present to control the cure and I would blame the staff who does not do anything. I would skip Hong Kong Disney and choose Tokyo Disneyland anytime than getting stressed. ,3
"Went there with our two kids (one was 4 and one was 2 ) in July. It was great to catch the subway to Disneyland. My 4 year old was very excited to see Mickey mouse' ears on the train. We only got the one day tickets. But we think you probably need two days to see everything there. One thing we think is really disappointing is for some shows, you have to go to the places and make a reservation first thing once you arrive at Disneyland. Otherwise you wodon't be able to see the show. You can probably still go in if you are happy to line up for 2 hours. As we traveled in July, it was stinky hot. There was no way for us to line up for 2 hours to see the show with one toddler and one 4 year old. So in the end we diddon't end up going to many shows or rides. The Disney Paint the Night show was fantastic but it was a little bit short. Our advice is if you want to go there, you really need to plan it in advance and know where to go and what to see.",3
"First timers would love it but if you   ve seen other Disneylands esp. Anaheim, US, this park will appear a big rip off. No toon town, no princess. Staff is not supportive and tend to favor locals. At Frozen land while you will be shooed away citing reservation passes are over, locals will get quick access. You will sweat it out in sun standing long hours in queues while locals will simply come and get in hence prolonging your wait. But once inside, Frozen land is a boon and a great theatrical (short) depiction of Frozen movie. A small artificial snow park to chill and do sledge carting and you may click with a few toon mannequins. Mickey magic theatre show and Winnie the pooh rides are great which kids will thoroughly enjoy.Not much variety on cuisine. I personally enjoyed the caramel popcorn, a must try.If you   re in Hong Kong, Ocean park is many times better and bigger than Disneyland. If you   ve already been to Ocean Park, don   t waste your money in Disneyland. If not, plan Ocean Park after Disneyland to rein in disappointments. Not a place for visitors who are used to polite staff and cordial behavior in queues.",3
"If you've been to Disneyland California and Disney World Florida, dodon't expect too much in Disneyland HK. They still lack other amusement rides which I enjoyed in California and Florida.I still like shopping at the Disney store whether in HK or in California but sometimes I think Disney in USA is cheaper because they would bargain sale some stocks which are still of attractive good quality. In Disney HK, it still remains HK$ 215 to 235 for a shirt which is PHP1,290 to PHP1,410.Our local travel agency would charge us PHP3,700 for Disneyland ticket. But if I am in California, my Disneyland ticket will only cost me $41 or PHP1,845.Some toilets in Disneyland HK became smelly with pee in the afternoon, They only have very few drinking fountain and it looks old and rusting. Unlike in Disneyland California where the management there always keep the toilets clean and drinking fountain are almost everywhere to protect customers from dehydration.",3
"We went to Disney as a big family trip and we ended up leaving the place at 3PM.All the major spots were too crowded. I had to wait for at least 20 minutes for each attraction. The kids was tried after 2 3 rides. They should limit visitors per day or try to build more rides. I've been to Universal Orlando before and had such a better experience.Anyway, dodon't forget to use fastpass, at least it can help you go through the line a bit faster.",3
"If you have not experienced a Disney Park, you will love. Especially if you have small children. As we had experienced Disneyland in Anaheim a number of times we found this park small. But loved the night time parade.",3
"Disneyland is amazing, this one is just slightly less so. Compared to the American Disneys, all the rest are small, but this one seemed smaller than Paris. The staff were friendly and helpful, the queues for rides all said 45 minutes but we're only 15. There seems to be a lot fewer characters walking around, though this could have been heat related. Unfortunately, we coulddon't get into the Frozen Wonderland, which had a 3 hour wait time, if you want to do this I would recommend going there first and getting your ticket and returning. Getting there on the MTR was really easy and hassle free. ",3
"Perhaps the most interesting part of the visit was watching the main land Chinese tourists struggle with the concept of queuing , push you young children to the front of the queue then go find them , simply push to the front of a long queue because you had a young child, pretend to study the paining and wall paper to push your way along a corridor .Easy to get to on the MTR, ok early in the morning and again late afternoon as people appear to disappear for dinner",3
Well this place good when go with kids in week end.   When I was there just they open indoor not out door because of storm.   I would say it's okay that's it.,3
"Disneyland Hk during our visit april 2013 is kinda crowded, photo opportunity with Mickey and Minnie Mouse took almost 1 hour because of the very long line. Better to get and pay for a VIP pass to be in front of all the lines (photo opps and rides) as it really get so crowded. But of course visiting this place gives you an explainable feeling, we all grew up liking mickey mouse isdon't it? ",3
"Park is great, well maintained, good service, but it can ve super crowded and on a Rainy day it can get a little uncomfortable. But you have to visit HK Disney while in HK !",3
"Have visited HK Disney in 2006 before we had a daughter. Last month brought our daughter here as a surprise for her 6th birthday. I felt it was better in 2006. This isdon't too big or too small. If you reach there when it opens in the morning on a not so crowded day, you can easily cover all the attractions in a day. It was so hot last month which was also quite uncomfortable for us. They have all kind of food inside including Indian which was nice. The paint with lights parade in the evening was very good.There were no characters on the main street. We diddon't know that they will give coupons in advance for the Frozen show. When we went there they said it's all over and the queue waiting now is for the next show which is 3 hrs later. We tried it 3 times with no luck. Our daughter was little disappointed. And then we saw Anna and Elsa posing for pictures beside the Frozen shop. There were only 2 3 people in queue. When we sent our daughter they told that we need to have coupon for this too. It wodon't take more than 10 secs for a pic but they refused. This happened twice. But overall our daughter had good fun as it's her first time.",3
Have been there quite many times because of kids but recently found it boring. Firstly need to wait really long time for any ride. Some rides need to wait over one hour. Whole area is really small. Food is expensive. You hardly find a place to sit in. Everywhere packed. Most people from mainland China. Well it's good for kids and first time travelers. ,3
There was many new attractions and loads of fun for the young and old. But the hyped up fireworks was kinda over rated. i remembered a better fireworks when i went there when i was younger.,3
"Finally decided to visit HK Disneland this June 2015 & saw for ourselves how small it is compared to the Disneyland in LA. We were a bit disappointed bec. aside from not having a lot of rides, some rides were closed like Buzz light year & Ironman. Also there weredon't too many characters roaming the area unlike our experience in Disneyland LA & Disneyworld Florida. Only saw Merlin, who dashed away after 2 photos were taken; Tinkerbell whom we didnt have a chance to take a photo of bec. they had to cut the line. And Jessie from Toy Story. No Mickey or Minnie Mouse! I hope the management will add more rides in the future.",3
We went on an overcast day which meant the crowds were down and we never had to wait more than 30 mins for rides. We enjoyed all aspects of Disneyland but would probably suggest not arriving there until just before 3pm when the first parade occurs. We were so tired we just coulddon't wait for the evening parade and fireworks which was a little disappointing.,3
We went as a couple and struggled to find much to entertain us. It is very well set up with rides for children and no doubt you would need a few days to get thru everything.,3
I have been to 3 other Disneyland and this is the smallest.  It gets pretty crowded and has some unique feature such as different lines and times for some rides and shows.  So make sure you get in the right line at the right time.,3
"Went with a friend and her young children recently. There's nothing there for Tweens and teens but for young kids it can be magic.However, dodon't go on a Sunday or a public holiday. The park is so crowded and there will be adults pushing past your child to get in a child's ride. It's bizarre. The shows are great.Although the park is smaller than the other disneys   small kids will not be disappointed. Music is piping through sound systems, the characters are much in evidence and it can be magic   especially on a weekday.",3
"Was a bit disappointed   I expected it to be a bit larger and merrier. The staff was very unfriendly and kept pushing the crowd to one side, hours before the parade was to start. The staff managing the characters allowed people to take too much time taking photos. The lines were long and not moving. A lot of construction was taking place. The restaurants were too pricey and limited variety. The best was the ' Lion King'. It was an excellent production.",3
"Went there on a wet day. Good thing is most of the rides diddon't take long in the queue to get on, bad thing is some of the rides are closed. We also missed the Frozen village because all fast passes on that day were gone and we diddon't want to queue up for 2 hours to see a show and then be allowed into the village (would've been nice if they would let people in just to see the village without seeing the show).The Philhar Magic show was cool with all the 3D effects etc but the Golden Mickey was not as exciting. There aredon't enough thrill rides and there aredon't enough rides in really. Tarzan's house was a big let down being so hard to get to and not much to see at all.Staff were not the most professional and their acting were not the best, especially on the boats around the jungle area.Food and drinks are expensive as you'd expect from such touristy places but the quality was not that bad. The annoying thing is that they actually go through your bag to make sure you dodon't bring food in to ensure their business...I'd never been to a Disneyland so I am glad that I have now, probably wodon't go back to this one though.",3
"Disneyland Hong Kong was of course a must do on the trip to HK, and we duly booked in advance, and made our way early to the park. It was a wet day, but that was no dampener to the kids who were really super excited about being there. Though we went on a Monday, when i thought crowds would be relatively fewer, it quickly filled up, and by noon, it was usual to see a waiting time of 20 minutes to 30 minutes or more for most of the interesting rides. While we waded into as many as we could pack in during the day, what i really missed out on was the DIsney shows. Because almost each show needed you to wait for anything between 45 minutes to 2 hours to get in. That to me, leaves visitors with a very clear choice. Visit Disneyland for the shows or the rides. You just cadon't pack in both in a day. Even over two days, it would be difficult if these are usual wait times. I shudder to think what happens on weekends. The really smart strategy would of course be to do the rides in Ocean park, and more of the shows in Disney, where it has a clear edge. Until the Iron Man ride gets ready next year:)Having said that, the park management was impeccable, as you expect from Disney, and we had absolutely no problems at all. One suggestion to Disney would be to perhaps have a separate ticket for the shows exclusively.",3
average location for family with children to enjoy. limited rides and views and sometimes long line going to entrance.,3
"perfect for families with young children,  but compared to the other Disneyland,  this is definitely too small!!  nonetheless.  worth a visit.",3
"Went here with family. Took a long travel from Tsim Sha Tsui area. Around 40 minutes. Got there, if you already bought tickets online, just proceed to guest relation counter. Inside the park, if you go together with young kids, you have to pick the ride that suitable for them. Some rides will make them scary. Like the Grizzly Gulch or the Space Mountain.The food and drink were very expensive in there. One small bottle of mineral water will cost you 50 HKD. Actually you can bring your own drink from outside the park ,just make sure you dodon't bring too many bottle inside your bag.The parade will start at around 3.30pm in the main street if it is not rain on that time.Overall, this theme park suitable for more young kids and since is's small, you can actually finished all the rides in 6   7 hours, depends on the crowds.",3
"seeit is quite good for kiddos, not teenagers. its wish of your kid to take you there coz quite close to india.1. plan well, you can sure finish it easily in day.2. dont even think of wasting second day of staying just to cover all rides n attractions. its quite small3. dont miss micky 4D show, simba show4. Frozen was big disappointmentconclusion: they need to improve quite a lot",3
"Disneyland has a very good business model. They have very good service. But they know how to squeeze every cent off visitors. I spent my whole time there on a hot June weekday and found some ways to save money and enjoy more on weekdays. Here are some reflections as I felt cheated by the business model after my trip:1. The park tends to very crowded in the late morning and early afternoon. This is because most tour groups arrive in the morning and families and youths on holiday tend to go there during these hours. It is hence hardly surprisingly that all the exciting rides or plays take around 20 to 30 minutes waiting time. It is very frustrating when the weather is hot and you will waste a lot of time waiting.2. But I notice something after 4pm. From 4pm, I notice the wait times for the exciting rides were reduced to 5 to 10 minutes for most stations. This is because most of tour groups and students have left. You get a chance to enjoy the stations. More importantly, you avoid the queue and the weather is better around that time. 3. At around 5pm, I notice new entertainment appears. They are people singing on the streets and some new disney characters will suddenly in the evening. Moreover, there is a fireworks display at 7.30pm. I think they are trying to encourage people to spend more and stay in their hotel. Hence, they provide a different set of entertainment to attract this customers to book their overpriced hotels. 4. Another reason why Disneyland has a good business model is the over priced food. A single scoop of ice cream can cost HK $50. Their concept diners and self run fast food chains serve bland burgers at exuberant prices. The taste is not unique from food you can buy in other areas in Hong Kong. Moreover, the queue is very long and frustrating under the hot June weather. As a result, perhaps it is better to go after your lunch. You can avoid the queue and save money on food.5. I made a terrible mistake to buy the tickets online before I go Disneyland. I notice the ticket prices are cheaper when you buy at the Disneyland counter. 6. There are many souvenir shops to attract you to buy more. Some of the shops sell items not found in other souvenir shops. My advice is do window shopping first at the 2 main shops near the entrance. You take note of the prices of things you are interested in and dodon't buy first. Reason is because you have to walk pass those shops again before you leave. So you can buy later. Moreover, it prevents impulse buying because you may find nicer souvenirs at other souvenir shops in Disney theme park. Please bring your own plastic bag as plastic bags in shops are chargeable.7. There are many areas you can take photos with your favourite characters. But each photo is around HK $200. There is an unlimited package at HK$298 that is recommended and worth it. You can go for that as you can print unlimited photos. Through my learning experiences, my recommendation is to go around 2pm after a heavy lunch. You buy the tickets from the ticket counter at Disneyland. After you reach around 2pm, you avoid stations that are popular among youths. You visit performances like Mickey Mouse Awards as there are air con and can hold more people. At around 4pm after you watch the performances, buy sourvenirs and take photos with your disney characters, you will then visit all the exciting rides. This will allow you to save a lot of time on waiting as wait time will be cut around 5 to 10 minutes for most rides. You should complete all the rides by 7.20pm and appreciate the evening activities propping up. After that you can proceed for the 7.30pm parade and fireworks. That will end your day and just in time for dinner outside Disneyland. This programme will help you to save money and time. It will also beat the well crafted Disneyland business model.",3
"It is Disney, so the attraction was great, however the line up is so stupid, in other countries it is already developed the tie ticket, so you need to line up in specific timeline, so you dont have to line up more than 15 minutes. In my case i have to line up for 2 hours for 20 minutes show, it was ridiculous. ",3
"I had compared disney land of hongkong to enchanted kingdom of philippines, and i should say i had more fun in enchanted kingdom.. i was quite diappointed on everything they got, i keep saying thats it?, but i think its also because it was raining the time we visited so some rodes are closed.. but the construction was great. its perfect for kids and not so much for adults..",3
"There was one good ride we did, the rest was kids stuff. Definitely dodon't go in the weekend, many people and long queues...",3
Total hype ...... Ocean park is much better than DL . I mean if you are visiting just for the name sake .... No use . My kids diddon't enjoyed rides . Shops are too expensive . Universal studios of Singapore is 100 times better . Actually DL is more of for small kids .,3
"I was here on the raining day. So bad. Almost everywhere in here are closed. I understanding that's not a problem from the place, but when it rain, the Disneyland is nothing.",3
Hong Kong Disneyland may not be as good as the other Disneyland Parks but it has a decent amount of exclusive rides. Mystic Manor especially is truly amazing. I do have a lot of complaints for it. I think the distance to the entrance is a little bit far. It also rains a lot which sucks. Also there are not too many great rides. Still Hong Kong Disneyland is fun.,3
Be prepared its a mini version of Disney land and can be a bit of a let down. It is crowded but the children there were ecstatic. So if you are in HK and have kids..... Do Go,3
Great for younger kids (8 and under) but for the older ones who want action rides better going somewhere else. Theme parks on the Gold Coast Australia are better in my opinion .,3
"Space mountain is not very impressive...same applies fotr the rest of the attraction.Paris is much more big and impressive for a similar price...some attractions were closed today.Our luck was that there was not many people today, so we could do some of the attraction two or three time in a row.The gold mine thing was fun.Food was average and expensive as usual in this kind of park.",3
We were a little disappointed with Hong Kong Disneyland. We have been to others around the world but this is the one we did not really enjoy. It is obviously set up for young people but very little for older big kids like us. It is relatively new and we did notice that there were more attractions being built but on this day not a lot that attracted us. The train trip there was easy so no problem there.,3
"This park is OK for children but it is too small to be interesting to their long suffering parents.  Long lines, limited attractions and really nothing special.  Save up money and go to Orlando.",3
"We visited Disneyland with our 12 year old son. He enjoyed a lot, but not much to see. Very few rides and it's just a fun filled outing. It's not worth to stay inside Disneyland, as one day is more than enough to look around. It is just a mini Disneyland. Dodon't miss the parade which starts around 7.30 pm, it's really amazing to watch all Disney characters walk around. Overall it would be fun for kids going for the first time.",3
I think this place is famous because of the brand but not really the place. I think this place is a bit outdated during my time of visit. Need refurbishment in riding and the whole area. The journey from downtown to disneyland takes around 1 hour. I came a little bit late but i end up exit a few hours after that.,3
"Very few rides and hardly any rides, which could provide thrill to adults. Nowhere near the Disneyland of Paris or Orlando. Good for just small kids.",3
"We visited on a Saturday (only day we could go) with our thrill seeking 9 & 7 year old plus a more quiet 6 yr old. It suited the 6 yr old perfectly but not enough thrill rides for the older kids,Typical Disney prices for everything and by lunchtime a wave of local visitors made lines over an hour wait time so get there very early. We also could not buy anything in the stores by the time we left at 3 3:30pm due to the stores being so overcrowded   it was really unbelievable!!No food allergies are catered for so pack your own food and the only espresso coffee is from an automated machine and was sadly thrown to the bin after paying.Around 12pm we headed to the Grand Hall area for lunch but not a seat anywhere and people standing next to tables as others ate   we found a park bench in the sun to eat some packed snacks and overpriced fries chips.I would recommend a mid week visit, arrive before opening and watch out for the pushy other visitors. Go to your favourite ride first and expect a wait for very short ride times.Kids will enjoy regardless. Suggest Ocean Park for thrill seekers.",3
Luckily it was not a very crowded day despite being labour day public holiday in HK. However some rides still requires queuing time of around 1 hour. The free fast past is very helpful and would be great if it is available to more rides.There is only about 3 trilling rides for adults and hence insufficient. The air conditioned toilets were heavenly in the hot and humid HK weather.Transport to and fro is very convenient with the MTR and price is reasonable.,3
"I only attended this venue to purchase some Disney Merchandise for my Grand Daughter.My admission price was $16 AU as I am over 65 years of age, yet the normal adult entrance is about $67AU.You have to enter the theme park to purchase merchandise as there are no outlets outside the Park.If I had to pay full price I would not have continued.The park is very small and I think it would be disappointing for both parents and theirchildren.Save a little longer and go to Los Angeles or Orlando Disneylands as Hong Kong is no comparison.I would not recommend it.",3
"As seniors I would not go for the whole day again, in fact I would not go at all again. This park is beautifully manicured, clean, gardens are fantastic. Staff do their best to be upbeat & friendly, but in the humidity,heat & crowds some staff just run out of the   I care attitude . Indian people attending are just rude with their pushing,having to be first demeanour in lines. We arrived by taxi ,5 of us from Canton Rd,Kowloon. $170HKD. The family loved the rides, we loved the shows, you have to be on the ball to ensure you arrive on time for the meet & greet with the characters , as they will only stay a while, then do a changeover as the heat would be too much in the character suits they wear.",3
"Too expensive, we woulddon't paid if we have to pay to get in but we know people who worked there in order to get free entry. Overall is good with kids but there were so many people and things weredon't particularly great. There were a few things that wow us...but overall it was a good experience but definitely did not worth that much.",3
"very packed, long Q for almost all the rides. Foods are kinda over priced and taste so so. Not much exciting rides, too long Q. Amazing fireworks at night tho, but watch out when the fireworks ended. Crowd would push to leave the place.",3
"Personally, Tokyo Disneyland is better than this one, but there is Toy Story Land here which is unique, and I heard that some other stuff are coming upon completion of construction of other phases. Anyhow, if you are a Disney fan, HK Disneyland is enjoyable and you could get different experience compared to other Disneylands in the world (e.g. the shows are different). However, tourists from China keep trying to cut your queue and I think this is the most annoying thing, and if not this, HK Disneyland is good enough, for both adults and children.By the way, if you have time, you may drop by Inspiration Lake nearby. Quite relaxing a place.",3
"Havent been to Disneyland, Hongkong for 5 years now, thought it would have added atractions all these years. Very disappointing. All my four kids (aged 13 21) were not bit impressed or satisfied with our trip, waste of time and money.",3
"I went there to to look at it, without intention of taking any of the rides. It is a typical Disney park, with a lot of attractions, but crowds are very big and lines for most attraction very long.",3
"i am just torn on how I feel. How can you have a castle that is half cardboard? It just feels like they half did it. I am not sure if there is still further development or If it is to be left this way but that signature castle needs to be done.The rides are good, but this more or less feels like a third world Disney. The fast pass idea is only for 2 rides. Did not see many characters walking around.This would have been better if I have never been to Orlando or Anaheim, but once you've been to both American Disney parks, this one still needs a lot of work.",3
"I visit this park on april 26 2015, for me just so so, not many option to play,just okay for younger kids. I paid HK$ 450  pax, expensive , i bought from HKI airportThe meals also expensive , start from HK$ 95  dish, not many stall food optionI more like universal studio singapore.I just curious about disney land,, The staff is friendly",3
"The admission ticket was just raised couple of month before I visit the themes park. This is my 2nd visit after 1st visit 8 years ago. Additional playride is for Toystory land. They are also constructing new facilities that may be available soon. I arrive early in the morning on the weekday, and the visitor is stil not many. I can play any popular ride, such as space mountain, without queuing. Unfortunately, another popular ride mine train was not operated today, including lion king show. The golden mickey show is fabulous. To ensure a good seat, you need to stand in queue at least half an hour before the scheduled show.",3
It was my first ever visit to any Disney land and Hong Kong is a disappointment after all you hear about Orlando Florida. Maybe its just because its the first Phase but its is only set up for the age group of below 8 years old. Which for that its OK but teenage kids and adults forget it...,3
"My kids had fun, but my husband and I got really tired from the lining up and carrying things for the kids. Try to avoid going to the Hong Kong Disneyland after April, the weather starts to warm up, along with the long line ups, I cadon't seem to enjoy this attraction very much.",3
"I have been to Disney World (Orlando, Florida) and the experience in Disney HK cannot be compared. 50% of the attractions that Disney Orlando provides is not there in HK. Only saving grace was Tinkerbell. Hats off to the HK Transportation system(MTR) which is worth appreciating. 1 day is more than sufficient to spend at Disney HK. If you plan to stay back for the fireworks, ensure to check the weather forecast before planning your day. The fireworks are called off even for breezy weather!! There are many options for food inside the park.",3
"Disneyland Hong Kong is smaller than the ones in US, but still worth the visit and also less crowded. Not too many rides for the younger kids (aged up to 5) due to height restrictions.Easily connected to Hong Kong city via the MTR or taxi.Outside food is not allowed and will be taken away at the entry gate.Arrive   enter the park as soon as the park opens to avoid the rush.The park is quiet from 10am to 12pm most of the rides have small lines at this time.Not many rides have the fastpass offer.Needless to say the park will be less busy during a weekday.",3
"Hong Kong Disneyland is too small and too crowded. Lots of mainland tourists there, and behave badly, like cutting line and keeping pushing while waiting.",3
I think Disneyland is for kids. The most of attraction are not made me excited. But I really like the  fireworks huge show at castle. It's very marvelous. Some food in Disneyland is not delicious.,3
"It's my second time of visiting HK Disney after nearly five years. Well, for me still the same except for the Golden Mickey show though i prefer the 4D Mickey show before. There's no Lion king show it's under maintenance. A piece of advice, dodon't go to Disney in the month of march coz mostly they are under going maintenance probably in preparation for the peak season which is April and May. Just glad that it's not my first time or else i've missed something. .",3
"Our second visit to HK Disney. There are some fun rides for the kids, but the park really is very small. It gets very crowded in the late morning so go early and be there when the gates open. Avoid Chinese holiday periods   weekday mornings outside school holidays are best. There are limited, quite expensive food options so we take our own sandwiches.",3
"If you have been to America or Euro Disney you will find this one a disappointment. Great access but generally void of the big rides and shows,staff generally miserable and  not great English in general. On the whole not worth the money",3
"Of course, I was a single guy celebrating my 31st birthday alone when I visited but as a fan of Disneyana and as a writer for children's programming, I thought there was something lacking in terms of the whimsy and magic I've come to expect from Disneyland. This could have also been because many of the buildings   included its centrepiece castle and main street shops   were being renovated at the time but for whichever reason the experience felt cheap and unconvincing. Of course, the rides are still great fun and one area in particular   Mystic Point   would have been incredible had it been much bigger but if you're a completionist who has to choose one full day attraction in Hong Kong, you can easily drop this one.",3
Fairly small Disney park that has only 3 or 4 rides for older kids. This park is best for families with kids under about 10 years of age. Fireworks at end of day were a highlight. Park is open long hours so one day is enough if you are prepared to have a full day. Costs quite a lot more than Ocean Park and not as good. Trades off the Disney name. ,3
Not a lot here for adults. Rides aredon't really thrilling. We went on a rainy day and found that there wasdon't much shelter. Wait times were pretty reasonable and what we expected. I've seen it now and dodon't feel the need to come back.,3
"Been here in late march on a friday.not too crowded.longest queue wait was arnd an hour n a half.With 3 kids under 5 and my sister's 2 boys aged 7 & 8, a total of 5 kids, i had to do lots of homework.First and foremost is to check when is the mainlanders sch holidays :PWe decided to get just a day pass (ive read reviews) it is not as big like the one we went last yr in Anaheim.We managed to get on to 8 rides (arrived here arnd 1030am) although there are some renovations going on.Characters are easy to spot at certain places.They are friendly and cheerful.Staffs are helpful but some of them still dont understand english.The park and the toilets are clean! ",3
"We visited in late March when there seemed to quite a bit of refurbishment going on. The castle had work doing to it which was really disappointing as that's kind of what you go to Disney to see   plus there were a few rides out including the main roller coaster. It was a shame that considering the quite expensive cost of the ticket, we weredon't given any compensation for this.Nevertheless, there was still lots to see and do in the park. Particularly enjoyed the Space Mountain ride and Toy Story section. The parade was decent and just generally strolling around the park is really nice. Funnily enough the train that you get to the park is also a highlight   Mickey Mouse shaped windows and handles on the hand rails   a great way to start the trip!We were four friends around 24 25 years old and while we went to Disney for a bit of nostalgia, we did kind of crave a bit more of the thrill seeking part   and I think others that are looking for this too will be better heading over to Ocean Park, which I wish we did!",3
"We were on a family vacation which included Hong Kong. This park is a little disappointing after having been to California and Florida. It's smaller with fewer rides and only 2 that had Fast Passes (Space Mountain and Winnie the Pooh). We had 2 days to spend there. But after the 1st day, my wife and 15 yr old son diddon't want to go back. I took 2 toddlers by myself. By about 2 pm Winnie the Pooh Fast Passes were gone for both days. It's expensive to boot.",3
"Was excited at the thought that as a family we were going on a trip to Disneyland, something I had always imagined of going to as a child, but even more so now with own children. Whilst Disneyland has certainly got some magical aspects to it, to be honest I was a tad dissapointed. Firstly I'm glad we diddon't spend the extra money staying at the actual hotel, as one day was more than enough time to see the place. I felt the place lacked the effort which you often see depicted in adverts etc. we went on a Thursday after reading reviews regarding crowds on weekends, and I, glad that we did, as most rides etc had wait times of up to 30 mins, which at times can be difficult esp as I have two kids under age of 6. We saw only4 Disney characters walking around in costume (mickey Minnie, but you had to pay to see them), buzz light year and alice in wonderland who diddon't even stop to talk to the children which was sad given the sheer excitement on many children's faces to see her. The main ride 'grizzly mountain, or mine ride' was closed for maintaince.Most rides were relatively tame in comparison to what kids can experience back home in aust. Prices very expensive esp for toys, but I guess you would expect that in Hong Kong overall.I'm gluten intolerant (coeliac) and found nothing available, so suggest you take your own food.Some great rides were space mountain and the jungle boat.Overall I guess whilst it was exciting catching the Disney train, seeing the Main Street and the ambience it provided, I felt that my money was much better spent at ocean park, which was a thoroughly enjoyable day and loads for the kids to see and do, both educationally and fun wise.",3
"If this was my first Disney experience it may have been different for me. It is much less expensive than Anaheim or Orlando but it is much smaller with far fewer attractions, many of which were closed when I was there. The gardens are lovely. I am glad I went, but probably wodon't return.",3
"It's best for 14 years old and below, not for everyone. But the rides and attractions are great, plus parade is awesome. Fireworks are so so especially if you've seen pyro olympics. As expected food and beverage are expensive. What ruined our trip, though, was the prevalence of rude tourists who have the habit of queue jumping. And in our six hour stay there I have seen a couple of fights from different tourists. Literally shouting. Very bad sight for kids. I have been hearing things like this about HK Disneyland from other people. I am not sure though if Disneyland can do something about it. Best place to visit in November to February; comfy weather.",3
Took my kids 10 & 12   definitely not as action packed as the one in LA... Probably better off if u have younger kids.  Wasdon't crowded at all so lines weredon't an issue.  If u have older kids head over to Ocean Park.,3
Have visited Disneyland Paris and i felt Hongkong Disneyland was a bit disappointing for me. The good part was the parade in the evening which was excellent.,3
We got in at 9:30 am so were able to meet mostly all the characters specially the princesses before it got crowded. The park is very small and mainly for children below 8. Space Mountain is the only ride that older kids would really enjoy along with a couple of rides in Adventureland. The Lion King show is very nice and not to be missed. Was disappointed with Mickey's golden Mickeys show as it was in Chinese and so were some others. Food available here is very average. Caramel popcorns were nice. Gives a very average Disney Experience. ,3
"I reached Disney land after 4pm so i didnt take a ride inside the park but spend time outside. Still there are lot to see around Disney.. And the entry fee for the Disney land was costly   $500 and i felt not value for me since i reached late. If you get a chance, walk to the river side and enjoy beautiful view of hongKong islands from there and the view of Disneyland resorts as well.",3
"Visited Disneyland Hong Kong last week.Missed out a number of important things such as run away mine train, lion king show and slinky ride at toy story land due to maintanence.And we notice that the roof of castle is made of some board like thingy (probably due to maintanence as well) which make the whole castle looks weird, so all our photos looks weird as well. Disappointed.",3
"We went in jan 2015 with 3 & 2year old daughters. we also stayed in disneyland hollywood hotel nd took buffet breakfast with mickey. Overall experience is like just ok not worth for money. It meight be bcos we came from singapore where we have lot more option nd process nd quality concerned. Hotel room also disneyland too small. Its more of girlish games That too for small kids. For teen kids nothing attractive.not worth for 2 days.most part is coverd with shopping dining area than kids attraction. Best part is all crew in disneyland know english nd guids friendly. Indian veg food available. ALL shows, fantacy parade nd night fireworks r good.",3
"Loved Disney land, plenty there.... The one thing I could not bare.... Was the sheer ignorance of the adults not letting the kids to the front to see the shows etc.. Also the umbrella's!! I get that they dodon't like the sun on them but my god the amount of times Me & my family almost lost an eye is a joke! Surely this could be controlled?  However putting the umbrella's aside, food was nice. My daughter loved the rides. It filled a day. ",3
"Having been to Disneyland in California and Disney World, I have possibly been a little spoilt.Hong Kong Disney was a 3 4 sized park, so it lacked some of the rides and attractions you would normally expect.It is still beautifully maintained and well presented and run. To be fair it probably caters more for younger kids 3 to 8 years, than older kids adults.The centre piece, being the Disneys Princess Castle was more painting than actual castle, so that gives you an idea of what this park is about.It is still lots of fun and I would recommend it is you are in Hong Kong looking for something to do.",3
"Go if you have not been to Japan and USA, want to experience a shot of Disneyland. There are nice souveniers to buy.But I would not want to go again for a second time.Perhaps I had too much expectation of what is called DisneyLand, but ended up rather disappointing.Firstly, the rides are not fabulous. If you wish to chill, there are not many food kiosks to choose from.Pancakes are priced quite steep. Huge foodcourt, but self service and cadon't get a seating.",3
"I think this place is suitable for children. When I was there, I have to queue about (each) 45 minutes to take photo with Minnie and Mickey. The fireworks usually starts at 9PM at the castle, but I disapointed with the castle, because the top of the castle is not real building, it is like big paint. Fortunately, the transportation to go there is well prepared.",3
"Nothing like Disneyland USA, if you are an adult. Is still good for small children, as there are plenty of kids rides and characters for them to see and do.A little disappointed at the rides aimed at adult children.. maybe 4 in total. Very dissappointed that the train around the outside of the park was closed, due to  Iron Man  being built!",3
"To put this in context   we're older customers. Not kids. But love Disney and the parks. So we wanted to try this place as we were in HK and it's only 30mins from the city.Overall, not busy at all. Visited mid week and was amazed how few people there were. Zero lines for the rides and no general sense of excitement as per the other parks in the world. Very odd. The general scale of the whole park is low and compact. Main Street seemed like a scaled back version of the original. The Castle is tiny!The Chinese visitors dodon't seem to want to try the 'aggressive rides' (Space Mountain etc) and appeared to meander around the place in awe. The rides are just the old favourites, given a slight spin or name change; the exceptions being the ToyStory Land ones...but there are no 'grown up' rides at all. We managed to do most of the rides at least 2 times and were in the park a total of 4hrs. The staff generally were lacking any sparkle and most were yawning. Least enjoyable Disney experience.",3
"when we visited disneyland i always do remember the song  it's a small world after all  played from one of the rides. firstly, it is smaller compared to disneyland, CA and very much tiny compared to Disneyworld. it was on christmas day we got to explore the place. it was a very festive day and a lot of christmas songs played and there were song and dance number presentation at night. we got to enjoy the snow foams that got showered and it was fun. the facilities were okay and the food was okay too. we diddon't go to shopping for souvenirs and part of being in disneyland brought our happy thoughts when watching disney movies and remembering it. i was disappointed with the staffs of disneyland and is that they dodon't speak english at all to tourists for every rides we get to visit. whenever they tried to explain to you or gave you a tour, they just speak chinese. not every tourist that visits disneyland HK speaks chinese. it would be proper to speak in english.",3
"Fun, but small compared to parks in Anaheim, Tokyo and, of course, massive Orlando. Getting there is a snap from the mainland.",3
"It is so much smaller than the Orlando park, and the queues are longer. It is ok but not sure we'll go back with the kids even though we live here.",3
We visited Disneyland on Christmas and boxing day (25th and 26th December).Overall the kids enjoyed the place and the stage shows are great.You are (like most theme parks) away from anywhere else so your food drink and any other supplies need to bought there or Brought with you.The Train does go there if you hotel is near the line this is the best valve and way to get there but we were staying away from the lines so we got a taxi which can take a while with long lines at the end of the night.,3
"I regret not getting the 2 day pass as one day is not enough in trying all the attractions in Disney, especially if you come on a weekend. we met a few uncouth dancers, who allowed some European guests to take a pic with her but refused us. the queues to take a picture with the Disney characters are usually jam packed.",3
"After 7y living in HK, I heard lots of critics over Disney, most of them not so exciting but decided to make my own opinion.First, tickets are quite expensive at 500hk for a day (vs Ocean Park is 345). Why not if there are many attractions and you have a full day of funSecond, actually the park indeed is rather small...north to south or east to west might take 15mins?Then most of the attractions are for kids. For adults you only have the mine train which is really nice (space mountain visual effects are quite poor and no looping) and one of these  up side down  hwad which I don t do as it just makes me sick...Also quite a lot of queuing (average being 30mns, up to 50) for short and with no surprise attractionsWe arrived at 12pm and were finished by 4pm...Won t recommend to other friends, and prefer Ocean Park where you can see they really made effort to surprise people, and are able to entertain kids and adults",3
"It is too crowded, and the waiting time is between 30 and 75 minutes on the different rides.As for most the amusement parks in the world, the food inside is terrible and very expensive. But I knew all this in advance, but for my son I wanted to visit anyway.One day is enough anyway.",3
"If you like going to Disney parks, than Disneyland Hong Kong is a place to go. It is much smaller than Orlando, and many of the American rides, such as the haunted mansion and the pirates of the Caribbean are not there, and might disappoint a few. A ride that was nice was the Mystic Manor. The lines were good, we went on Chinese New Years days no more then an hour wait per ride. the prices are Disney. The food was average for taste. All in all had an enjoyable day.",3
"As an Ex patriot living in Hong Kong for many years now I have witnessed Disney from its inception to opening to actually having kids to take there. My kids at the time of writing this are 3 and 1.3. they both love Disney and we have an Annual pass to visit at off peak times. I have actually visited over the many years all of the Disney Resorts, and unless something has changed drastically without me noticing then Disney World Orlando is unrivaled. If you have been there and come expecting anything similar then you are sure to be disappointed. The all round experience is probably still not yet as good as Ocean park, however for very young children like my own its a little more suitable. Those of you who have not visited a Disney where the first language is not English may not be aware of the system. Most staff speak the three main languages here, Cantonese, English and Mandarin Chinese. Show's like the Lion Kind are performed in English, translated by a couple of Monkeys into Cantonese then text is displayed on a display for Mainland Chinese. The Golden Mickey awards are performed in Cantonese and display boards show English and Chinese text. The Stitch experience has seperate performances for each of the three languages.As far as Rides go, there are some old favorites like Dumbo, Cinderella's carousel, Small World ride, Winnie the Pooh, Flying Saucers, along with some newer ones in places like Toy Story land. Considering the park is relatively new, the inclusion of the fairly obscure  Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse  now renamed to Tarzan's TreeHouse (I never knew Tarzan was so good at Chemistry) is something of a surprise. I also never fathomed out why the Winnie the Pooh ride is so scary for Small children, and of course older kids tend not to be into Winnie the pooh!I think you are not supposed to bring food into the park which is a fairly standard Disney rule, but we have taken food in many times and during bag search we are just told not to eat our food in the restaurants.Those of you not used to Asia may be surprised by the Culture of some of the Chinese visiting from the mainland. Hong Konger's often look down on the mainlanders as impolite and rude, and occasionally they do live up to this stereotype. In the past the mainland Chinese have tried to get photographs with westerners, but I have not witnessed that in recent years, however when my sister was visiting with Blonde children, the mainlanders could not disguise their interest in the children and often wanted to touch or Photograph them.",3
"It was my daughters first time at Disney land, and having been to Disney in Orlando and Euro Disney, HK Disney was a huge disappointment, few rides. few entertainment and rides were not exciting at all, one should rather spend their money at the Ocean park than at HK Disney. My daughter was very disappointed. Further it dies not have any other food except Chinese food. We did not want noodles and beef and pork, we wanted simple food, but there is a lack of it, there is just one bakery that had few English foods.",3
"Visited for the day during a 6 day visit to Hong Kong, to meet up with our grand daughter, who is just four years old, along with the rest of the family. Experience for her was terrific, which was the intent.This was her first time to experience Disney at any of the Disneyland resorts, so it was very much worth the visit to see her enjoy the attractions. As grand parents we have visited both Orlando and Anaheim ourselves, so we did feel that it was a bit lacking for the whole family visit.For us the experience was great, not in the resort, but in the reaction and interaction of our grand daughter",3
the Disneyland in Hong Kong is so small if you compare with the one in Japan and the United States. You could pretty much only need 3 hours to visit the whole theme park when there are not many visitors around. The facilities are relatively new comparing the other Disneyland in other countries but there are not much surprise as it is considered a very standard  Disneyland . Hotel is not too bad but not necessary since it will not take too much time to go around the whole park. food is not as great as expected!!,3
"Small park designed to look like Disneyland in Anaheim (which may sound interesting, but is actually very boring as we already have that park). Only a few rides that are  must see  especially if you are familiar with the other Disney parks   be sure to see Mystic Manor, Grizzly Mountain, and the Jungle Cruise (just to hear the spiel in Chinese). Many of the rides just felt  small  like Space Mountain and Small World, like Disney  light .Good thing is you can combine your Disneyland day with seeing other attractions that day as there is direct cab service right to from the main gate.",3
"I am a big fan of big amusement parks, perhaps that was why Hong Kong Disneyland was rather disappointing for me. Besides the beautiful shows and cute litte rides they had, I was not impressed by the lack of entertainment venues, such as thrilling rides. Which I would like to highlight, my favourite when it comes to theme parks. However, if you've never been, it is worth to bring your children out for a day of fun and bonding time. I went with my family, so I had a great time bonding with them. Although I was slightly disappointed, you cadon't say no to the magic Disneyland and her theme songs have on you.",3
"This park is well kept and clean. The rides seem to look impressive too.The crowd that seems to be attracted to this park is what has put me off. I went along with 2 small children, we were looking forward to our visit here and the dedicated train here added to the buzz. When we arrived it was early, the park haddon't opened yet so we looked around and enjoyed the atmosphere. We began to notice that we were among the minority, there were very few children there. It was all mainly adults, and not just young adults but older couples too. We thought this was great that the kids would be able to go on the rides quicker as surely all these people would not be waiting for young children's rides....we were wrong, not only were they all going on these rides but they seemed to think they had priority over the children and we were pushed out of line in a few instances and they were constantly trying to nudge through the waiting queues. Another disappointment was the fact that there were limited character meets throughout the day.",3
"Disneyland Hong Kong has been around for a while now and is frustrating slow at growing the park. The present Disneyland is regularly overcrowded and the focus on Mainland Chinese means that in providing services there is a heavy focus on staff with Mandarin. It can be frustrating communicating as frequently there is miscommunication. Disneyland is not cheap but for regular park users it is a sound investment to buy an annual pass. A tip for overseas visitors is Disneyland Hong Kong offers a significant discount for senior citizens over 65 years of age. Much like other Disneyland properties around the world on busy days (most days) there are delays in getting on rides. It makes sense to take in your own food and water (permitted) as food and drink sold inside Disneyland is not inexpensive. While Disneyland is a fun place and enjoyable when not crowded, unfortunately more often than not this is not the case.",3
Queues to long.OK for families with small children. Food and Beverage terrible. Would not go there a second time.Nothing more to say. No decent coffee.,3
"You can go around the park, ride all the rides in a day but plan it wel. Go to the farthest area first (toy story land) and ride all the rides first while there arent that many people. We rode mine train first then the new ride in the haunted mansion with the monkey then toy story land. When the chinese tourists start arriving, the queues get really long",3
"Having been to Disney World many times and Disneyland in CA, this Disney was strikingly smaller, but nonetheless enjoyable.  We took the metro there   super easy.",3
"Accompanied a friends child(10) to Disney land, hk, as no one else was available, or would could!For the child, it was fun fun fun!, For me , it was a chore! To me, something was not right, or missing. I tried to project myself into the scheme of things, but alas, no success . The little one was in his element, sounds of pure pleasure emanated involuntarily from his mouth,Great day!Having read comics etc of Disney characters, in my youth, the whole *theatre of disney* did not bring any uplift to my enthusiasm for the theme park. As stated earlier, I cannot put any rhyme nor reason to this , so just went along, accompanying him, enjoying the fact that, here is a child who is enjoying himself!Would I return, under extreme duress, but for the wee one, it would be, CAN I GO AGAIN?..",3
They had a few roller coasters...but most of the park is geared for families with younger children. The big roller coasters were space mountain and the classic miner train one.... but other than that... I dodon't remember many  thrilling  rides... for that kind of thing visit Ocean Park. they had many more coaster type rides.,3
"Being from the US, it is easy to have in your mind, how all Disneylands are supposed to be. Well, drop the bar because the HK Disney is much smaller and therefore missing the key attractions we are used to. But the biggest thing missing is the food. Dodon't come here expecting to eat US food anywhere. Even the popcorn is different   honey mustard flavored. The chocolate dipped banana is packaged in bite sized pieces. I will say the mango Dole whip was the highlight. We ate on Main Street at the Coca Cola branded restaurant and it was meh. Nothing Coca Cola at all but the location was right for the night time light parade. We had a little extra show as there was a HKer yelling at a Mainland tourist for what appeared to be a cutting in line.Kids loved the Thunder Mountain like ride because there was a twist when the ride went backwards. Loved shopping in the Main Street store. The mugs are really cute and a few of the shirts were nice. Most of the shirts are garrish; very loud and overly detailed. Yuck.The train is cute with Mickey shaped windows and handlebars. There is a display in each train which has an enclosure with a bronze like character inside.Would I go again? Nope. Check on the bucket list. We got lucky on the timing. Went on a Friday early afternoon and stayed until closing at 830. Let the crowd go ahead otherwise you are backed up on the train landing.",3
"This particular Disneyland is kid friendly. It might not be suitable for adults or teenagers who love to go on adrenaline pumping rides. Most of the attractions are less challenging. Still, it gives more than sufficient entertainment towards the whole family member.",3
This is a small park with only 2 rollercoasters for older kids.You can cover the park easily in a day.Advise that you rather save the money and go to the US Disney if you are thinking of making a special trip here.Has halal food.You can take your own food into the park.People were really polite.You can save about 10% by buying your tickets on the Kowloon Promenade. There are 2 kiosks.Easily accessible by metro.Clean toilets.Parade is really nice.,3
"Disneyland in Anaheim felt like a magical place. Everyone was so happy and smiley it really felt like a magical other world. Unfortunately, you dodon't get the Disney magic here in Hong Kong. The staff are helpful when approached but it's not in their nature to be magical.The park was small and easy for our young children to navigate. We went on a Monday and Wednesday and it was a lot quieter in the middle of the week.Lots of tourists from the mainland who, unfortunately, did lots of queue cutting and pushing and shoving. One old lady quite aggresively pushed past my 3 year old to get a seat in the 3D show, and the auditorium was only half full.",3
Disneyland did not have much to offer. P  or value for money. Ocean Park runs rings around Disneyland,3
"This Disneyland is not to the Disney standard I'm used to, having been to Paris Disneyland several times. The park is small with limited number of attractions.",3
"Before I arrived I was so exciting while looking at Disney website, I even regret why I diddon't booked disney hotel. However when i arrived i was surprised that Disneyland Hong kong is actually not very big. I like the US Main street so much, it's very beautiful, especially the Disney stores, it's really 5 star. When i see the cute stuff i felt like buying the whole store. We had a good time in Disneyland however I am quite disappointed while queuing for taking pictures with Mickey & Minnie, the queue is extremely long (1hour) and the character even had break time for 3 times during my queue. I had no idea why. The weird thing is the guy inside said  pls wait for 30 min  while actually they break for 5 min. Then I heard him saying  this queue is 1.5 hours more  why actually is not. I think he must go and learn some more English so that people wodon't be shocked to hear about  time  after long queuing. I actually get used to Universal Studio where I can find many characters in 1 street but here I only saw Mickey & Minnie, Pluto, Duffy, Alice in the afternoon and in evening I only saw Mickey, Minnie, Winnie the Pooh, Pluto and Goofy in different hut. I actually expect to see more like Donald and Daisy, Princess. Then another thing is We cannot take a pic with Elsa & Anna because we do not have the ticket that they give away in the morning. I saw 1 children was crying when Elsa & Anna said goodbye. Another advise from me is please do your shopping before the Disney paint night parade because it will be super crowded. Overall I think the entry ticket should be cheaper as inside there is not much to see.",3
"Booked a two day visit via klook.com. visited jan 2 3. jan 2 felt like the whole of hong kong went to visit the resort. long queues everywhere. average of 60 minutes queue time for rides. sometimes reaching 80 minutes! long queues for toilets too! female toilets have queues stretching as far as 20  30 meters in some parts. the golden mickey's show was such an excruciating experience. showtime was 6pm, they had as line up as early as 4:45pm and had us confined to a catwalk for more than an hour. toilet was inaccessible if you happen to be in the inner part of the queue. i had to jump over the railing to go to the toilet with my 5 year old. no such thing as priority for pregnant, persons with disabilites and families with small children (strollers). they have you line up like everyone else and a lot of people jump on queues. had an argument with some patrons more than once. some ride attendants were rude probably aggravated by language problems. one attendant in the orbitron ride was barking instructions at me and my kids and i struggled to understand. probably frustrated by me, she snapped back and said  ah bye bye!  then hurriedly left. or at least that's how she sounded.The fireworks display at 9 pm was magnificent though. better than disney anaheim as far as i remember (we were in disney anaheim back in winter 2009). but after the fireworks, people were rushing to get out and everyone seemed to be at main street. recipe for stampede! (coincidentally, the shanghai stampede accident happened around the same time). we had to stop by the side as people were pushing and shoving.went back the day after in jan 3. we queued at the gate as early as 9:15am (park gates open at 9:30 ish but park rides open at 10am) to make sure we can get a pass for the meet and greet with elsa (characters of frozen). when the gates opened, people were running towards main street to get the pass. i ran with my 8 year old and reached the main street cordon. at 10 am, the cordon was opened and we ran again toward the left side of the fantasyland castle where the passes were being handed out. i saw a mother bringing a folded stroller on one hand and her young toddler's hand on the other. the toddler stumbled and got dragged a few steps. all for just a pass for the meet and greet.we were able to get a pass and was scheduled for a 12 noon meet and greet time. we went to the spot at 11:45 and had been jumped on our queue twice! i hollered but they just ignored me. frustrating. the jan 3 visit was better. not too much people, we were able to get through most of the rides by 2pm. it's a small park after all.we booked a character dining event at the disneyland hotel. i would not recommend it. although food was good but there were only four characters present; mickey, minnie, and two bears whom i dodon't recall seeing in any of my kids' movies. the price for the buffet dinner was the same price i paid for the two day pass at the resort! i could've done away with the dinner and queued up in the meet and greet sites at the park (only the characters of frozen needed a pass).we were checked in at the novotel city gate and we took the mtr to disney. single journey ticket is hdk14 per adult one way. train change at sunny bay station and took the disney train for the resort.going back to the queueing in the toilets, my wife told me that the cubicles and overall floor area of the toilet facilities were way smaller than disney anaheim. i noticed too that there were a lot of males doing diaper changes for their kids since the queue for the men's toilets were shorter, if any.food quality was average for the burgers and chicken dishes. we frequented the tomorowland restaurant. we tried the chinese restaurant along main street and found their food likewise average but a bit pricey. souvenir prices were cheaper than their US counterparts. roving disney staff can speak english and were very accommodating. the others (especially some ride attendants) can be rude and cadon't speak and understand english.i asked my 8 year old about her preference if she ever had a chance to come back to disney, she preferred the disney at anaheim. my 6 year old can barely remember his anaheim experience so he cannot compare it with hk. my 2 year old had the time of her life during the times she was awake. overall, the kids enjoyed their time at disney hk. the feel good, happy place experience is prevalent, albeit in tighter quarters, or should i say, in smaller packages.i would recommend this park for it's proximity to other asian cities and also if it's a first time. would i be coming back? i may but not anytime soon. would i be coming back to hongkong just for disney like we did this time? nope.",3
"I've been to other Disneylands and had read reviews that this was small, however as we were in Hong Kong for 2 weeks I just had to go.It still has the great Disney magic but the park is really small and there aredon't that many rides for older people   mostly smaller childrens rides. We went on a Monday and the queues were quite reasonable. The longest we waited was 20 minutes for the jungle river cruise   wasdon't worth it as even though we went on the English boat the microphone was awful and the woman spoke so fast we coulddon't understand it!Really recommend the mystic manor   great story and wonderful gentle ride, different to other disney parks. I was most disappointed with the castle, it was really small and diddon't have anything inside to see like the other ones!Food is normal Disney fare   expensive for what it is but tastes alright.Overall, if you went in the morning you could do most of the rides by mid afternoon, but the parades especially the night one is worth waiting for.If you're a real Disney fan then go for the magic, but dodon't expect too much!",3
"Disneyland Hong Kong is a place you visit once just to say you went there. The attractions are few and the food is so so. The lines for the rides are not set up like their other parks, some are too wide and at times it turns into a mob like uncontrolled free for all. Really uncomfortable when you are in a humid environment. It's real easy to get to by MTR. I liked the special Mickey theme train they used to transfer you to the park.",3
"Visited Disneyland HK on insistence of the Missus. The whole place was swamped with tourists despite reaching there at 9.30 in the Morning. The park in itself is well designed, organised and managed. But the queue of tourists can be a bit daunting. Especially as a lot of people in HK do not like to follow the queues. Anyways the rides are good   more or less same as those in other disneylands. But the kids will still like the place. If you are a grown   up, you are better off enjoying at Ocean Park.",3
"As we had a stopover in Hong Kong we decided to visit Disneyland. Given its location it is obviously going to cater primarily for Chinese visitors. If you have been to Disneyworld in Florida, or even Disneyland in California, the Hong Kong version is very tame, but they are still adding attractions, with one large area currently under construction. While it may be tame for adults, for children who have not experienced the larger parks, it will still be magical.As I have said, it is obviously geared towards the Chinese, particularly the food outlets. There are two takeaway outlets on Main Street offering a good range of drinks, cakes and snacks, but there is only very limited seating. If it is raining, there is no undercover seating. In fact, throughout the park there is very little seating when you want a rest, other than in the restaurants, but perhaps that is intentional. Nevertheless, if you are in Hong Kong with a day to spare, particularly with children, it is worth a visit.",3
"Many many tourists from all over the world. Crowded but all themed parks are crowded.Long long queues and manageable. The park is not very huge. Very manageable. At 3pm you can watch the parade and if it rains, they will change it to a shorter parade.Shopping is nice at Disneyland. The shuttle to the hotel is quite far away.Overall, nice",3
"Yes, it's the only Disneyland in Hong Kong, so it gets to be  The Best . And it's okay for what it is, but yesterday's visit brought a big disappointment. A very light rain, and I mean a very subtle drizzle, brought on complete cancellation of the evening light parade, which was a dreadful disappointment to visitors who were making their one and only visit to this park. Come on! Black rain, typhoon, raging winds... okay, you cancel the parade. Attendance was rather light in the park yesterday and it felt like dropping the parade was a cost cutting measure rather than a weather induced necessity. Seriously, we hardly knew it was raining. Since it gets dark by about 6pm here all year, waiting until 8:20pm seems a bit late for turning on the Christmas lights and firing up the sparkle on that very tall Christmas tree. People were standing around waiting for the parade and it wasdon't long before its scheduled start that the disappointing cancellation announcement was made, so you'd think they'd liven things up by turning on the colourful lights and giving the punters, who paid dearly for this  mini  Disney experience, something to look at. But no. Staff members on sight coulddon't even tell us if the fireworks would go ahead or not,  because of the rain  (which was barely rain). I hope loads of visitors went and requested refunds, but I doubt they did. People here seem to accept whatever is thrown at them without protest or complaint. The shops on Main Street were nicely decorated, Christmas windows were lovely (albeit all displaying merchandise on sale at ridiculously high prices within), but nice to look at nonetheless. Waits at attractions were very short, never more than five minutes, as attendance was sparse. We pretty much just walked right into the Teacups, Small World, Mickey's Philharmonic 3D movie, and Space Mountain. Once there was no parade and no Christmas lights for another hour, and no doubt no snow, which was one of the main reasons we went during this Christmas period, there wasdon't much for it but to leave, so we trundled off to the MTR and headed home. If this had been our first and only visit we would have been dreadfully disappointed. As it was probably our 12th visit, we aredon't complaining too much as we've seen it all before     several times. I left feeling that park management should show a little more consideration for their customers and make sure entertainment meets expectations and doesdon't fall apart at the slightest sign of inclement weather. Makes for extremely bad word of mouth advertising     the most important kind!",3
"A trip to Hong Kong Disneyland maybe describe as the introductory visit to other Disneyland chains around the world. Being the closes to South East Asia, mostly the visitors here are from mainland China. And also maybe because its much more comfortable to them with their mother tongue is Chinese.We decided to go there on the weekdays to avoid to many people and you know what happen when there is too many mainland China in one place is you've ever been in Hong Kong. Decided to bought the ticket in one of the booth in Avenue of Stars to avoid which is much more easier rather than buying it online and have to worry about the currency exchange rates. You can reach Hong Kong Disneyland by train. Just take the Tung Chung Line and stop at Sunny Bay station and continue with the Disneyland Resort Line in a very cute train with Mickey Mouse shape windows and Disney's figurine inside the train. It's is advisable to reach there early to avoid long que at the entrance. But be informed that the entrance only open at 10am. Oh and if you going there by train (like us) do keep in mind to buy the return ticket as soon as you arrived to avoid queuing to buy your ticket back.For Muslims, there is not much of food choices for you here except for popcorns, ice cream and bottled canned drinks. So do be bring your own food to get to the whole day (if you decided to stay there the whole day). And please do keep in mind the price range for all things here in Disneyland. It could leave an empty hole in your wallet LOL. If your children is a Disney's princess or characters fans, do go to the designated area for the photo session earlier to avoid crowds. Its will be shown in the pamphlets around Disneyland.Overall, it would be best to bring your kids to Hong Kong Disneyland during Spring, Autumn or Winter. Looking at the area it would be quite traumatic for the children with the heat in Summer. And it would be nice for the Disneyland management to take into consideration to provide halal food options for other tourists.",3
The Disneyland is in a rain prone area as they even have rain parade theme instead of the regular theme This seems to be the smallest Disneyland in the world and worth a visit if you have not been to any other Disneyland parkThere are around 20 plus rides and few are always in repairs or closed cut it rainsAlthough it has a few good outdoor and pretty good indoor rides You need to have a fast pass as mostly the park is crowded Must visit if you are coming with kids but not worth if you have been to any other ones recently ,3
"Be wary of quite a number of visitors who jump queue as well being very pushy. Hold your young children securely as they risk being pushed over by anxious adults who rush into out of certain attractions. Take extra care where you place your wallets and valuables. Otherwise, enjoy this great place.",3
"I was 25 when I went here but I felt like I was taken back to my Disney Princesses days. We all are kids at heart and this is a good place to relive them. Though most rides are very kid friendly, it's still good to try them all. I like the Space Mountain ride best. The Toy Story Land rides are more of for adults. It's good to stroll around and marvel at the Disney works greatly surrounding you. Of course the highlight was the fireworks display at Sleeping Beauty's castle. It is highly accessible. Food inside are pricey. I enjoyed shopping for Disney goodies. Photo ops are schedules. I loved and enjoyed the parade and shows. Make sure to schedule your roaming around and rides in line with the schedule of the shows!Visited: November 2013",3
"Much smaller than Disneyland Anaheim,California.Fireworks display not really that good just ok.Take your camera and take lots of pictures.If you take them with disney characters like mickey pluto poo bear and all the others take as many as you can as they will also have a photograper who takes 2 or 3 and then they try to get you to buy theirs.Kinda expensive pics you buy on your way out.Ocean world is much nicer to visit.I recommend it.More rides,ect",3
"Well, as with all Disneylands, this one was crowded as well, but once you go in, the crowds begin to disperse   probably a good idea to go straight into the park rather than hover about the main street when you first arrive in the morning...Diddon't cover much but Disney is always a nice experience for children... :)",3
"if its your first time visiting a disney park, any disney will be an amazing experience for you. Me personally i have been to all disney parks in the world and find this the most disappointing. for the amount of visitors they receive in this park and the amount we pay there should be alot more attractions, shows, places to eat etc. its clean, its nice, its okay, its disney but for disney, they could do alot more with this park.",3
"Well, its got most of the same elements are its sister parks but on a smaller scale so its easier to get around. Try to go when its low season to avoid the crowds from the Mainland. The season pass is a good idea for locals with small children who cadon't handle a whole day at the park.",3
The place is not that big and usually very crowded. It's nicely decorated and of course with all equipped you need to have a fun day with your kids. There are many rides for almost all age categories. The food places are ok and clean. The prices are more on the high side.,3
It's small and filled with travelers from Mainland.  The attractions are well maintained.  Food offered there is quite expensive as expected.,3
"Today is my weekend ..Lucky my friend have free ticket to bring me and my lover to disneyland,My third go to disneyland, It is also many mainland people~~I am stay here for 4 hours and go outBecause i am not interest disneyland character and i feel bored ",3
Went on 5 12 14. Second time there. First time was 6 years back. 4d theatre still showing the same show 6 years ago.add some new activities . But Not much attracting. To me. It's Not worth of money.,3
It was easy to get to the Disneyland. We took the MTR and arrived at the park. The collection of the park tickets was easy and fast as we bought them online. We queued for more than an hour to have a pic taken with Mickey and Minnie Mouse. All the rides were family friendly. We stayed till the fireworks display and managed to complete the rides in Fantasy Land. The children had fun and enjoyed themselves very much.,3
"Having been to Disneyland Hong Kong many times (I think I have been over 12 times) and that is a bit of an achievement considering I only go to Hong Kong once a year I do feel that this time the magic wasdon't as magical. We went on a day when it was consider a quiet day for Disney. A few of the rides were close due to developments or whatever (Toy Story Parachutes and the actual train). We got there first thing in the morning and I realised prices has increased since last year by a bit. $499 for an adult. Still cheaper than other Disney parks around the world but when you consider the price was I think about $400 then that is significant. Also the food inside has gone up as well as drinks. The shows in there are out of this world and well worth the money. Do try to go to them. As for the rides, there tend to be for the younger patrons but there are a couple of bigger rides now. All the cast members do try their best for you which is good though I almost got into an argument with a family of 8 who tried to push into the queue. Still waiting for the feedback from Disney.",3
"At the outset, let me say that for children, Disneyland HK, as with any Disneyland franchise, would be such a big hit! It would be FUN and EXCITING for them!Having said that, for an adult who has been to the US Disneyland theme parks several times, HK Disneyland pales in comparison. It is a lot smaller; with just a few rides and food choices. However, that would have been ok with me. What I diddon't like is how HK Disneyland has seem to have gone too commercial. There are more stores than there are rides areas of interest. Plus all photos taken with the disney characters are for a fee! :(",3
"If you have some spare time then Disney is worth a visit, but overall I would say Ocean Park is much stronger. There is a much greater variety of things to do at Ocean Park.That said, I very much enjoyed the mine roller coaster at Disney   very fun! The Philarmagic (I think that is what it is called) was very fun too!I would say the food available is lacking and would recommend taking a few picnic sandwiches with you.",3
"Many say that this Disneyland sucks because it is so small and has no rides. While it may not have as many rides as other Disneys, there is still enough to do here to occupy a whole day. It really did feel like we were in a different world once we entered the park.Recommended attractions are Space Mountain, Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Point. Also, shoutout to the performers of the Festival of the Lion King   a few of these singers were truly fantastic.Drawback: Quite annoying how they inspect your bags purses before entrance to confiscate your water and food, so that you are forced to buy the overpriced food and beverages inside the park.Tip: If possible, go on a weekday   all the lineups were under 5 minutes, even for the popular rides. Weekends are a different story.",3
I have to both eurodisney and orlando  Felt like it was time wasted here  I highly recommend oceanpark in hong kong rather  That was really amazing  Worth visitkng again,3
This is our first time visiting the    ghost house    in Disneyland during Halloween. We bought the night ticket and entered Disneyland at 7p.m. We waited for around half an hour to visit each ghost house. The ghost house is not very terrifying; suitable for elder children    it took around 10 15 minutes to walk through the ghost house. The night parade is exactly like its television advertisement. The children were excited but it is not that attractive to adults. Firework at the castle was amazing; it starts at 21:00 every night. The music and firework cooperate to create a wonderful memory for visitors.,3
"My initial impression of HK Disneyland wasdon't great. When we got there, we were inundated with overly loud and tacky music. We then had to queue up in 3 different places.Once inside, the loud music continued and as far as the eye could see was overpriced merchandise and queues to get photos with characters.We then continued to the themed areas and went firstly to  Adventureland . This was perhaps a mistake, because quite frankly it was rather boring.After that, however, it got much better. All of the other areas were much more entertaining and I started to get into it. That was until lunch time. Upon viewing the menu, I actually looked around to see if there were hidden cameras. The prices were more than double what you would pay in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is one of the most expensive cities on Earth.Nevertheless, we had lunch and then proceeded with a much lighter wallet for the rest of the day. By the time we got to dinner (because we HAD to stay for the fireworks) I just handed them my wallet and told them to take whatever they wanted.Actually, to be a little more fair, getting back to the merchandise, it wasdon't that overpriced. I just diddon't like the fact you were inundated with it as soon as you entered the park.The bathrooms are plentiful and pretty clean, which must be quite an undertaking.The rides are on the junior side, but there are a few to entertain the adults.Overall I did enjoyed the day with kids. I'll just have retire a few months later, to pay for the meals.",3
"If you have been to other Disneyland Parks in other countries, you would be disappointed with the size and the attractions in HK Disneyland. Its a lot smaller than other Disneyland Parks (Paris, Orland, Tokyo are the ones I've seen) and the rides are quite few. We went on a Tuesday where foot traffic was quite low and got there at 10am. We rode all of the rides and visited all attractions and managed to finish everything by 5pm. Note that this includes 10 30mins wait for each ride. The parade was scheduled at 7:30pm then fireworks follows at 8pm. We diddon't wait for both. We just wanted to go home since there's nothing else to see. Just to add, it also has the smallest sleeping beauty's castle that looked more like a prop that a real castle. On another note, my nieces who were Disneyland first timers loved the experience. I guess HK Disneyland works for kids and for Disney first timers.",3
"I have been to Tokyo Disneyland, the experience with HK is only about 15% close.Disneyland suppose to be the happiness place on the planet, the one in HK does not really make you feel that way, I guess is the service quality they provide.@ goqlue.com",3
"It's Disneyland! A happy place to be. Rides are not very exciting. Universal Studio was much more fun. Everything in there is super expensive. Food could cost USD30 40 for a simple set meal of rice, chicken and cola. Doesdon't even taste nice. Should stick with fried snacks and hotdogs.",3
"Disneyland Hong Kong is a great facility. It has everything a Disneyland should have and kids love it. But,..... if you visit it during a weekend it is a nightmare, simply too many people.",3
"It was the 3rd time I went to Hong Kong and visitted this attraction. Apart from its well known brand name, cannot compare to Disney World in the US or Legoland in Europe. Avoid weekends as the crowds and long tiring queues will kill you and your kids very soon. Should buy online tickets before you get here. Get an Octopus card or you will have to queue at the ticket vending machine for return tickets. Or else, should buy return tickets from the station's ticket service counter upon departure to save time. Try to avoid the heat in summer time from Jun to Oct or you will soon dry out and get tired before your kids do. Bring a baby trolley or hire one for yr toddlers or smalller kids right after entrance. Do not visit the shops first as you will go back the same way out, unless you want some burdens to carry along the visit. Stay till late for the fireworks as ot worths seeing. Disneyland should build more trees or shadows and put more benches for family to relax nearby the food courts. Should give discount for early birds. Queueing was a nightmare, but it happens in all famous attractions. Should have 2 lines for adult and kids, and kids must be given higher priority. Should invest more on attractions, as I've been here last year and tjis year almost see no change nor additional attractions.",3
"This Disney Land is mainly for young children. There is no adventure land of tomorrow land. If you have been to Anaheim , Orlando or Tokyo, you will disappointed by this Disneyland. It is full of very young children and mainland Chinese families, often in large groups. If you have never been to one of the other Disneylands , you will able to enjoy it for what it is. If you have older or teenage children who are expecting adventure rides like space mountain or the run away train, then you will have to put up with their winging all day.",3
"The place was great ! It has lots of attractions and rides ! But the queue ing for those attractions can be a pain, especially for little children, which causes a lot of waste of time, hence, it is not enough to explore every places here !",3
Went there to spend all day but after many hours we rallies that it's not what we expect .. it's a great magical land for kids they will live there dreams there but l dodon't recommend it for adults !!,3
"honestly... i diddon't like it much. I have been to disney land in orlando and does not compare even 50% to it. the parade was not as thrilling as the one in America. I did not enjoy it much but for disney park first timers, they might enjoy it.",3
"Ok, I know, it is Disneyland and it is meant to be sweet. And it was my idea to go   the three of us 62 year olds in our second childhood mode.But by the end of the day it was just saccharine overload and I was glad to get out. Getting there is easy, even though it is far from the centre of Hong Kong   take the train, cheap and simple, fast and efficient. And you can book tickets online and redeem them at a separate section at the gate.At first it is all lovely   and it *is* very clean and well done. But I am afraid after a while I found it cloying, the rides for the most part uninspiring and, at times, tacky (and our  guide  on the jungle river cruise was loud and unintelligible   Irrawaddy Irma might as well have spoken in Burmese for all we could hear), and the total overload of trinket and souvenir sales outlets, from the vast emporium right at the gate to little stalls and carts everywhere else, just left the impression the place was out to drain you of every dollar you had on you, or in your card.Food outlets were mostly fast food type and poor quality. We ate at the River View, one of the few sit down restaurants, and it was adequate but not great.Is it good for kids? Yes, and if you have kids and are in Hong Kong you simply must take them. Am I glad I went, yes, but rather so I know not to go again unless I am with people that *do* have kids to take along. Maybe I am not just the right temperament.If I was a child I'd rate it excellent, no doubt, but as a 60  adult, it was just ok and I would not race back, sorry.",3
One of the Disneyland staff in the Main St. Store reprimanded my son when he was playing with the velvet ropes while my wife was lining up to pay for all the Disney merchandise that we got from the same shop. My son was 5. The staff probably realized his mistake and gave my kid a free sticker. But still. ,3
"We are a family of 5 and we went to disneyland this year and it was alright, it was mostly for children. The best thing was the mountain rollercoaster and the 9pm fireworks. The weather was hot and there was too much people. The prices of the food were like 98 hongkong dollars, which was quite expensive, it was nasty and dry. I would not reccomend eating the food.",3
"We went to HK Disneyland on the weekend when we would expect really high crowds, but the crowd level was manageable. We arrived there at 1 PM after having lunch in Tsim Sha Sui.At 3 PM, a typhoon warning was issued, it's potentially a storm coming right towards Hong Kong Disneyland, most of outdoor attractions are suddenly closed. We managed to stay there because the weather situation was bright and good enough. 1 hour after, they reopened all rides again and visitors could continue having fun! Woohoo!Some good things we experienced:1. 3 times riding Big Grizzly Mountain due to very short queue line (only 5 mins standing in line to enjoy every ride)2. Incredible fireworks to end our dayLastly, this would be an objective review. If you are a true Disney fan and have been to other Disney parks, please be open minded and realize that you are going to HK Disneyland to have fun and experience the magic of Disney in new place country. This theme park might not be as good big interesting as others, so you gotta visit other Disneyland to experience ultimate treasures and rides!HK Trip period: 18 Sept   22 Sept 2014",3
"We went to Disney land as part of a tour. We were excited and just a little bit nervous when our hotel pick up was to be 10am. What is we missed out?? As it happened even though we got to the park at about 11.30 we were to have until 9:15 pm there. That was definitely long enough. Many of the rides were targeted at younger children, but the grizzly grinch was worth a couple of turns. Ironically the queues at the couple of scarier rides were short, and things like the bumper cars had very long queues. We did enjoy our time there, but think younger children would benefit more. Our daughter is 11 and probably at the outer edge of enjoying the thrill of cartoon characters. Also note that you aredon't meant to take food, and there is a real culture of  buy this, buy that ",3
"This park is tiny compared of course to Disney World. It is actually small compared to Disneyland in California. Whenever my friends come to see it they always talk about how small the castle seems. But, even though it is small it packs in some good attractions and good shows. Mystic Manor ride is pretty cool. Space mountain always is a thrill. Grizzly gulch has a fun roller coaster. And adventureland has some fun attractions. I havedon't seen the new night parade yet, but I hear that it is one of the best things in the park now. You might want to check it out. ",3
"I've been to Disneyland for only a few times when I was just a kid, but I could clearly remember what makes memories into dreams. when people say that Disneyland was the place where dreams come true, they were not kidding when dreams happen. most of the attractions were very thrilling to ride especially the space mountain where you feel the thrills of air going to your face. The buzz lightyear astro blaster was maybe the best ride all around in disneyland, its was funand amazing to be palying with your friends and family as you blast your way and seeing who was the better shooter. but all the while being in Hong Kong disneyland is almost the same as to the one in the united states.But disneyland is really a fun place to be with where memories are made to lst forever.",3
over all Disney Land was basically very poor if you were looking for an adventure park experience... DL is catering for the very young.. So overall not a good experience it you are above 10 years old ... A very big let down,3
The weather was unbelievably hot and the price of drinks were just like tomorrowland... ... out of this world   horrendous queuing system and you definitely need a two day pass just to go on the rides   all very disappointing after having to hang around an hour to get in   not everything was a let down though the MTR to the park is fun and full of Disney memorabilia   but its cheap to get in and only 30 mins on the MTR from Central.,3
"The disneyland is a must go for tourist because it is disneyland. Other than that, there are really not much to do there. Spend approximately 5 hours there would be sufficient, do not need to stay there longer than that.The unique part of going there is the MTR train which is designed with a Micky Mouse theme.",3
"It's Disneyland, it's happy and it's definitely fun. There's not a lot to say about this aside from that it's solid family oriented entertainment. It is however, very small compared to the US offerings as the entire park can be easily canvased in half a day which makes this an expensive attraction for the entrance fee.If you've never been to Disneyland then you'll love it here but if you've been to the US parks, this is just as expensive and far, far smaller.",3
"The weather was very hot so you dodon't see alot of characters walking around. Only chance is at the timeslots where they will appear. Service staff looks tired and lethargic as well. A lot of food stalls were closed as well, guess most people will wanna go into the air con restaurants to avoid the heat.Enjoyed the photo taking opportunities. The fireworks was good at 8pm. But the ground we sat on was hot from the Sun all day.",3
"Been here 2 weeks ago with my daughter and its ok for a 1 time thing. It was hot exhausting but the performance was brilliant, i must say that the characters in area where always on a rush to leave their post. Ie having a picture with them is very difficult as when your about to que up, they suddenly say, no more pictures. Yet its 10mins before their suppose to finish, no considerations what so ever. Even you ask politely to the staff who are incharge of the que. What a waste if the management wont chang this kind of attitude of the staffs. Sad ",3
"If you have visited Disney Florida this will disappoint.   It is a great place for young children, not not much for olderchildren  young adults.  We only spent a couple of hours there and we had seen it all!",3
"The park is very nicely laid out and decorated well. currently lots of development happening.The rides are not aimed at anyone looking for a thrill. they are all very tame and child like. the best part was the 4d cinema experience 'mickey's philla magic'.The MTR disney train and station is very elaborate and dedicated for Disney.Children will love it ,but it is a lot smaller than the USA versions.",3
My daughter was disappointed due to its size as we had just come from Singapore (Universal Studios theme park) so it was unfortunate. Still it was a day out and it was good to visit a Disneyland theme park.,3
"Liked: No queues! Surprisingly   perhaps it was the season, the weather or we were just fortunate. Hardly any queues (maximum 10 mins for Jungle Cruise); Small World had no queues such that we took it twice back to back.Also liked it because it was small enough to cover in a few hours, with a little toddler in tow.Disliked: Too warm (no fault of Disneyland), too many Mainland tourists even though it wasdon't crowded (sorry!)",3
Magical world for kids.  The best part is the fireworks at the castles.  But it is too small. Half day is more than enough for this place.,3
"Hong Kong Disneyland was the purpose of our trip. It was Magical with all the Disney charming, but a bit disappointed as the place and especially, the Castle, was super small. We missed some shows as they were no English show by the time we arrived, and we diddon't wanna wait until the evening. However, they have the new lands like Toy Story land, which has many fun rides for teenagers.",3
"We went to Disneyland HK in our last vacation (2 days after a Nightmare day At Ocean Park   also reviewed)..Despite of this one is much smaller than other Disney Parks, it's nice and have good attractions.. My kids enjoyed the space Mountain (they ride it 3 times: normal queu, fast past and single riders..) .. Also, the Toy Story section was nice.. as well as the Hunted House. .The Lion King show was really great... What are the negative thing:The rude, disrespectful, unpolite mainland Chinese visitors... !!!Those guys dodon't know to respect others, they always try to cut the queue.. push you.... and are so uneducated.!! zero manners...!! That was the negative part of the day.. but.. being a smaller verison of a Disney park.. it was good... Disney Staff: Increase your staff for managing those  tourists ...",3
"We are a Disney Family and our son currently works at Disney World. We planned two days at the park as that is the normal time it takes to enjoy everything at both Disneyland and Disney World. We went to the park on a Tuesday and Thursday while in Hong Kong. Here is the bad parts:Park was very small, easily navigated it in a half day. Not as many rides as either US parks. US narrative on the jungle cruise was free lance and no script. Should have done the Chinese line. Now for the good:Mystic Manor was very well done.Jungle Cruise offered in 3 languages (not sure they knew the script in English)Toy Story land was very cute. Small World had a few items like Disney characters in each themed area. Grizzly Gulch was fun. Mine Train had a great unexpected twist to the ride. Best Space Mountain of the three Disney parks we have.visited. Firworks were AWESOME. EASY access to the park using the MTR and Disneyland Express.",3
"I was excited to go here since it opened several years back. Anyway, I went here after lunch. Had lunch then waited for the parade. The parade was great but I cadon't see the view clearly because everyone is with umbrella. The queues were not so long even on a Saturday so I diddon't bother to buy a special pass. The area is quite big so I was not able to see all the attractions. So if you plan to visit, make sure that you spend the whole day in Disneyland. The staff are Chinese speaking and cadon't understand English. They are not smiling too. The experience was not so pleasant because I'm a smiling person and I cadon't get a smile back. This is not the Disneyland I have imagined. I have thought of accommodating and caring crew but this is way different. They are talking to each other and do not bother to even look at me when I asked question. This is really a terrible experience for me. The fireworks is the only thing that made my visit magical. I had goosebumps when I saw the fireworks and went home with a smile. So I'm giving a rating of Good for the fireworks alone. ",3
"As said on the title, it is not worth going to the Hong Kong Dinseyland if you had been to another Disneyland. This one is just too small. The same stuff with even smaller scale. The most disturbing thing is that the queue is outrageous for the main rides. And the recently opened area's ride had broke down multiple times.Still if you are first time being at Dinseyland, then you may enjoy it. There is some exclusive for this park like the Toy Story Land, the Iron Man thingy(which is not open yet)etc.Getting there is easy as well, just get to any MTR station and buy a ticket and you will be there in no time. Where Your Nightmares Come True.  is my ultimate comment for this park.",3
Maybe its because the park is too small as compared to its american cousins or maybe its the proximity to the worlds most densely populated regions but it was a nightmare navigating through the unusually large volume of people and this was on a weekday and when we had reached the park before it opened. Food is terrible and a rip off.,3
"I really wanted to love this place but it was just okay. My husband and I surprised our 6 year old daughter with a visit on a trip to Hong Kong before traveling on to China to adopt her little sister. It was a very pretty park and we loved the Toy Story land, so cool! Some staff members were exceptionally friendly some would not crack a smile for anything, very hit or miss. The workers at the food carts were all consistantly friendly and helpful. We visited on a Thursday and it was so crowded that it really made it impossible to enjoy the day. Our daughter loved the surprise and was so excited to be there but was honestly ready to leave pretty quickly because the lines were just so long and it took so long to do anything. Lines were not well organized and there were not a lot of fast pass options. It was super hot which we expected but with the crowds and lack of shade in a lot of areas it made it a long exhausting day. We had hoped to stay for fireworks but gave up at 5:00 and returned to our hotel to swim. We had thought we might return later or possibly a different day but honestly none of us wanted to. The gift shops were even so crowded on main street that it took us almost 15 minutes to get back out through the crowd after fighting our way in! I refused to buy anything because I woulddon't stand in the line wrapped around the building to pay. We probably would have had a completely different experience on a less crowded day. ",3
Disney Hong kong was well below my expectations. Very long queues   which go up to some 1 2 hours waiting time!!  Very hard for kids!!   Toilet facilities are very limited in the park  with long queues again!!,3
A nice place to visit with kids but as a grown up there's not that much to do... It was smaller than I expected and food & beverage needs a lot of improvement...,3
Quite the same as any Disneyland bur smaller and more crowded.  There was a long queue for every game and I spent most of the time waiting.,3
We just went to Hong Kong Disney and the Main Street was under Major Construction. At least half of the buildings were just a printed face instead of the real buildings. I guess they are renovating already. Also the rides lines were very long. This means to me they need to add more attractions or more things to do in between the rides. Good for them bad for us.,3
"Last year I visited Disney in Orlando and we went to Hong Kong as my new partner had never been to Disney and I wanted to introduce him, unfortunately it is a very watered down version, like Paris. I did expect this but not so much there is maybe 1 or 2 rides for adults, all the rest are for little kids and families. But still a very good, fun day!",3
"Its a good place to go for your first visit to a disneyland park. Few of the rides and adventures are not disney high level standards. Avoid going in summers as its very hot. Water  cold drinks are priced 3 times in the disneyland. Long Q awaits you. Anything between 45 75 mins are each of the major attraction. People coming from mainland china to visit disneyland are quite rude, loud and have no sense of standing in queue. No characters walking around the park to meet children. you really have to go to one place to meet them and click pictures. For that also you need to stand in a Q. This place is nothing compared to US disney.But if you or your kids havent visited disneyland . Then go.",3
"Hmmm where to start, ok so we are English speakers visiting from our home in Malaysia (first time visit) I knew it was not quite right when my 4 year old said to me  mummy why are Mickey and Minnie speaking in a different language  they were speaking in Chinese as were all the other characters in the Golden Mickey show. Had we known we would not have queued and been squashed like crazy in a terrible area squashed together by a whole load of anxious and impatient visitors.....it was truly terrifying especially for my 4 year old. It probably did not help that it was pouring rain the whole day so people were trying to get in out of the rain. Perhaps there should be a huge sign stating that these shows are in Chinese so that non Chinese do not waste their time. Next, I cannot believe that we spent two days at Hongkong Disney and did not see any of the characters walking around the park and shaking hands and hugging the kids, this was a complete shock. This is something you see all the time at Disney Florida, this does not happen here in HK Disney. However, you can queue up for hours for a photo with some of the characters, there is a list of which character will be where and at what time. This is Disney, the kids are supposed to see the characters and not just at a photo shoot opportunity. It felt like a fairground and that's about all, with a very nice firework display at the end. We saw more of the characters at the Disney Hollywood hotel than we did at HK Disney. There are plenty of gift shops for the kids to buy there favourite character gifts and of course they are expensive but this is a given, it's Disney. The food was very good and the service from restaurant workers was very good. We've visited and had the experience, would not return and would not recommend it.",3
"I dodon't mean to point fingers to any group of tourists, but majority that's visited the park, you know who I am talking about. It's one thing everyone wants to do... it's go out on a beautiful day with your friends & family and relax and spend a good time at a magical place, Disneyland. All is well until you walk through the gates and notice there's tons of people in the park. Whatever rides you want to go on, there's lines of people. Of course, we expect it. Like most people, we all waited in line. Anyway, here's my complaint.... a lot of  NON LOCAL  residents group, called  THE TOURISTS . They get in line to try to get to the front. They will breathe down your neck and bumps behind you every step you wait in line. Then they have their  UNTAMED  kids push your legs or step on your toes, etc. The worst I'd seen, is they use their kids to push you forward while you are standing in line. This is getting ridiculous. Almost every line I waited on, I have these  TOURISTS  messing with my group of family and friends. Come on, we are all in line, what's the rush to push and pressure people on a line that isdon't moving. It's like one attraction after another, they walk run over anyone that's in their way. I have to admit, park is a lot better if  The Tourists  behave appropriately and learn to respect others by giving them their own space and not just bump, step or walk run over them!",3
Looked forward to visiting Hong Kong Disneyland and I was fully aware that it was much smaller than the Anaheim Disneyland. It was quite disappointing and some of the attractions did not measure up to Disney's high standards. I understand Hong Kong is a different country however when you're in a tourist location it would be great if some of the staff could actually communicate in English as this was a British Colony for over 100 years. If you have never been to Disneyland and want a small taste of the Disney experience then this is ok but give it a big miss if you have been to the original as you will be extremely disappointed. The staff in the Disney emporium were quite friendly and helpful however in some of the cafes they may need to learn a thing or two about customer service and realise not everyone can speak Cantonese. Ok place to visit but woulddon't waste my time again,3
"Disneyland is a magical place when everyone is respectful of queues, personal space and general politeness. We visited Hong Kong Disneyland in October 2012 and the 2 days were awesome. We have brought our kids back as they have been asking for near on 2 years they loved it so much, but this time in August it has been a very different experience. The weather has been a challenge with rain causing major disruptions to park operations. Lightning can also shut down all outdoor rides for 1 2 hours. The crowds were huge and as many others have said the mainland china visitors can make the day very frustrating. They push and shove their way through queues and when you pull them up on it they get upset. I found it exhausting trying to stop my kids from being trampled and got sick of arguing with people trying to push past us. Disney does make announcements about line skipping but they do need to make more of an effort to be a presence during these high peak visitor times. I think this Disneyland is great for younger kids. My 3yo went on everything that she wanted too and my 8 yo was also well entertained. Tips: get there first thing and plan your first 1.5 hours to do your most wanted rides as after that you will wait at least 45 mins for everything you try to do. If fast passes are operating for any rides get in early as they switch them off when it all gets too busy. If you are wanting to buy souvenirs dodon't wait until the end of the park day to do so as you will battle every other visitor at this time. If you are staying for fireworks be prepared that you may have a very long wait for the train if that is your mode of transport. I still think Hong Kong Disneyland is great but will never return during this time of the year again.",3
"As per what the title states.. Compared to the other Disney parks (I have been to the Cali and Florida ones numerous times), this Hong Kong location is very small.It does have some good rides.. both classic and new different ones. But my experience was completely ruined by the mass amounts of mainland china tourists who are not only rude, poor mannered but are constantly finding ways to cut the queue. It has been a nuisance being around them all day to the point where my family and I decided to leave early. Disney should really step up their staff and security in ensuring ALL guests have a good experience. I have visited once a few years back, once again this year.. But based on my my most recent experience.. It's better off saving your money and go to any of the other disneys instead.",3
"If you have already visited the other Disney parks especially the Orlando one, this might not be worth you penny and your while.As noted by some fellow reviewers, expect to be elbowed and jostled about and to have a couple of umbrellas tossed in your face by other visitors. We can assure you that his was not the same experience we had in Orlando.Some staff may appear to be rude partly because they are not comfortable enough with English.Tips:1. If you are visiting with small children, the variety of amusement may suffice but it may not be up to the mark for young teenagers.2. One of the metro (MTR) stations is just right in front of the gate, thus, making for easy access to and from several major locations in Hongkong.3. Do not miss the fireworks!",3
"Good time, but be careful of Nut Allergy. Signs are posted that say they will work with your allergy, however, when we tried to order pizza they told us there were no nuts in it, but when we saw it had pesto on it knew for certain had nuts. We spoke with the whole staff (including the chef) in a particular area and they said it did not have nuts, but the staff in an adjacent area (with the same product) said the item most certainly had nuts. The item was pesto and had pine nuts in it. Fortunately, we knew it did and did not consume it, but for those that dodon't know it can mean life and death. Very disappointing, especially because they were so adamant that it did not have any nuts. I did speak to a manager in Guest Services, but I dodon't know how far that went. Just be aware. Other than that, it was a good time.",3
"Too many people and long waiting lines, however you can book in advance by using Fast Pass.Food quality need to improve with more choices.Provide moe shaded area while waiting on lines. Direction signage is not clear.The train is not in service which was disappointed.Not enough shaded area for people to rest and sit, as a result, people are sitting on sidewalk.Cheers,Max",3
"It was my childhood dream to visit a Disneyland Park. So I was very excited to visit the park along with my wife and two sons. However I was a bit disappointed with the overall experience.Maybe I had high expectations from this big international brand! Also since we had earlier visited the Universal Studios in Singapore we were expecting a similar or better experience.However, the Disney park was extremely crowded when we visited on a weekday. Every ride had a minimum of 50 minute wait time with long serpentine queues. Hence we could only experience 5 6 rides. Some of the visitors from Mainland China were extremely in disciplined and line cutting was a common site everywhere. These people travel in large numbers with only one person waiting in the queue and then a dozen others joining that one person as he reaches near the ride. Disneyland claims that it will not allow outside food but to our surprise we found many of the visitors enjoying outside and home cooked food. We enjoyed the Disney Parade and the Lion King Show. Also the firework display which starts at 8 pm is very good. Some tips  It is advisable to buy your disney tickets in advance from either the Disney Hotels (if you are staying in one) or from the Disney outlet on the Avenue of Stars at Tsim Sha Tsui. This way you will save a precious 1 hour wait time at the ticket counter in the Park. Besides on every ticket you will get a small gift (bag tags, etc) at the Disney store on the Avenue of Stars.  While visiting the park with toddlers, its best to carry your own pram as renting one at the park costs HK$100.  If you are staying at the Disney Hotels then do not waste your time in shopping for Disney merchandise at the Park as there is a Disney store with the entire range of merchandise located in these Disney Hotels.  Plan to watch the Lion King show when you are tired walking around or if its raining. As the show is held indoors  Do NOT waste your time queuing up for the Autopedia ride. Its not worth it!  Try to be near the castle (the main roundabout) by around 3.15 pm as the Disney Parade starts by 3.30 pm",3
"Please do not come on July to Disneyland HK, It is very hot and crowded. Many countries are having holiday during this time, very long queue and truly very hot.",3
I cadon't say anything but FUN. The outside area is a huge park that lets guests visitors take their pictures with Mickey surfin' in the middle.,3
"Visited Disney on a recent trip to HK (western couple, frequent travelers). It was really crowded and there was not a lot of shade. We did have fun on some of the familiar rides (space mountain, grizzly gulch) and enjoyed the overall experience. It was really nice to be able to take the metro right to the entrance. Most of our frustration came from being constantly hit in the face by the sun umbrellas of the other patrons and the fact that the concept of standing in line and waiting your turn seems to be foreign to the Chinese. Prepare yourself for that and you will enjoy. Would also have loved to see some of the characters roaming around for photos. ",3
"Was expwcting better. I am a fan of Disneyland and often go to Disneyland Paris. This one is very small, I diddon't feel the same enjoyment as in Paris. Wodon't make it again in here, but will continue going to Disneyland Paris.",3
"I have an experience with many disneyland but this time, Hong Kong Disneyland did not meet my expectation. The park crew is not smile, warm welcome and always busy. Actually I love to learn service behavior from disneyland crew, so this time, they show the quality of service was down. Personally, I think Everland Korea is better than HK disneyland",3
"Most of the rides were shut down for around 2 hours due to the threat of lightening, which made it very boring and very little to do. Size quite small and not as fun as Tokyo",3
"This place is to small to called disneyland,compare to japan and florida...the attraction and the ride to little,they dodon't even have 4D yet.",3
"Be very careful to check if there is a typhoon warning 3 or above as they will close all outdoor rides. Even the ones undercover like teacups, carousel etc. The day we went there was no sign outside nor did the ticket office warn us that since there was a warning of a typhoon this would happen. There was light showers and little to no wind and long moments of blue skies but that did not mean they woulddon't close the rides. We were baffled. The actual typhoon hit around 8pm but they closed the rides 6 hrs earlier than that. With modern technology there is no need for that. Anyone with a smart phone can see the front coming in. This closure meant that every single ride in toy story land was closed. Every single one. The one ride in glitter gulch was closed as well. The river rafts, tarzans tree house closed. Autopia, UFO ride, dumbo closed. The staff really are not efficient and I saw one smile all day. The line for the lion king show is like a football riot. They have a large area that funnels into a smaller area. The pushing and shoving is pretty ridiculous. Just be near the front. Someone said this is cheap. Yes it is by disneyland standards. But it's very small. We rode 5 different rides and we were there from 11 9pm. Also do not eat close to 9pm. They pretty much stop cooking at about 7:30pm. Our burgers and fries were stone cold and my wife and daughters food was also. We had fun but make sure you do your research. It's tough to find out whether a typhoon is coming using the internet so try and find a reliable weather source before you head out.",3
"I visited Hongkong Disneyland several weeks ago, but since my kids are below 4 years, I thought it's not worth to get in. So, we planned to visit but not buying tickets for entrance.Ok, we arrived at the station that connected with train to the park. Well, the train tickets costs quite a lot, around 28 HKD maybe I do not really remember. How we love to be in that train which all about Mickey, the window shape, the hand holder, and there are Disney's characters statue too on every corner of the compartment. We started to feel so Disney. We reached the station, still felt so Disney because within several steps we easily reached the welcome gate with Mickey statue on it.... Strolling along the way, and we reached a big fountain with whale and again Mickey on it, still excited and felt so Disney, until my eyes reached the sight of crowds, which was the mass of people queueing at the ticket gate... Our Disney feeling dropped drastically!  Is that all?  we asked each other... Come on, dodon't wish for Mickey and friends to get out, we cannot even see the castle or anything. And almost no food stalls around outside the ticket gate. That was real just it!If I knew it before, I woulddon't go out of the train station to save my Octopus balance...",3
"I made my way here by train which is easily sign posted. You will have to switch trains at Sunny Bank station but the Disneyland train is right across the platform. If you have been to any of the Anaheim, Paris or Tokyo Disney parks, this one is very similar but on a smaller scale. I went on a particularly hot day so have lots of water and a fan. Be prepared for long waits in lines: for rides, for food, for restrooms, for water (you get the idea). Also, heaps of people trying to push in which is particularly annoying on a hot day and you have someone trying to push past you. Just stand your ground   I tried to play nice and be courteous but by the end of the day I was stopping small children in their path to pushing in front of me. There are only two rides that have fast pass (which was a little disappointing). Word to the wise: if the ride has solo riders, line up there. The line for solo riders was only 1 3   1 2 the wait time of the other line. I felt a little let down because I have been to be other parks but it would still be great for first timers or families. The staff were still great, the magic is still there and it is still Disneyland but just be aware and you can still have a great time :)",3
"The parade and fireworks are worth while to see.The facilities here are not attractive, cute or fun as Disneyland California, only a few duplicated facilities as California one. I guess that's reason why.Most of the food meals restaurants of amusement parks are expensive and distasteful. The food and meals of restaurants in Disneyland HK are delicious, that surprised me.If you wanna visiting Disneyland in an economy way, and do not hate hot humid weather, I'd recommend you to visit here.",3
"This place was like mini Disney when compared to DisneyWorld in Florida. Cinderella's castle was about 1 3 the size. The entire park was about 1 4 the size. Less rides, etc. Good news was that the tickets were a lot less as well. I think they were $50 55 compared to $100 in the US. If you've never been to a Disney park, you'll like it. If you are from Florida (ahem) and have been to DisneyWorld, especially more than once, skip it because you'll be disappointed.",3
Small but cute. It's not a must see for Americans unless you want to collect Hong Kong Disney souvenirs. I really enjoyed the Lion King and Mystic Manir attractions. The contestant line jumping of mail and China visitors was VERY IRRITATING! The sit down fried rice meal I ordered w  oyster sauce was slimy : (. If you want discounts really go through every store. I came across shirts marked 50 70% off and 10% off gift shop items before noon (early bird rate).,3
Start the day early and wait till 8'pm for the fireworks display..  Liked the lion king drama and the 3 D movie,3
"It may look the same on a smaller scale, but I found that it just diddon't have the same atmosphere. We were there with our 6 year old grandson and he enjoyed it nether the less, one consolation is the queues for rides are not as long and therefore the wait time is considerably less, in my opinion it's not worth buying a fast pass.I think the restaurants could be a little better and offer a wider variety of food, personally I was looking for something a little more healthy and ended up with a burger.The train around the park was not running when we were there which was a disappointment however it is due to renovations and could not be helped.The highlight for me was to be the fireworks and due to the weather it was cancelled at the last minute, obviously they are not in control of the weather but it would be nice if we were issued a special pass to enter just for the fireworks on another night without having to purchase another one day pass.",3
"Our whole family went to this place at the end of June 2014. Primary goal of our vacation to Hong Kong is playing in this park. We went by MTR from Jordan Kowloon heading to disneyland. Disney themed MTR is very interesting and full of families with young children. We had not buy a ticket online so had to queue up first. The queue was not too long, only 10 people, but spend 20 minutes to wait. We had a great time playing and watching a variety of shows here. There is one game that needs special attention is Space Mountain. It was not made clear that this is a Roller Coaster, and since the location is inside a building it looks like a normal train game, so many are not vigilant. If you are indeed ready, healthy and strong please try. In the queuing time, there is a special entrance for those who are not able to continue. There were souvenir shops everywhere. Sell       goods at a price that needs serious consideration, the price is relatively expensive. There are restaurants everywhere, providing Disneyland themed menu. Performances of Disney Characters Parade starts around 14:30. Should come to the Main Street location a bit early in order to get a good position. The game ended in a fireworks show with background Casle Sleeping Beauty (if not mistaken). After completion of the entire event at Disneyland, no need to rush, many vehicles available, especially the Disney MTR available each less than 5 minutes. Enjoyable experience but not going here twice...",3
This disney is not as big as one in Japan.  They charge a fortune for individual bags in the cloak room.  Not as good as in Japan.,3
We visited Disneyland over two days. Although nowhere as big as Disneyland Anaheim USA you have no intention of going on all the rides I would suggest one full day would be enough. Transport to the Island is in abundance wether you are staying on Hong Kong Island or Kowloon.,3
"Was a good experience, we have been to Disney in many countries but none top Florida. Dodon't get me wrong for young kids it would be fab especially if not been to any, was worth going",3
"The Disneyland is very small compare to L.A., It is less clean compare to Tokyo Disneyland. Full of people (locals and tourists). Many of the tourists from China (Mandarin speaking people), they dodon't have sense of personal space and dodon't have correct concept of queue or line.Beside the rudeness of the tourists, everything was fine. My kids enjoyed most of the rides as they are the same as in US and Japan. If you had visited other Disneyland or Disney world, I dodon't recommend this. There are a lot of interesting place you can go visit in HK. We went to Kam Shan Country Park and encounter with many monkeys and wild boar.If you must go, please visit during weekdays to avoid large crowd.",3
"Hong Kong Disneyland is easily accessible by MTR. It has a station of its own, and you can change lines at Sunny Bay Station to go there directly. I recommend going there during Easter as Chinese nationals have no Easter holidays and thus it should not be as crowded. Visiting on weekdays will definitely help. Food there is average. It doesdon't taste spectacular but is more than acceptable. Food is a bit more expensive but alright for a theme park and cheaper than other theme parks in the world. There can be pretty long lines for games and toilets; thus visit on weekdays or go in early. The staff is helpful but then again when the theme park is stuffed there is little they can do. Remember to visit Mystic Manor as it is unique to HK Disneyland.   Fast tickets  are available for Buzz Lightyear and Winnie the Pooh rides. Generally alright.",3
Thinking it was going to be like usa disneyland...very wrong. not a lot there. Still nice outing for the day.,3
"Disneyland Hong Kong is very much aimed at younger people. Whereas Disneyland in LA has things for everyone to do, there are serious limitations on things to do if you are over 12 years old.The park is rather small and there are only a few rides which would be suitable for teens or older. Overall given that it is far less expensive than US Disneyland parks it is okay if you just want to be able to say I have been to Disneyland Hong Kong. If you have been to the other parks though you might want to give it a miss.",3

"I was a little bit disappointed with Hong Kong Disneyland. It diddon't have a lot of exciting attractions and the park was quite small compared to the other Disneyland (LA) I've been to. The park was definitely lacking some thrilling rides. It was possible to do the whole park in 3 4 hours.I think children would feel more satisfied with HK Disneyland, because although the park has little interesting attractions it still has the Disneyland felling once you are inside.I dodon't really regret having gone to Hong Kong Disneyland, because it was ok after all and really easy to reach by MTR. I am not, however, going back there again, it would be a waste of time and money. Also, unless you have spare time in HK, you might prefere to go to some other attraction instead of HK Disneyland.Just for the record: Disneyland in Los Angeles is MUCH better.",3
"Comparing to Disneyland LA, it is very much different. It's mostly kiddy rides but it is always a happy feeling when visiting any Disneyland. This time I could go on some rides more often as it diddon't seem to get much crowded. Same shops as the US, so you can get good souvenirs too. Very convenient transport as well with the MTR.",3
"If you've been to other Disneyland's around the world, this really does not compare at all. It is a small park and I diddon't really get a  Disney vibe  walking around (when I went there really wasdon't a lot of Disney music playing no characters walking around.) If you're staying in HK, I would advise a trip to Ocean Park (which is a lot bigger, has more attractions than this Disneyland and it slightly cheaper than Disney.)If you're at this Disneyland, I would suggest getting express tickets for some rides an hour or so prior so you can avoid the long queues in the heat to get to them.",3
There is nothing for older kids and teens. Only few rides are worth experiencing.  It is a small world  was closed for technical reasons on the day of our visit.  Philher's Magic 3D show was enjoyable. The property is very small compared to US Disney Land and not worth visiting if you have already visited US Disney.,3
The park is good for a daytrip with your kids.....although it is lacking unique items when compared to peers.... few items needs special mention such as Tinkerbell fairy.... The model posing as Tinkerbell is extraordinary. The joyride in the stream with wild encounters is good. The gardens are nicely cured giving lots of greenery.Overall.. a good experience.,3
"Is it really worth a special visit? I visited the park 4 times, when it first opened, and an average of every 2 years after that and I admit that there has always been a magical, indescribably Disney speckle, but Hong Kong Disneyland is not that special when compared with the other Disney parks. Space mountain is always a hit, Toy Story land is cute, and Main Street USA is always quaint, but I find it very problematic how Disney did not exploit its chances with incorporating Hong Kong's flare into its characters attractions. It is quite cute when Minnie Mouse dresses up in traditional qipao and also a nice surprise when the space cafe serves cha siu burgers but these feel so obvious...Tourists and happy little kids are everywhere, they make you feel like a big kid at heart but, you are better off going to Ocean Park where there are more attractions and specifically, ones that are more specific to local culture, natural site and history. Disneyland is quintessentially American, and if you want that authenticity, go to the Disney parks in Florida. Pastiche ofSelection of American parks mashed into small and pricey real estate Admit that I am coming",3
"too small to be a   real disneyland, some good rides, but a lot missing from the US parks,food too expensive, but very clean. train was not working. and the main street USA was very small with a lot of buildings in card board",3

"Easyly reached by MTR, Disneyland HK also famous as one of the place you should visit in HK. I did and sadly to say I'm not so impressed. Disneyland is a guaranteed place to have fun for kids. But, this place cadon't satisfied every single family member.",3
"The real thing   Disney .. but pales in comparison to the LA or the Orlando Disneyworld. True that it is one of the few attractions which HK has to offer for children. Rides are okay and it can get crowded as is smaller when compared to other Disney parks. Easy access   and the kids will enjoy it, no matter what.",3
"This Disney park is small compared with Disney parks over the world. Not much choice of games.  Suggest to add Florida 4D Toy Story game, and digital games of Epcot.",3
"We had to take a 3 year old grandson   which means of course you dodon't have a choice! Getting there   this is Hong Kong, mind you   was quite okay. However, the walk from the Disney Train Stop already is a hassle (lack of shade, directions). Once you get to the proper ticket counter (online orders only), you still have to cue up. Inside you get okay directions, but picking just your choice attractions is not easy, as you will have to pass by all those you diddon't pick. Compare it to a supermarket or IKEA with their force you to buy layout. Now, once you do reach your pick, you still need to cue   not easy with little kids, and the quick channel, which you have to pay on top. You get hungry too, of course, and you're not allowed to bring stuff in! Apart from the high prices for any of the outlets, please dodon't expect quality or even appetizing food   you simply dodon't have a choice. What I just cadon't understand: they offer annual tickets and they even sell them! For me: once is more than enough. For my grandson: you get to see all those cartoon figures, rides, and stuff from the movies, which seems to be worth all the hassle. Congratulations to Disney for a truly rip off concept that even works!",3
"Disneyland Hong Kong pales in terms of size and variety when compared to other Disneyland parks in the rest of the world.Best to go during the weekday especially midweek where the crowd is less. Check the weather ahead before booking a ticket as some rides may be shut during heavy rain. In summer remember to bring hats and sun block.Those who are budget conscious should bring their own container of water   drink as there are water points for you to fill. The price of soft drinks are price like 6 star hotel and hence be warned. In addition bring some snacks too.Plan your day trip well so as to maximum your time at the park as each adventure or ride is some distance from each other. Include in your plan should cater for the afternoon parade and the evening fireworks.On the whole, if it is not crowded as in jam packed, it can be a relaxing day trip for the family.",3
"Everything in Hong Kong seems tiny. HK Disney was quite disappointing (for someone who has been to Florida Disney World). Firstly it is very small. I could not even fit inside some of the roller coasters. Many of the performances were in Chinese so not very friendly to foreigners (a few were in english). You can visit and do every attraction in a few hours (less than half a day). There is virtually no camera people (disney photo) to be found, except at the character spots. This disappointment was balanced by the amazing Toy Story land. A must do!",3
"I have been to most Disneyland (Anaheim, Tokyo, Paris and Disney Sea) so when I got to Hong Kong Disneyland I was slightly disappointed with the size of the Disneyland. Although on my second visit things have improved a lot I still wish they will expand the area and add more rides. Nonetheless it is super clean and super safe. Staffs are very helpful and the rides are friendly to all ages. They even have different train serving the Disneyland route. Located about 40 minutes by train from Kowloon and Hong Kong. My suggestion is that you come in early so by mid day you will finish all the rides and you can enjoy the rest of your day back to the city. If you wish to stay behind for the parade or firework you should ask the ticketing officer first. Sometimes during winter period they wodon't have a closing parade.",3
"I enjoyed Tokyo Disney Sea and Tokyo Disneyland much more than in Hong Kong. The food in the Flavours of the Orient restaurant however, was outstanding and the best I've had in any theme park ever!The rides were enjoyable and as it was a Tuesday, there was not a large crowd. All in all, it was nice and there were the usual Disney things to see and do, however it was just a little bland.",3
"Disneyland will always be Disneyland   every child's dream. When my family and cousins decided to come to Hong Kong, Disney was in the top list. The tickets are categorized into adults, children and senior citizens and price ranges from HKD 450 to HKD 100. It is very easy to go there by MTR. Get off at Sunny Bay Station and transfer to the Disney Train. The train is cool because it is themed. You see Mickey's logo in all windows and many characters all over. The fun has begun. When we reached the gate, we were told to throw away our snacks. This one really made us all feel bad. We had two kids with us and they were very excited to shop for their snacks the day before. We just wished there was a locker where could have kept their snacks and bring it back home. The goodies were thrown all to the garbage. Anyway, after the gate incident, we were all transformed in another world. Pictures here and there, shopping for souvenirs and having all the rides. We spent the whole day there until the fireworks at 8PM. My parents were senior citizens so they cadon't walk and have fun as us but there were many places for them to rest so diddon't worry much. Oh, the Mickey Pancake is very expensive but there really nothing much there for taste. So be ready to spent a lot of money for food inside the park. Yeah, they let you throw your food so you can buy their food inside. The area is really small especially if you have been to other Disney resorts like Tokyo Disneyland. But it was a nice feeling to see Goofy and Merlin walking by and saying Hi to everyone. I hope the kids had a wonderful time.",3
"If your kids are below 10 then they will love it here, lots of rides and the usual Disney layout with lots of overpriced shopping everywhere, generally a good day as long as it's sunny and the fireworks last thing is worth waiting for but...More",3
We had a nice day at Disneyland but it really is geared toward young children.  With the rides we had to queue for long times to be disappointing by most of them. The highlight was the Lion Kong Show which was very entertaining.,3

"We went in July 2013. The weather is insanely hot, humid and too many people. When the parade came cant get good pictures because people are pushing and holding their umbrella, so cant get clear photos, some people are just so rude! And queuing in a hot weather.. we were dripping with sweats!! yikes! its a wrong month to go!! Themepark are standard, the US are still the best, but my daughter love the rides and it was her first visit to Disneyland, Mystic Manor its a must to see because it was different than the Haunted house, Toy story land is awesome! at the end we dont regret anything, but too come back..no way!",3
"Disney is definitely great if you have kids but if you are traveling as a family with adult children, Universal Studios is a lot better (as it has more exciting rides).  It was nice though to see the Disney Characters parading :)",3

"We visited here in March and was very disappointing in the park. We have been to other disneylands so this may of spoilt us. The disney castle is only 1 4 the size, there is no where as much merchandise to purchase or to choose from. I'm into scrapbooking and coulddon't even get an album, t shirts for children only had iron on transfers, men's t shirts were not available in the larger sizes. No where near the amount of rides and just does not have the buzz. Food availability is limited on any western foods. I was taking my grand children here but have decided against it and will go to LA instead.",3
"If you have been to the real deal (in the USA) then Hong Kong Disney will be disappointing unless you except that it is a much smaller version. Its very easy to get to HK Disney by Train and the crowds are no where like the USA version, in fact, the longest you wait for any ride is only about 20 minutes!. The park itself is catering towards the younger children, with only two scary rides (Space Moutin and Grissly grouch). The grounds are lovely and very clean and the disney parade is worth seeing.The costs are not great, so if you have some free days in Hong Kong, and some small children, then its worth the visit .",3
"For the price of the ticket we expect a bit more warm and friendly welcome from the park esp the employees. I understand generally people in HK move fast lane but that is not an excuse to be such dry and to some extend snobbish with us the guests. Be more helpful and precise in giving directions and help us understand the park guide even though they are not in charge at customer service section.Weather was almost completely wet thoughout the season and we would expect the park to be more proactive in arranging schedule for parade and fireworks such as early information. Delay and cancellation of fireworks were stressful for children who could have left in happiness to watch it. The least we expect is to give info for us to be prepared with season like now or give little discount as people travel across the world for this, end up fireworks cancel. Yesterday it delayed almost 45 minutes and informed only after 20 minutes pass the schedule time, it cause huge distress to most young children.",3
"Catch the train to Disney   as with all public transport in Hong Kong   the MTR is incredibly efficient & cheap. It costs about $4AU to get there. We agree with past reviews, Disney HK is very small and there are more shops than rides and attractions. Luckily we had a short wait time for most rides   the best one being Grizzly Gulch runaway mine cars. We saw all of the park and had finished within about 3.5 hours.Worth seeing, but woulddon't go again.",3
"Easy access by subway, it seems a small Magic Kingdom, so not good for teenagers. Disney standards of quality are preserved. Be prepared to long lines all days of the week.",3
Very expensive ..    Food tasteless  Burger was about $20 US and was worth about $3!!!  Bring your own food,3
"Small rides, without too much imagination or thrill factor. The Disney characters are hard to find when walking around, in fact no characters were walking around the crowds like we have seen elsewhere.  Easy to get to using the MTR",3
"It is an average type of themepark, more for younger kids, there are some extreme rides for young adults too, but I find the attaction too pricey. Nothing much inside , my kids AS HALF DISAPPOINTED HALF SATISFIED, somehow bored and asked to leave earlier.  But...More",3
"It's OK. We've visited on a wednesday, it was crowed. The place it's small for the amount of people, and the rides are few. If you have visited Disneyland or Disney World, you'll probably get disappointed.",3
"But not good for teenagers. It was a mistake going there. We thought it would have exhilarating rides but obviously teenagers weredon't the target market here. Kids would definitely love it here, with the castle and Toy Story. But the park was rather small and we finished exploring the whole area, but obviously this is from a teenager's standpoint.",3
We've been to the Paris' & Tokyo and honestly it's really small as compared to those we've been. Good thing is that the q were really short and we were able to play ALL the rides in a day!,3
"First of all, I must say that when we visited it was cold and drizzling, so that might affect the review a little. We took the special Disney themed MTR ( Magical Train Ride ? They really should have taken advantage of this acronym) to the park. We arrived at the Western styled train station which was, of course, very Disney, but also gave us the impression of a slightly  cheap knock off  effect...Ticket for entry was HK$450 for an adult, which is very similar to a ticket price for Alton Towers in the UK, but in terms for bang for your buck, this place was lacking. Disney is still very popular in Hong Kong and China, so obviously a theme park here would do great business, but having been to theme parks before, my wife and I had certain expectations. My wife especially so, since she has been to the Disneyland in Florida. The trademarked Disney castle was shamefully small. The rides were not incredibly thrilling. That is not to say they weredon't fun, but their warning to tell riders to remove their glasses for Space Mountain, were very overcautious. I just ended up feeling quite sick for not having my glasses on as I could not see the ride. The best rides were the Runaway Mine Cars and Mystic Manor, but since there are only 6 or so rides there, there aredon't many to choose from. We managed to spend 4 hours in the theme park, but we left with a mostly dissatisfied view of the place. The place obviously had to cater more to the locals and so, the place concentrated on shows, souvenir shops, and eateries, which were not our thing. At least, I can say, we have visited it now, but I think if you want a true Disney experience, then this is not the Disneyland to visit.",3
"The kids love it..but the older kids (mommy & I) have experienced Anaheim knows the magical feeling of entering Disneyland and there were none on a really cold day.Getting there was a breeze via the MTR and the crowd was relatively thin on a Wednesday. We were considering staying at the resorts, but our friends told us that it all can be done within a day.Stop off at Main Street corner cafe for brunch and to get away from the cold. Bad food and uninterested wait staff :(Tomorrowland has the best rides and we managed the get pictures with Buzz Lightyear and Stitch. In fact the characters here are more accessible than in US. Definitely there are like 2 sets of each characters.Our 4 and 1 year old were so excited to see all of them especially Mickey! The camera crew were very nice and so were the ride attendants.Fantasyland would be good for very young children with the Small Small World & Winnie the Pooh rides.Toy Story Land has also good rides and displays.The other areas were not really themed after any Disney franchises, so diddon't add much excitement to our kids.Flight of Fantasy Parade at 330pm was Ok. But the fireworks show at 730pm was quite spectacular.Interestingly it was easy to take the MTR back as most visitors are from tour groups on coaches or staying at the resorts.Merchandise pricing were not too high and I could see how affluent the mainland Chinese were with their spendings.Overall... a starter Disneyland for kids. Definitely a watered down version. Now I fully understand why they say Ocean Park is better.",3
"We diddon't have to queue for many of the rides, but it was raining all day and 8 degrees. My children have lived long enough in England, that I dodon't think it put them off too much. It's like a spring day in England. My children (7 year old girl and 9 year old boy) are not the biggest of the thrill seekers, so only the car ride and the Winnie Pooh ride did they really enjoy. Frankly most of them felt like fair ground attractions with a lick of disney paint. I woulddon't have been too happy to queue for hours to ride a carousel or some of the other smaller rides. Maybe we've been spoilt, but it certainly isdon't a patch on Legoland in Windsor (UK) for younger children. That said, the shows that we saw were fantastic and I would give these priority over the rides, because they are truly of standard you see in the theatre and are full of colour! The food is about twice the price you would pay in the city and was of canteen quality. They do search bags, but I believe that is purely as a security measure. They diddon't take our water off us or the packs of sweets we were carrying. Also, I would question if there's any value in staying in the Disney hotel, it's miles away from the train station and the theme park itself. In fact it was less walking to get to the MTR and walk to our hotel. (About 40 minutes and our hotel is Kowloon) Also you dodon't have to be hotel guests to have dinner or breakfast there.We did not stay for the fireworks, so I cadon't review them. However it feels like a good way to scam you into eating dinner at the park....",3
"Food is not worth for your money. We diddon't enjoy much of the rides due to long queue and some people DO NOT know how to fall in line, while some staff tolerate the behavior. Highlight of that evening was the fireworks display. It was awesome and we were happy that we stayed and waited for it.",3
"It's so much smaller than any of the other Disneylands and they hardly have any characters. If you can go to any other Disneyland, give this one a miss. Better to go to Ocean Park on the south side go Hong Kong Island.",3
"May be I have been to Disneyland in Japan & U.S.A, so, I dodon't think Hong Kong disneyland is too much attractive for me. The size is quite small. Also, so many many people here made me to queue up for a long time for everything. It was really not a joyful experience. Suggest all visitors avoid any public holiday to come here.. May be you can get a more peaceful and happy moment.",3
"During the visit, the place was over crowded making impossible to enjoy anything. For everything was needed to wait in line around one hour or even more. Even for MTR tickets was necessary to wait around 20 minutes. The place is great to visit, but avoid as much as possible official holidays.",3
"It was my second time coming here; came with my family back in August 2008, then with my wife and 18 month old daughter during the recent Chinese New Year (CNY) on the 31st January 2014.Compared to last time, there are now 2 or 3 more parks have been added into the park (Toy Story, Grizzly Bear something, and Mystic Point...I think). Hence the increase in ticket price from 5 years ago (it was HKD350 adult, now it's HKD450 adult). The only one that I'd commend would be the new roller coaster in the Grizzly Park. It was unique and awesome despite having zero 360 turns. The others (which are also new) like the Dropping Down thingy and the U shaped roller coaster were boring even from far away. Diddon't even bother to queue for them. As a teenager cum lover of extreme rides, I diddon't like it very much back then, and I still dodon't like it now. Kept comparing it to Ocean Park, which was full with extreme rides. But as a family man, I enjoyed it a lot. The entrance staffs even allowed us to bring some of our own foods and mineral water. Maybe because I'm with an infant. But I did try one of the two Halal restaurants. We bought the Briyani set and the Chicken Rice set. They were plentiful, tasty, and did not disappoint. Of course it was expensive   already expected that.Not focusing on the rides, we spent the day enjoying the exhibitions and the magical shows   The Lion King show was awesome, the others were pretty much similar like 5 years ago. Quite plain and boring. We also spent time browsing all the stores and taking pictures   definitely a lot of updated and new products. For products with Disneyland on them, they can be considered affordable because of their quality, in my opinion. Bought a Stitch T shirt in 2008, it still looks like new now even after having wore it for hundreds of times. Even the baby room was excellent, although there was only one for the entire park!CONS:The sea of people clearly disrupted some of those moments, especially when I found out that Chinese people here actually dodon't really have common courtesy and public manners   even towards elderly people and families with strollers like me. They'd simply shoulder elbow you without thinking and saying sorry. I think if it's easy to throw their knees around, they'd use them too. If I know about this, I woulddon't have come during CNY. I was actually expecting more...specialized, cultural events or shows because it's the CNY. Just wanted to value or enjoy how Mainland Chinese people celebrate it, compared to Malaysian Chinese. But to no avail. I got to tell you, Malaysian Chinese are definitely better than Mainland's.Will I come here again? Nope! Even during normal days...Luckily I did not waste my money to buy the two day passes, I was so close to buying them.  D",3
"So, it was my first time going to Disney, and I was getting all hyped up, and so looking forward to the experience.The travelling part was a little taxing but not difficult as the MTR line and Disney resort line are all linked together. Also, entering the place wasdon't a hectic despite the heavy crowd as everything was very well organised.The food and stuff there were quite affordable, to my surprise, and I bought a number of souvenirs there. Only downside is that it's nowhere near the city or town, it's isolated, so you definitely have to eat there. The food here is still OK.Coming to the rides and all that, it's kind of cool and all that. However, be prepared to be faced with screaming kids and rude tourists who will just cut the queue or not making way for you to pass. Also, some of the more popular rides required quite a long wait   eg the car ride. Everything is beautiful here and well maintained here. I'm not sure if it's myself, but I was a little disappointed. Although there are sufficient rides and attractions, however, I felt that it could have been expanded more to cater to the large crowd and avid photographer like myself. All in all, it was quite a enjoyable experience, but I felt that more improvement could be made.",3
The smallest Disneyland and a disappointment compared with others in LA and Orlando. It is also very crowded with tourists from the Chinese Mainland.,3
"Went on a friday evening, and its already super crowded, cadon't imagine whats going to be like on Saturdays and Sundays. Queues for taking photos with the Disney Characters are even longer than the rides themselves. So be prepared to spend more than half of your time there waiting and queing. I've spent the whole day there and only manage to take just 4 rides.Plenty of rides and attraction, but mainly designed for kids. Adults probably would not enjoy much. Overall, pales in comparison with Ocean Park. And this would probably my 1st and last time visiting.",3
"Feels more like a shopping mall with rides inside it. The staff are friendly and there are lot of small things to buy for great memories. However, if you've been to any other disney lands you'll be really disappointed. The castle is just so small it's like a fort. You can walk around the place in an hour. There are 2 shows that you should circle in if you do go there. The golden mickey's and the festival of the lion king. However, if you've seen the broadway lion king you will be really underwhelmed by the performance. The show in LA is also much better. Cost 450 hong kong dollars to get in if you buy the tickets at the entrance. The tickets are cheaper if you get them from the airport when you are flying in from wherever you are coming from. If you've never been to a disneyland then go, if you've been to other ones it's not worth the price of admission.",3
Visited this park when on holiday in Hong Kong. It was much smaller than the  cousins  in Florida and Paris.I would not recommend if you have limited time in the city. It comprises 1 Park which can be done in 03 hours off peak.The quality of the rides and entertainment is on the same level as the other Disney Parks.,3
"Very mixed feelings about our recent visit to Disneyland Hong Kong. Firstly we stayed at the Hollywood Hotel which wasdon't anything extraordinary! I think I had very high expectations for our stay there   after all its Disneyland!Not sure if it was because of the crazy Christmas time of year that we went, but the lines were way tooo long, over 60 minute waits which 5 children under 6 are not going to cope with :( I must say however that 2 day passes were very affordable, and even merchandise was quite cheap considering. I was mostly disappointed with the fact that we travelled all this way and diddon't get one photo with any of the characters. The wait lines were full of older people (40  !!!) Seriously, where is the fun for the kids if every line is full of adults! The kids were very sad by this :( The only thing that was magical was the beautiful evening show of lights and fireworks and the  snow  that fell in USA Street. Apart from that Disneyland really wasdon't that great. I hope when I visit another Disneyland in the future I have a better, happier, magical Disney experience",3
"A very small Disneyland but you still get caught up in the magic. Not many rides and attaractions yet, and expensive admission.",3
"Disneyland is a great day out if you have never been there before, especially if you have children under the age of 5. But once your kids start approaching double figures you will find they get bored very quickly. Nothing to do for teenagers or adults. If you have older children do yourself a favour and take them to Ocean Park instead. Oh, and did I mention the food is inedible.",3
"To children whose first Disney adventure is HK Disneyland, a visit to the much  talked Asian Disney fantasy would be a treat to remember.   Maybe because my kids ( grown ups now) and l have been to the ones in LA and Paris, HK Disney...More",3
"Guess it makes it harder to review Disney HK when you have visited Disney World Florida. I found  HK Disney lame and without presence, compared to the Mother Parks in Florida. Its however worth the visit and can be done in a day. The MTR...More",3
Hong Kong Disney is fairly small and I would say you can do everything in 1 day or less.  We arrived at 09H30 to avoid the crowds and so did not have to wait too long at the rides.  By  2pm we had done most...More,3
"I was excited upon knowing the HK Disneyland added new rides and attraction and planned a 2nd visit. So darn regret that the timing was not rosy. First off, dodon't get me wrong. The new rides ESP Grizzly glutch's is worth your time. However, the crowd was just overwhelming. Then, comes the rude queue cutters! No prizes for guessing where they're from.. Tsk. They totally spoilt the Disney exp with their pushing, loud jarring voices, spitting... Oh god! Probably bc of the crowd load, I diddon't see ANY smile on ANY of the Disney rangers... A cardinal sin for theme parks. My first visit was in the early dec way eons ago and it was a total different exp. I You should take that as ref to plan for ur nxt visit. ",3
This disneyland is perhaps the smallest one in Dinsy Park family and doesdon't match up to the high standards and expereince of other Disney Parks around the world. The park is quite small and can be covered in 3 hours flat. Not many interesting rides or theaters. Even the park merchandise is sub par. I would not recommend this park,3
If you've ever been to Disneyland anywhere you'll find Disneyland Hong Kong very similar in the layout when you walk into main street! It has a very familiar feel. One of the rides  its a Small World  is absolutely fabulous and worth doing. The day we visited was fairly hot and relatively busy but the queues moved fairly well. ,4
"Its been a while since d last time we visit HK Disneyland .. Yet, this time we only stay in Tomorrowland .. AKA Marvel land!Now they have Iron Man Experience n d Newly open Ant Man n d Wasp!!Ironman .. Great feature n so Exciting, especially d whole scenery of HK (HK central area to Kowloon)!Antman .. Changed by previous Buzz lightyear! More or less d same, but I'm expecting to have something most!!However, my boys like it!!Space Mountain .. Turns into Star Wars!! This 1 is Great!!!For cast members (staffs) .. Felt bit MINUS point from before!!! Just dun feel like its a Disney brand!! Seems more local like Ocean Park or even worst!!They got no SMILING face, but just wanna u to enter n attraction n leave!!Hello this is supposed to be Happiest Place on Earth brand!! But, just really Dont feel it!!Bakery in Main Street now have more attractive delicacies n Disney theme sweets .. These are Good Points!!Last, they also have Starbucks now inside the theme park!!",4
"Thanks God it wasn   t too hot or too humid when I was visiting the park   otherwise it would be a big issue (there is not a lot of shade).I have arrived around 10:30am and left at 6pm. Unfortunately I didn   t last until evening parade, but 8.5 hours was too much for me.There is plenty to do and everyone will find something interesting for themselves to enjoy.It wasn   t extremely busy and the longest time I had to queue for certain attractions was 45 minutes (which is really not that bad).Although I had an amazing time, I felt a bit underwhelmed with choice of rides and attractions. The park itself is quite small (I was really expecting something grand   even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small).The food options are good, few coffee shops (including Starbucks) and plenty of gift shops. There was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere.All together it was a great day out and I really enjoyed it.",4
"HK Disneyland is a great compact park. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of maintenance work going on at present so a number of areas are closed off (including the famous castle) If you go midweek, it is not too crowded and certainly no where near as bus as LA Disneyland. We did notice on this visit that prices for food, drinks etc have really gone through the roof so be prepared to pay top dollar for snacks (and avoid the souvenir shops if you can) Regardless, kids will love it.",4
"the location is not in the city, took around 1 hour from Kowlon, my kids like disneyland so much, everything is fine.   but its really crowded and hot in Hong Kong",4
"We spend two days, the second day went early then went straight to the back of the park, no lineups for so children got to go on many rides, some twice in a row. This Disneyland is very suitable for young children ours were 7,6,5,4,3 and 1 so most of them could go on all the rides, it was disappointing the castle was closed no nightly fireworks. Would not like to go in the hot season.",4
"Its huge , not enough to visit in one day. We did with 2 days pass ... all the scenes were amazing ... you were like in movies, fairytales, etc. At 8 pm, we have enjoyed lots with the character show on the street. Must Visit !!! ",4
It   s Disneyland! It just does not need reviewing!  Place speaks for itself.  However smaller than I expected.  Great experience,4
"A great day out even for adults.We can early and we're able to do almost all rides in a couple of hours. The restaurants were great and a good selection of different foods. Try the caramel popcorn! Unfortunately, when we went the bars and 1 restaurant was closed, but still other options available.The rides are mostly for little kids bit a couple were good for adults. The shopping was the highlight of the day with huge selection of Disney gifts and clothing. Note if there is a daily special get it early as it will sell out. There is not a lot of shade so bring hats and an umbrella.",4
"We have been to Disneyland in LA two times, and Tokyo Disneyland Disney Sea. Walking through the gates at HK Disneyland felt like going back to LA. This is because the park is owned by Disney and HK Government. We loved the quietness of HK Disneyland in the morning, most things in HK dodon't open until 10am, so to walk in with very few people in front of us was great. Toy Storyland doesdon't open until 11am. We purchased our tickets online from Australia and printed them before we left. You are sent an email with a link to an electronic version with QR codes and personalised characters, but we used the printed version much easier and the website can be a little slow. We also purchased the Dining Vouchers as well, this entitled us to Lunch or Dinner a popcorn or a iceblock. If you are there for two days, like we were then just double the number of vouchers you purchase. HK Disneyland uses the old style Fast pass system, scan your ticket and get a printed fastpass. We were staying at Disney Explorers Lodge and received fast passes to certain rides from there as well. The food in HK Disneyland is aimed at the Asian Market, although there are restaurants who serve burgers etc. If you have fussy eaters then beware you may have limited choices, but over all the food was Disney quality. We ate at the Starliner Restaurant at Tomorrowland.We loved Space Mountain with the Star Wars overlay, sooo coool. The is no Pirates of the Caribbean ride, sad, but the Lion King show and Mickey's PhilharMagic shows are great fun.Unique to the HK Disneyland is Mystic Manor, an amazing trackless ride so fun we went on it three times, the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars is great fun, the experience varies depending on where you are sitting, we had front row, amazing, and last row, still fun but a little rough. Also unique to HK Disneyland is the Iron Man Experience, a ride simulator on a Stark Industries flyer through Hong Kong. Lots of fun.When you ride the Jungle Cruise remember to choose the English line or Cantonese line as the skippers script is done in both. They say there is no difference in the line waiting time, we diddon't really notice it.Yes HKL Disneyland is smaller than LA Disneyland  Tokyo Disneyland but two days allows you to see pretty much everything and not a break net speed. We are a Disney loving family and our girls were aged 17, 15, and 10 when we attended the park. The Christmas decorations and the parade were great.HK Disneyland is on the MTR line just change at Sunny Bay Station for the Disneyland line. You can use your Octopus Card to travel on the MTR. There are shuttle buses that run from the Disney Hotels to the transport hub at Disneyland and you can walk if you want to along the bay from the hotels. It would be roughly 20 minutes walk from the Disneyland Hotel along the bay. There is also a ferry that runs from Central to HK Disneyland but the MTR train is the best option in my opinion, especially as it has Mickey Shaped Windows and Disney theming inside the train carriages.",4
Australian family of four with 2 kids (12 and 9) enjoyed a full day out at Hong Kong Disneyland with plenty to do and see.If you have been to other Disney's and get a chance to visit Hong Kong   I say definitely do it. There are a couple of unique Hong Kong experiences including two Marvel attractions   Antman and Ironman   both which we enjoyed.For thrill seekers there are a couple of great rides   The Big Grizzly Mountain was probably our favourite   it was unexpected and fast. And the RC Racer in Toystoryland definitely worth the wait.For families with younger kids there is heaps here to do   we kind of skipped fantasyland   but for young families you would probably spend a lot of the day here.The park is easy to get to as well   the dedicated Disney train line was fun to ride on   and with an easily navigable MTR in Hong Kong it was simple and cheap to get to the Park.,4
"If your are travelling to Disney land from mong cok you can purchase your tickets from one of the travel shops at a discounted rate (we purchased ours from Hong Thai travel) this is in the bank centre on Nathan road, right next to the Mong Kok station.   if you go to level 4 there are numerous travel shops (including CTS) which from other reviews that I read is where most people purchased the tickets. We asked around the shops on level 4 for the price of their Disneyland ticket (including CTS) and we found Hong Thai travel the cheapest. The tickets were $557HKD each for adults. I would recommend asking around each shop for their price on the day. They seem to all open at 10am. The sales advisor will hand you a letter which you then take to the box office at Disney land and swap for entry tickets   it was very easy and we had no problems. Hong Thai travel Bank centre Nathan roadAs the park opened at 10.30am we decided to get a taxi on the way there, this costs roughly $200HKD from Mong Kok and takes around 20 minutes.On the way back we used the trains, the route is:Disney land to Sunny Bay (pink line)Sunny Bay to Lai King Station (orange line)Lai King Station to Mong Kok (red line)The trains costs are around $20HKD and takes roughly 1 hour.  if you want to catch the train to Disneyland from Mong Kok the route is;Mong Kok to Lai King Station (red line)Lai King Station to Sunny Bay Station (orange line)Sunny Bay Station to Disneyland (pink line)",4
"Hong Kong is easy to get to via the MTR from Kowloon, great signage and fast. Our day started well but just after arriving it started to rain quite heavily and diddon't stop until mid afternoon. Characters were out in the main street but only saw two during the day, probably due to the rain. Even though the crowds on entry were big once inside it diddon't seem crowded at all, Toy Story Land was a ghost town with no one going on the rides in the rain. We enjoy the rides that were open and all in all had a good day. Had heard great things about Mystic Manor but found it just okay, loved Hyperspace Mountain, Ant Man and Ironman. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars were my favorite of the day! Though shopping wasdon't as good as Disneyland in the USA which was disappointing, catering mainly to children. Happy to have visited but dodon't think I'd go to Hong Kong again.",4
"It's always going to be fun at Disneyland. These are a few of my reminders: dodon't bring selfie sticks and huge tripods you can bring bottled water or if you have a reusable container, use that instead food can be expensive so eat plenty before going here. Just dodon't ride the rollercoasters right away. dodon't miss the Festival of the Lion King Show. You can forget the Moana production though if you're expecting the songs from the movie and to see Maui wear comfortable shoes. there will be lots of walking have fun and dodon't get discouraged by long queues. you'll have your turn sooner than you think.",4
"To be honest it rained nearly all day, if the weather was better i'm sure my overall impression would have been much better. It lacks the thrill seeking rides of other disney parks. That being said it also lacked the ridiculously long quees. Waits were around 5 minutes! ",4
"A super small but cute Disney park   if you're a Disney fan you tick this park off in a day though, be warned, if you're used to the service in Walt Disney World and Disneyland, it doesdon't seem to  translate  as well at Hong Kong Disneyland. The food is also not as good   we had lunch from the Lucky Nugget Saloon, which was mediocre at best.A fun day though, regardless.",4
"Plaza Inn was fantastic, and the kids in our group loved the rides. It   s smaller than Disneyland, but if you love Disney, it   s worth the visit. If you   re not super into Disney, I   d probably skip and just go to Disneyland in Anaheim.",4
"We had a terrific time at Disneyland HongKong   rides were fun, waiting times ok, shows were enjoyable, very clean, staff super friendly   only let down was average food but to be expected.",4
"It was very essay to go from the city to Disney central Station. We bought tickets on sight with the additional VIP Status so that we diddon't have to line up.It was a week day and the park was not full  it was heaven. My only downside to the experience was that the main castle that appears on all their publicity was under reparation and it was very hard to find a restaurant with a variation of vegetarian food unless you liked pop corn, corn on the cob or a vegie burger in one of their fast food outlets. We really enjoyed our selves and so will you. Mind you I am 50 and my friend is 30 something...so it works for adults as well.",4
"I visited here with my parents and 2 teenage sisters, we had a really fun day! The food offerings were good (albeit expensive). It was incredibly busy, but I think all Disneyland's are! Very easy to get to from Central Hong Kong. I think my highlight was the gift shop which was huge!! I would definitely recommend for a family day out.",4
The hotel is clean and tidy . The environment is nice . Staff in this hotel is very nice and effective . Swimming pool is good for children . A good resort feeling hotel and a lot of activities for children to play . Better to provide the photo taking for the hotel guest with Disney Explorers Micky as a souvenirs with the Explorer bathrobe .,4
My son and his wife and three children recently visited Disney HK. They had a great time exploring it and said there were virtually no lines!!The one fault they found was in the food. Children   s food was very lacking in variety and taste. Our grandson who must be gluten free had no selections on the children   s menu that he could eat. They had to purchase a $60 steak that was not the best either. They have frequented Disney in the US and it is very conscious of allergies and gluten free menu items are readily available. I would implore the Hong Kong ownership of this American icon to be more sensitive to these needs and make some much needed improvements to their menus.,4
"During a recent stop over in Hong Kong we paid a return trip to Disney. We chose a day when the park was quiet so our longest wait was 30 minutes I am sure this is not the case at other times.Unfortunately some of the rides were being tested or being upgraded. To prevent disappointment check out closures before you go.We didn   t eat in the park as previous experience of it   s restaurant were disappointing and very expensive.This was our third visit to the park, whenever we visit Hong Kong a visit to Disney is a must.",4
We had an impromptu trip to Disneyland on a weekday. I love the trip because there is no wait time or at least 15minutes wait time for the rides. Limited restaurants though because maybe it   s a weekday? The bad part though is that the castle is under renovation and there are on going construction in the park. ,4
"It's my second time here but it's my daughter's first time in HK disneyland.Staff were nice but we weredon't given much priority despite being 7mos pregnant. Overall, the theme park is still nice however, the comfort rooms were not well maintained.Shocked to find that regular malls and even Ocean Park provide toilet cleaner liquid dispenser in every cubicle and Disneyland has none! Maybe it's time to upgrade it as well.",4
"great way to spend a day in Hong kong as a tourist, easy to wander through the park and lots of fun, overall good value, found some good souvenirs along the way..food a little expensive as is with most parks a should do if your over that way",4
"We've been here quite a few times and one of the better Disney's as queues are short and small enough to see everything in a day.We went mid week so was lot quieter and bought our tickets through Klook which was easy, but many of the rides attractions were under refurbishment and around 50% of the restaurants were closed (presumably due to less people). Price stays the same though! So you may want to double check in advance if you really want to experience any that might be closed to avoid disappointment.",4
This was our first family trip to Disney as a family (hubby and I have been to LA before we had kids). We left the hotel at 8.30 am even though the park didn   t open until 10.30. I   m glad we did as it took a little while to get there and get tickets etc. We bought the Priority line pass for an extra HKD$299 but it was a big waste of money as the park wasn   t busy and we only had to wait once for a ride. As the park wasn   t busy there were many food shops that were not open. Our kids (13 and 10) loved the rides and went of a few of them several times. My 10 year old cried when we were leaving as she didn   t want to go   so she must of had a good day! It was long and our feet hurt by the end of the day because of all the walking but it was definitely worth it to see the kids having such a good time. We don   t AUD$670 on 4 tickets including priority line passes. ,4
Friendly staff and cooling weather! Used Klook to purchase discounted tickets and scan QR code to enter was easy and fast. Enjoyed the time with my kids,4
"Smallest Disneyland and spent a day here. Having just gone to Tokyo Disneyland in February and comparing with this one in Hong Kong, I would say that this is a smaller theme park. However, they have packed quite a lot of activities and rides into a smaller area so there are still a lot to do for a day. In fact, Hong Kong Disneyland is newer and has more updated areas such as Iron Man and the upcoming Ant Man. Not very crowded when we were there during a week day but there are still short queues for the rides.The parades during the day and night were similar with most Disneyland but shorter and not as many floats. Went for the Mickey show as well as Lion King shows and they were enjoyable.",4
"I'm a big Disney park fan and a regular visitor to Disneyland Paris, so I was very excited to visit a new Disney park. We had a great time here, but compared to Paris, Tokyo and Florida (the others I've visited) it was very small with a limited number of rides and no real thrill rides. Space Mountain was very tame compared to all other versions.I'm serious about my Disney parks but struggled to fill two days here   I'd recommend only visiting for one day.The highlight was the shows   the Lion King show and the Wondrous Book were the best quality shows I've seen in any Disney park. The staging, live singing and performances were all very impressive.The food options are also really good with lots of variety.",4
While it's not as great other Disney properties. This park as all the fun rides and attractions to give you the Disney fix. Mystic Manor is a great unique ride that plays the part of the SEA story that Disney is trying to tell. Overall it's fun to go visit when the crowds are low. Be sure to check your timing before booking your visit.,4
"We made it to Honk Kong Disney on the MTR and it was easy, quick and pretty convenient. We purchased our tickets onsite and used the online 10% discount for foreign travelers just by showing the web page and our drivers licenses. Much easier than buying online. I downloaded the app and it was great as a map and to track wait times for the rides. Most rides had 5 to 40 min waits. I recommend getting the fast pass for Dumbo as it was the only line that took MUCH longer than the advertised wait time. We were able to get on all the rides and still make it back on the MTR at a decent time but the train was pretty packed. Overall a very manageable and enjoyable Disney experience in a day.",4
"HK disneyland was a great experience during Xmas, the celebrations and rides were great. People management was also top notch. Renovation of the main castle was undergoing when we went which was a disappointment so was the main night parade cancellation. We waited till the last moment but rains ruined it. Some refund or voucher would have been appreciated for cancelled show and castle renovation.",4
"I have been there 5 years ago with my wife..Now, i go there with my children..It's really nice to spend time with your kids in this theme park..Some problems:1. Castle is under renovation2. No fireworks3. Lion king under renovation4. Princess photo is limited only (no elsa of frozen is available for the photo session).. quite sad because she is my daughter's favorite princess...",4
We liked this compared with United States because its easier to navigate because its smaller and there are more rides for little ones. We went on Wed. and the line was short. Only from 5 minutes to 15 minutes wait. Unheard of in the USA. You can get here easily with MTR. Expect to spend a day here. They open at 10 am. The Moana show and the Disney Tale Story Show was our favorite.,4
"We had a fun day here, it was quite busy and wait times were roughly 20   30 minutes per ride. Plenty of eating places and souvenir shops available. There were a couple of good rollercoaster rides, but nothing like Disneyland in USA. I would still recommend it for a good day out.",4
"Optimal size to try most rides in one day, if queue is less than 30 minutes. I wish there were more affordable gifts in shops and food and beverages.",4
"Tickets were cheaper than other Disneys. Fast Pass was the bomb as we pre bought. The best rides were Mansion and the Grizzly Man Coaster. Space Mountain is not as good as Florida, California and even Paris. Ironman is okay. Pooh bear is good. This park is way smaller than the others which keeps the day simple. You only need one day here.",4
"Came here 1 day after Chinese New Year, it was very crowded, try googling for the best time to visit the Disneyland. They had a few big parades around the theme park at certain hours, the last one was at 2000 hrs. To avoid rushing back with other visitors, I tried staying back after the last parade and got on the MTR after most of the visitors had left.The theme park provide strollers for rent, be careful not to lose the deposit slip or they woulddon't cash your deposit when you return the strollers.My kids enjoyed every parade especially the last one at 2000 hrs, with all the lightworks and Disney characters out on the street.",4
"An Amusement Park for all ages. Disneyland is for children and a adult that are young at heart. Its a place that you will enjoy. The best time to visit is March were the weather was good, that you will enjoy roaming around.",4
"Nice and cute small Disney. Attractions do slowly expand, but most are just fun rollercoasters for family. Many smaller rides to enjoy with small kids. Bring your water bottle, drinks and food are expensive, not many choices. Jedi show is a must for younger ones, besides are the eateries worth going to.",4
Not a very best disneyland but it   s still makes you happy to play there. Disneyland rides not as extreme as universal atudio because this build for all ages. Just enjoy your time and play!,4
This is a smaller park than American Disneyland. My favourite part was the lion king show. It had great costumes acrobatics makeup and props. My grandson does not want to go to Theatre but changed his mind after this show. Staff were sometimes too busy talking to other staff to assist and sometimes abrupt. Overall though we had a great time. I think American Disneyland set a huge standard that was hard to match. ,4
"Came here once with my parents some years ago. Came here again for another visit. The rides are okay but as usual, super crowded and busy, especially the lunch hours where the queue can be as long as 45 mins to an hour. Food is so so, especially for the Starliner restaurant that serves western food. Ticket came with a food coupon for purchase of meal up to $149HK. Bought the recommended value set to maximise it but the burger was so pathetic, small, flat and the meat was half. ",4
Spent whole day and coming early avoiding crowds. It   s good to buy tickets ahead and avoid public holidays. Weekend could be tough but week days better. Accessible by metro . You are in hot commercial and consumer ares when they are not many things possible to resist. Enjoy the artificial words and attraction. ,4
"We lived in FL & CA and have been to Disney World and Disneyland on many occasions. Although this one is far smaller than the others, we're glad we went. There is a special train that takes you there. There is an obsession with Duffy at the park. We went on a week day and entered when the park first opened. The only lines we encountered were for the characters. Easy to do in 1 day. Lots of great food options that is not your typical Disney fare. We quite enjoyed the time spent there.",4
Disneyland is really for kids. The rides are way too short in time compared with counterpart rides in Universal Studios.  Kids would love the 'Mickey and the Wondrous Book' and Lion King shows!!!,4
"Spent a few hours at Hong Kong Disneyland. Easy to get to on the MTR. The queues weredon't long on this day, which was fabulous. The castle is not open at this time, it's being updated. It's Disney, so of course, everything is pricey. The main street parade was really good.",4
"On my daughter's bucket list is to visit every Disney, so not going to Disneyland was not an option. If you are familar with the Disney's in the US, this one is much smaller. It had a few of the larger rides, the Star Wars rollar coaster, Big Thunder Mountain and Mystic Mansion which is their version of the Haunted Mansion. Otherwise, the park is very kid friendly. We did get there when it opened and we stayed until it closed   which was a bit too long for me, but my daughter loved it.",4
"A must visit when in Hong Kong. Great for kids and big kids also. It was my first time to Disneyland. We got the 2 day pass as the weather wasn   t to great. It rained half way on our first day. If the weather forecast is sunny, buy the 1 day pass as we could of done it in the one if the weather fine. ",4
"Firstly, it   s Disneyland. It   s the happiest place on earth, and it   s great.It is a small park, at least by Anaheim and Tokyo standards, and can be easily covered in a few hours. This leaves plenty of time for shopping and hitting the rides you like multiple times.We came on a Tuesday in early March and arrived at park open. The weather was nice out, but the lines were, thankfully, almost non existent. Even after the usual busy times of 1 2pm, most lines were less than 15 mins.We bought a priority pass, but in hindsight it wasn   t at all required. In the end we just used it to get the value, but we were really just skipping 5 minute queues, so it was a waste of money on this particular occasion. Perhaps we got lucky and other days would make it worth the money but I am unsure.The RC car and Grizzly were my favourite rides, both extremely thrilling.Disneyland HK is a must see if you   re here, but not the best Disneyland in my experience.",4
"HK Disneyland is not the biggest or the best Disneyland, but I am grateful it is there. There are enough rides and attractions to make the trip worthwhile, and it is very easily accessible by the MTR Trains. Main disappointment Wes that there were no characters strolling thru the park to mingle with visitors. That may be because of overcast and potentially rainy skies. In any case, the weather also kept lines for rides very short   5 to 19 min max. No fast pass needed. I also like this Disneyland because you can still visit all the variety of parks paying one fee. In Orlando Florida, people have to buy a ticket for each of the four or five parks they want to visit, That gets really expensive. ",4
"If this is your first disneyland, you will love it. I visited other disney land as well, i found this one smaller as compared to others. Though, it still will give you a delightful experience. The rides are lesser but there's lots to do. IF you come first thing in morning, you will be occupied for the whole day.The biggest attraction is the Parade and dodon't miss the last parade in night   feast for your eyes. My family and my kid enjoyed it thoroughly",4
"It was always a dream to visit a Disneyland and it came to true when we visited HK Disneyland. You can easily reach thro MTR station and this is the most convenient mode. We went around the park, train ride, boat ride, tarzan house, magic 5D show, winnie phoo etc. Amazing to witness the main street parade. Huge food court available inside the premises. Overall it was a relaxing day out",4
"Disneyland never failed to amuse everyone  Excellent and friendly, park and attraction are great  Crews are great, speak english, and also nice hotels",4
Entering the HK Disneyland tend to bring back the child in you. While inside you'll forget your life's problems and if magically youre in a different world full of fun and fantasy. I love the rides but very few restaurants to choose from.,4
"I personally havedon't gone to a Disneyland outside of California so I didnt know what to expect. The cultural ties to the Chinese culture that they implemented at the park was simply amazing. This is probably the only park where Mickey can speak Cantonese. The park is very clean, it was smaller than your typical Disney park. There are various shows you can watch throughout the park. The rides are similar to what you would find in California. I believe the Iron Man attraction might be unique to HK. The park was busy but not to the point where we had to wait hours for a ride. It averaged 30 minutes or so per ride. If you're looking to experience something different from Disney, this would be the place to go. We only went for the day and was able to go on everything we wanted to go on. Just keep in mind that this park is smaller. I would not recommend coming here during Chinese New Year or Golden Week.",4
"First time I've been to Disneyland, so I have no benchmark for comparison. Smaller than I expected, but big enough to fill a full day for two adults. Lots of fun to be had, though some of the rides are aimed at children, so dodon't be disappointed if you're too big to fit on them. The Disney train was very cool, and had a real air of excitement...Join Mickey and Minnie for the day and enjoy :)",4
"Most of the staff members are friendly and accommodating. We were there on over chinese new year and the place was packed. The lines were a bit too long and a lot of people. During the parade, the Disney employees who were in charge to keep the crowd away from the floats were cranky and ill mannered. Disneyland is really a beautiful place. There were restaurants and food carts at every corner. The restrooms were all big and clean. The rides and attractions were enjoyable enough that you would want to see ride them again. ",4
"If you have a kid with you, you would have her or his eyes feast on all the attractions here. It isdon't as big as Ocean park but it is good for those who have been wanting to see Micky Mouse in person. Sadly the time I was here is when the castle was renovated.",4
Very crowded most of the time and long queue for rides. Food limited choice and quite pricey.  Kids can collect stickers given out by staffs all over the place. Just need to approach the staffs for free stickers,4
"I visited the Disney parks at LA as well as Florida but really impressed with Hong Kong Disneyland during the last visit. It was well connected, well organized, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. It's good for a full day visit but it needs some planning so that one must decide on what shows to watch and which fast passes to gather.",4
"Had a great day here.  Lines get long very quickly, so was glad we got there early and huge crowds.  They have terrific souvenir shops of which prices were not to bad and the food was very good, especially the caramel popcorn   amazing.",4
"this was a very interesting park because although it was very crowded, the line ups were never too bad... we went in with a plan because we only had one day... but we did enjoy ourselves. i suggest going shopping early in the day because the people there were savages! the store workers couldnt even keep up with people throwing things on the floor and all over the shelves... what a mess!! it was a terrible store experience and i waited 45 mins just to pay! the park was fun   the space mountian was fantastic but the shopping was awful so just know that going in   only need one day for this park",4
"Such a lovely place that really took me back to my childhood. Although queue can get long and the fast pass is not logical, the displays are great! The rides are great! A few good food options! Parade was great! Fireworks great! Great shows! Really enjoyable and can spend the whole day here. It   s a small Disney Land but really lovely. ",4
We never had went Tokyo Disneyland or Shanghai Disneyland. Hong Kong Disneyland was our first Disneyland. It was not crowded so we can enjoy 4 hour stay.,4
Each visit is just as magical as the last. My son always enjoys meeting the characters and the food that's shaped like Mickey. Would only recommend that they have other food options other than the exiting ones as variety for those that visit frequently,4
My kids love it. Lots of rides for children and adults. Food is good and lots of places to buy souveniors.,4
"The rides, views, and character actors were marvelous. I highly recommend the Lion King Festival (at least I think that   s the title of the show) as the music and dance is spectacular for anyone who enjoys enjoyed the movie. The night parade was a bit too crowded for my taste (I got slightly injured due to the immense number of people) but the parade was fun to watch. Getting on rides isn   t too difficult as the queues are usually only 20 30 min long.                                                                                                        .                                                                                ...                               (       3          )                          !    **   ,    **                                                                                                                  . ",4
Went with 2yrs old and 5yrs old. 5yrs old had fun since he already know how to enjoy and knowing the characters. Crowded as usual as i went during a Sunday and its CNY period. Most rides are kids friendly.There's much more attractions compare to many years back during my first visit. Great for both kids & adults.,4
A wholesome place to take the kids. Only gripe was that the Its A Small World Ride was closed due to upgrading. Love the food that caters many cuisines both Asian and Western. Don   t miss the Light Saber churros : ),4
"My friend and I ended our Hong Kong trip at Disneyland since we had a late flight out that evening. We checked out of our hotel (purchased tickets through our concierge which included the bus ride there). We dropped off our luggage right before the entrance to Disneyland for a reasonable fee there is a special place at Disney to hold your luggage for the day. Small Disneyland compared to Anaheim and Florida but definitely fun to see and experience. The food inside the park was disappointing. Overall, if you have time to see this after you have experienced the rest of Hong Kong, it's worth the time. MTR station right at the exit, easy to catch it and then catch the Airport Express.",4
"very nice place. i love it so much. very big and spacious. the rides are very modern, the parade of disneyland figures is also very beautiful and nice. unfortunately when i was there, the disney castle was under renovation so i coulddon't see the fireworks show.",4
"Went to Disneyland with my family and indeed, it   s the place for small boys and girls but also for adults. It brings back fun memories of being a child. Place is a bit small compared to the other Disneyland. Also, a lot of renovations are going on. A bit disappointment was the parade of lights since not all characters were present during the parade. Felt like we were cheated.Over all, it   s nice to experienced and see the difference from the other Disneyland places.",4
"It was fun to go to HK Disneyland. We stayed at one of the Disney hotels and took the private bus there. We had pre purchased tickets   and be aware that there is a great senior discount!This was my first Disneyland in Asia, and my understanding is that Tokyo Disneyland is better. Disneyland HK is smaller than the two parks in the US. It was oddly similar, and yet oddly different. The park was clean. Small World was being refurbished when we were there, so we were not able to check it out. Some fun things to note:1. They have Star Wars chopsticks in the Star Wars shop! Wish I'd bought more. 2. We had Indian food for lunch, and it was spicy but good.3. They had the usual Disney signs with rules before you get on a ride, but I dodon't recall seeing  You should be sober  as part of the instructions in Anaheim or Orlando! Disneyland is out on Lantau Island. Although we had fun, I would probably spend my time doing other things next time. ",4
We chose a Chinese National holiday to visit Disneyland so it was busy but as we were travelling with small kids we were too worried about going on a lot of rides. We had bought the meal deal tickets but found they weren   t good value as they limited our choices for lunch. The Moana show was great and the park was easily accessible for our 2 year old. ,4
"It is really one of the happiest place on earth. The ambiance of the themed park will make you feel young and free. As for sure, you will enjoy the rides. Sadly, when we went there the castle is under construction so the disneyland trip isn   t complete. ",4
"I've gone to both Disney parks in California and Orlando and while HK Disneyland is very small in comparison, I loved how this park wodon't have you exhausted by the end of the day and still allow for other activities after you've finished your time. This was how I scheduled my time with my friend. 11 am met a friend at Nam Cheong MTR and rode over to the Disneyland Line. A smart thing to do would be to buy your tickets on your phone as you are riding the MTR. (We diddon't and wasted some time at the ticket gate)Once we were in we took our rounds of pictures. The first impression was,  Wow, that's the castle? How awful.  Though when I was there they blocked off the castle so they will be making a more robust castle soon from what I'm understanding.In other parks like Japan and the USA, it's all about looking for the snacks all around the park. (Here's looking at you Dole Whip) I need to get this out of the way, the food is awful at HK Disney. This fact really surprised me given that there's so much good food in HK but it really was pretty horrid. Friend and I had some bad lunch and then went along to other rides. Most rides were about a 20 minute wait which I thought was very acceptable. I think the longest wait we had was for Hyperspace Mountain and that was for 40 minutes.Checked out the parade and was actually hoping for Asian women dressed up as Cinderella or Snow White. Nope. God forbid Snow White is an Asian. But I suppose I get it. lolAfter some snack fails and a Philharmagic 3D show we exited the park at around 6 pm. Took the MTR straight to Tsim Sha Tsui for a nice dinner at 7 pm. At 9 pm, friends and I were parked at a whisky bar and then by 11:30 pm I was home in bed.It was one of the most amazing days because this type of Disney excursion never happens in either California or Florida simply give the scale of the parks and also how awful public transportation is in either cities.I woulddon't recommend coming to HK for Disneyland, that would be a let down. However, if you're sightseeing in HK and have time for Disney, it's a no brainer to go.",4
We were in Hong Kong in September. The park is smaller than the other three that we have previously visited but has all the expected rides and features. It was pretty quiet on the gay of our visit.,4
"We were lucky because the weather wasdon't great when we went which meant it was quiet and we diddon't wait for any rides. If you have been to any of the others you may be dissapointed but its still beautifully put together. The rides are small but still lots of fun. I would recommend it for an afternoon or morning, you dodon't need to spend a full day. ",4
Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest of the Disney parks and not as crowded as Japan. They have the new Ironman ride attraction but some of the old ones have been closed and being replaced.,4
"Small park so u can finish in one day or maybe less.. Still interesting everytime i visit, its Disneyland in the end..",4
"A concierge at the hotel found my phone that I had left in a taxi, and woulddon't accept a tip for this! They truly go above and beyond. The actual park isdon't as great. They're very rigid with what seem like silly rules and the large amount of older teen early 20's girls with attitudes as their main attendees isdon't great. Courtesy from other guests just doesdon't happen here as it's all about the selfie.",4
"What a day, you could easily spend more than one day. Heaps for the young, old and young at heart. If you dont like adrenaline rush rides there are plenty of other rides and sights to see. Long waiting period for the rides. Great parades and light shows at dusk are breath taking. A must to go, Be prepared for a long day. ",4
My daughter and I had a great day at Disney. We got there when it opened and did most of the rides at least once before it got busy. Would recommend getting fast passes for repeat rides and then enjoying other rides whilst waiting for your fast pass time. Food is expensive and not great. Overall a good day out   we had fun esp as it was Xmas and the decorations were nice. ,4
Overall a small park compared to the other Disneyland. Definitely only need a day there. When we went in late April it was very hot and we ended up buying a umbrella which was brilliant for the day. Sadly the castle wasdon't open when we were there and surrounded by wire fencing which made photos hard. Overall a splendid day and lines were not an issue at all the max we had to wait was 20 mins,4
"My first experience to Disneyland n it was great. Had so much fun with my partner. From space ship roller coaster, to andy toy story, tarzan tree house, cool mickey mouse show, until the unexpected backwards train ride. It was great n very challenging, well got me screamed a few times lol. Worth to come back !! For all age.. u r welcome ",4
"I visited this superb amusement and theme park two times already. On this last visit , I took my 86 yr old father with me. He enjoyed like a child. The whole area is divided into 7 zones and each of the zones is uniquely planned and designed with the speciality of that zone in mind. Each zone has a ride, a show , an eatery for that area. I loved the Grizzly bears mining area with that stupendous ride!! The zone is planned with hot water geizers and rocky mountainous type. Excellent. Also the space ride area was too good. Starwars themed people were going around. The ride was great. I also liked the Little children's boat rides. The shows were a little less exciting for us. Because it's really for the small kids. There is a nice rail line around the park for easy travel. We bought the online tickets from the website. That made the enty super easy. Also I had the priority pass for us  that's free, my father had the senior ticket very cheap. The passes really helped us to see everything fast. U need to walk around a lot. But lots of resting places and refreshments are available to take it slow. Protect your head with hats.One day finishes like a sweet dream. Interested people can take the two day ticket if so inclined. There is also a hotel inside which can be included in the package. At designated times there are themed festivities, procession and fireworks which attracts lot of crowds. The journey from the city takes around 1 hr. Discounted tickets are available from klook dot com also. Overall, a lifetime dream came true for me. I have been dreaming of going to disneyland from the last 40 yrs minimum. I am very happy. ",4
"It's been a long time since last step into HK Disneyland. (Actually, less than 1 year ago, as I went for the HK Disneyland run that run thru the park...and I went for the 2018 edition again this time lol)So this time into the park direct to see the shows and some of the rides. (Frankly, the queue is scary; unless you go first thing in the morning, or buy  get the fastpass, 1 day is not enough to see ALL the shows  rides... ) Ok, certain things are under renovation   including the well loved Castle, and thus the fireworks at night though never stay that late.Stay for the new Mona show, Lion King show, the favorite Small World ride, the Pooh ride, ...and of course the well loved parade.As usual, magical at least for me to see Mickey and most of the Disney characters.",4
The first thing on our agenda when we finished checking in the hotel was to go to Disneyland. It was a first time trip for my mom and my son. Even though we were tired from travelling we felt that the happiest place on earth would cheer everyone up. We bought tickets from klook which was very helpful. The lines were very long and we can   t seem to catch the best time for pictures with Mascots. We enjoyed the simple ride in Small World and the intense and visually interactive Mystic Manor.,4
"Our family of five (kids 4, 2, and baby) went to HK Disney and had a magical day. We found that there was plenty to do even with very small kids. The only unfortunate thing that happened was some inconsiderate staff hurrying us as we were delayed due to some baby issues. The other thing to note is that many shows are light on english     we still had fin but it modestly reduced our enjoyment at times. ",4
Me and my friend went here last Jan 15 this year.. we enjoy roaming around and the rides.. we didn   t get a chance to visit the other sides where the roller coaster is.. I thought they have a Ferris wheel but they don   t have.. and the castle is still under renovation that is why they don   t have a fire works display which supposed to have to complete your Disney trip.. I think it   s better to visit again if the castle is done.. ,4
"If you love disney land then this is something you have to do. Unfortunately i enjoyed Shanghai and Tokyo's Disney land wayyy better.. nothing wrong with the hong kong one, but i think its the smallest one. Basic rides. But again, if you are a Disney land fan like myself, then this is a must do",4
"3rd DL park visited after going to both the Anaheim parks.Went in January 2019, was 19 20 degrees Celsius. Perfect for walking around. Fantasy land and toy story land were always very busy but the rest of the park was generally quiet. Longest line I saw was dumbo ride with a 40 min wait. As DL HOTEL guest we got a few priority passes. We used these for the popular attractions and we lined up basically for 1 2 mins before walking onto a ride.Highlights: grizzly gulch mine car ride, iron man experience and hyperspace mountain.Favourite show: Mickey and wonderous book.Favourite parade: paint the night.Characters: in two days we saw about 15 characters. They seemed to be easier to access than California. They also interacted better. Overall: 1 day is enough for regular travellers. Disney freaks will need 2 days to see everything. We did 2 days and went on major attractions 3 4 times and just took our time. It was much less stressful than California! The castle is getting renovated and will be completed I believe next year. An ant man wasp attraction opens in March 2019. It was a great park and we had lots of fun!",4
"As a local, I have annual pass and bring the kids visit almost once a month. Despite the park is not big, and it is enough for a full day travel, and the extension may take a few years later, which perhaps a second day visit as well. My understanding there are some package tour to stay the Disneyland resort hotel and have compliment tickets to visit the theme park as well.",4
"Why would you spend all that money going to America when you could go to Hong Kong Disneyland?? We had a carefree trip there on the train arriving late morning. We saw the Lion King show, went on rides, watched the  Halloween Parade , ate, drank and had a ball and diddon't leave until after nightfall. Highly recommended..",4
"2 adults and we had a great time   ate burgers at the Starlight   went on a handful of rides, watched the big parade, rode the train and bought lots of souvenirs",4
Was at the park for 2 days in Jan on both weekdays. Park was not that crowded and most rides had waiting time of less than 30 mins or so. Weather was great as well. However there was no fireworks at the end of the parade on a weekday which was disappointing.,4
"We visited with two young kids and they called it a highlight of their holiday! It   s a v small park compared to the USA parks but still worth it. The rides were great, it   s worth getting the fast passes if you can. The best ride by far was the Iron Man ride   although there are much scarier ones! The toy story land was a winner with the kids (especially the hot wheels and soldier rides!) and they also loved the Main Street. The food isn   t great, but we didn   t expect it to be! If you   ve got kids and you   re visiting HK the park is definitely worth a visit for a day. ",4
"I got a    It   s My Birthday    badge and I   m all happy with it. The service crew gives excellent service and try to make everything as magical for their patrons as possible. The ride that one should never miss is the Mine Ride  totally worth it. I accidentally broke a piece of glass item in the shop, when I   m about to pay for it  the crew (female) didn   t want me to pay as they knew it was a genuine accident (Shop At Hotel Hollywood). ",4
"I assume its smaller than the one in Tokyo. Tried a few rides, not too extreme. The rain causing the parade to be cancelled, dissapointed but it was okay. Last minute to ride before the park closed. Can be expensive, but it was okay..",4
This park is not as crowded as the other disneyland parks and the layout makes it easy to hit all the big rides in a day. Two days would be ideal for completing all the shows and meet & greets. The food options are varied and quite good.,4
"If you   ve been to other Disney parks be prepared as this one is very small. Still has great attractions and feels like Disney. A number of attractions were closed when we visited so the one day pass was sufficient. Don   t get the add on meal vouchers though, not great value and restricts where you can eat from",4
"It was a bit of a disappointment when you have to queue up for nearly 30 45 minutes for a rides. Even you want to get fast pass for the rides, they can tell you no pass is available. Park is not big and you can walk around everywhere. With young kids you can rent their wagon for 120hkd per day. Entrance fees is comparatively high as compared to other countries. But still worth to come as the kids love it!!",4
"Our 6th visit to HK Disneyland. Everything is in close proximity and queues weren   t too bad   30 minutes tops. Not bad for New Year   s Day. Still a shame there are no fireworks, but knowing that beforehand we booked dinner when we would normally watch the fireworks display. ",4
"Average waiting time for the more popular rides is 30min. Back to the future is replaced by Ironman, I guess. Buzz Lightyear is also being removed. Hyperspace mountain is too bright and windy to open eyes and it's a crazy non stop high speed roller coaster ride. I prefer Grizzly Gulch roller coaster. The speed varies, including a backward ride. There's a cycle of high speed ride too but it's more bearable than Hyperspace mountain.Food is very expensive in the park, as expected. Average HKD120 for a meal.",4
"We went there with 2 days ticket as Disneyland offers this promotions, with 2@$15 voucher and free pop corn.Would strongly suggest to buy advanced online ticket to SKIP the line! You might want to compare official Disneyland with other online travel providers to get the best offer.This theme park is smaller compared to the Tokyo ones, yet as we went on Christmas holiday, around 50 mins waiting time is expected for each attraction, and in the end we can not try all rides. ",4
"We were here with our 11 year old son. It is a smaller park compared to the parks in the U.S. and definitely doable in about 7 8 hours. Our favorite rides were the Grizzly Gulch, Hyperspace Mountain, and Iron Man Experience. My number one tip is to get there right at 10:00. No lines to buy tickets to get into the park and super quick to walk over to the rides. We were there on a Thursday in January and we didn   t have any lines longer than 5 minutes until around noon. We also got a fast pass for Hyper Space Mountain in the morning to be sure we could come back again later without waiting. I would also recommend downloading the Hong Kong Disneyland app to see wait times and get a map of the park. We ate at the Main Street Corner cafe and the sweet and sour chicken and shrimp and the burgers were really good. It was easy to get here with the MTR and it took us about 35 minutes to arrive from Kowloon. I don   t think I would come here a second time, but definitely worth a visit at least one time. ",4
"We went with 3 girls aged 5 to 13, and there was enough for everyone, which surprised me as I thought the eldest would be bored. Although it is quite geared to little princesses, there are enough good rides and nostalgic experiences to entertain most. To be honest, I really wasdon't looking forward to this, as Disney isdon't my thing, and I loathe plastic environments, but it was well done, and much more entertaining than I'd anticipated. The Mystic Manor ride was good but the queue was abysmal, and not very clearly signposted. The riverboat ride was fantastic, largely because of the guide who deserves either an Oscar or a pay rise for her brilliant commentary. The Runaway Mine Carts ride was extremely good fun, and very well done in terms of safety. Most queues moved surprisingly quickly, and it was all relatively painless, even for a Disney cynic like me. I much preferred it to Disneyland Paris, which I found to be much more plastic and money grubbing.",4
"Having previously been to Walt Disney World, I decided to take my kids to Hong Kong Disneyland for their first Disney park experience. This decision was mainly based on it being a smaller park so a little bit easier on their little legs. They absolutely adored it! My six year old went on every ride (apart from RC Racer due to height) and apart from Mystic Manor (which he found a little scary), he loved them all. The look of delight in my three year old   s face was also sweet. It was a fantastic warmer for the bigger parks in the U.S.A. One day park? Definitely not. We did every single ride (apart from RC Racer and Tarzan   s House) and every single show (apart from Moana) and parades, net characters, did none of the gardens and we just fit it into two days. And we were there from open to close with a stack of fast passes in hand. Maybe we were slowed down due to having little kids with us but I don   t know how people do the park in one day and do it justice. Where the park lost a star was the food and merchandise. The food was gross. That   s all I can say about that. The merchandise? Well unfortunately there were heaps of shops on Main Street but they all stocked exactly the same merchandise. Apart from Pandora which I don   t personally wear, there was nothing for adults. The variety just wasn   t there and the selection that was there was poor. Would I go back? Probably not now that it has been done but we are looking forward to the next Disney park. ",4
We were here at a busy time of year so there were long queues for most rides and limited express passes but it's disneyland so still well worth a visit. They have WiFi but it's very patchy. It's expensive as you would expect but the kids loved it. ,4
"Disney is going under a process of renovation. There are great things to come. Still, being there is a great experience.",4
"Rides wise, kids will enjoy. Tyere are no edtreme rides. Food are on fair price. Got a 3in1 meal promo w our ticket. Best to go to tge rides you want in the morning w less waiting time thennget a fast pass on other rides tgen come back later. You   d really reminisce your childhood on this one.",4
"You can get here from Sunny bay MTR station interchain tonMTR disneyBought 2 day pass in December friendly weather in first day 25, get promo for 2X popcorn 2X Disc HKD 15. Ride also friendly for children below 5. The new ride is Iron Man 3D SPACE ship. And Moana dance performance. There 2 rides that you can enjoy fast pass. Space mountain and Winny the pooh. So come and collect your fast pass ticket firstResto will be full of crowd and long Q, suggest yo have early or late lunch, and bring yor snack for delaying your lunch. Parade entertaint us in the afternoon and a singing fire works performed in the closing day 8 pm but unfortunately this time, the castle is under renovation no fireworks this Xmast. ",4
"I've been to Tokyo Disneyland and Anaheim Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland is smaller but certainly if you're already in Hong Kong dodon't miss it. The Ironman Experience, the Hyper Space Mountain and the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Cars are the best attractions.",4
"My kids very enjoyed it especially Mytic Monor, Lion King Show and Story Book Show. The show was superb and we had wonderful time in Hong Kong Disneyland.",4
I recommend exploring the adventure zone at first then others because the queue was extremely long. Average waiting time was about 40 70 min.,4
The park is very well organized. The support staff is helpful. There are lots of brochures and maps and restrooms. The restrooms are clean.Its easier to walk around and is manageable.Vegetarian food options are almost nil. Road side stalls area is smelly with non veg food.Rides are safe with safety checks. The staff checks them all before starting.The queues are long for each ride... about 40 min.We enjoyed the park !!!,4
"I was with my 2 little kids while visiting Disney Land during raining day unfortunately , we were upset that the Train of Disney railroad in Fantasyland to mainstreet was close on time at 6pm even RAINING !! it should be operating to send as many visitors as it could back to the main street in order to get home or get back to the main place for dinner. In fact, many people were wet without the alternate option but to walk all the way to Main Street even some without rain suit and umbrella ...",4
"Visited Disney Land with my Wife and three year old Daughter. My daughter loved it, the kids friendly rides, musical & the shows. Good place for kids to go. Though limited rides for adult, however if going only for kids, they will like it and recommended. ",4
"The castle was closed! No Street Parade! Pricey food and souvenirs! When they will re open the castle? No definite time, maybe sometime in 2019 or 2020? It was unlucky to us NO CASTLE NO STREET PARADE instead a projector show and Mickey will appear sometime on an elevated stage.Though my teens got an unforgettable experience. This visit happened in the first week of October 2018. Try to choose another month and date if possible because this is the busiest season, so what you expect:1. Very very Long queue 2. Very pricey3. Very hot4. Very noisy5. Plenty of long walksPrepare your wallet, prepare your stamina, prepare for the crowd.The Iron Man experience was the best so far. The small world ride and show was just too much. Dodon't miss the book reading show, A day is not enough to take all the rides and shows because the long queue made it so difficult for you to finish or watch them all.Book your tickets ahead of time to make sure you wodon't waste even more time queueing to get tickets because definitely, you need more time to tour the whole place.",4
"This is the third time I had visited Disneyland Hong Kong with my boys. Each boys had a visit and of course the eldest had three! Each of these visits never fail to entertain us and making us enjoy every moment here.Ambience: still as fun and enjoyable as the first time I had visited it in 2013. The party mood is everywhere!Service: the staff are so accommodating and always strive to make everyone happy. They are helpful and never seems to be agitated by our request.Rides and Games: there are some new entertainment, e.g. iron man and Star Wars. Even the older games are so well maintain and clean. I still enjoy them.Food pricing: as in all theme park, food and drinks are expensive. A meal cost us an average HK$120 150. Do pack some drinks for your kids to save up on the drinks part.Disneyland HK well done! I feel so like a child every time I am back here. :)",4
"I really enjoy it. Reminder to download their apps, check out all the busy rides first and get the fast pass",4
"There were several changes like mickey and the wondrous book, l love mickey night musical, grizzly mine ride.",4
Enjoyed the parade and snow fall..pretty packed during parade though..no more fireworks as the castle is under reno .,4
Was there for 2 days (Sunday n Monday) during December holidays. My daughters are happily posing with the Disney princesses n enjoying some of the rides. Enjoyed watching the Mickey and the Wondrous Book.  Food was ok in Disneyland but could have improved better.,4
"If you are a disney fan..so this is the place that you should go. Interesting 4D rides, entertaining live shows ( lion king ), met up disney characters, beautiful disney props ( castle ) & exciting souvenir shops. Few might think disneyland for younger kids ( definitely agree ). Adults who like mickey, minnie & donald duck can enjoy this place too. ",4
It's my family's first visit to HK Disneyland. The year end season provides both the climate and the atmosphere for christmas themed shows and celebrations taking place in the park though the day. It's a great place for children with various rides shows eateries which are family and child friendly. My only tip is to try and go on a weekday as the crowds in the weekend are understood to be really massive. I was there on a Monday in december and the crowd was sizeable with waits for rides going up to 30 minutes for the more popular ones. My thoughts are that a 1 day visit is sufficient unless you intend to go for all the rides shows and you have children with you.,4
Just like the other Disneylands but here in Hong Kong is quite small. We were there on Monday but still quite crowded.,4
"Too many places closed down for renovation. We did not experience a lot of fun stuff. We had fun with roller coaster, but that's about it. Personally, I like the shopping part. Their souvenirs are awesome, too many choices! Foods are expensive, but delicious. Not too much to say, but overall its a very good experience for us.",4
"Great day out for family, avoid weekends and July August. Nice new attractions and seasonal themes. bring your empty bottle with you, food and drink are very expensive.",4
"Always a nice entertainment, with good attractions. The only two negative aspects are the price and food options.",4
"The experience starts with taking the MTR to Disneyland. Very thrilling for the kids. Overall, the kids enjoyed themselves. Although it was crowded, the crowd control was done very well and they managed to get masses of people organised and happy. The shows were also quite a masterpiece both in terms of overall experience and showmanship. Enjoyed the ironman ride.",4
"This is our first visit to Hong Kong Disneyland. Our impressions are biased towards Tokyo Disneyland as we have been there prior to HK Disneyland. Apart from the rather small Sleeping Beauty Castle being under renovation, what stood out were how small the park was and expensive food. As it was not yet peak visitation and helped by slightly rainy weather (which also ruined some outdoor shows and parades), we managed to cover all the rides and shows we wanted in a day. Of all the attractions, we liked The Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wonderous Book, Iron Man Experience and Mickey   s Philharmagic.",4
"No matter which Disneyland you go, it's still the happiest place on Earth.  All visitors have a smile on their faces   both young and old.  Very conveniently located.  Seems like all roads lead to Disney",4
"As a resident of Hong Kong, and very close to Disneyland, we   ve been visiting here often ever since it opened. We used to have yearly passes for the whole family. It is such an awesome escape from the frantic, sometimes    dirty    city life that surrounds it. All the normal Disney characters can be seen plus a number of new (to Disney)    Marvel    characters and Marvel inspired rides. Favourites of our family include the Jungle River Cruise, Grizzly Gulch, It   s a Small World, TeaCup ride, Slinky Dog and Mystic Manor. The staff are almost always friendly and helpful and the shows and parades are ALWAYS jaw dropping and definitely not to be missed. Watch out for the sporadic street performances of the street sweeper drummers who have an amazing drum perscusion show based on their garbage bins and cleaning implements. Also watch out for the    cleaner    who paints (using water) Disney characters literally on the street road. There are only really two possible negatives to the Disney experience. A very limited selection of western style (and quality) foods in some of the Disney resteraunts. Lastly, if it   s a mainland China holiday Disney can be quite unpleasant with the crowds. The best plan is to ALWAYS try and get there for opening time for less queues and crowds. Having said that, the iconic fireworks show is well worth hanging around for. Oh, and get there by train. Disney has its own train station. It   s the cleanest, quickest, cheapest way to get there. Have a GREAT trip to Disneyland. I thoroughly recommend it.",4
"i visited here about 15years ago and it was great then. now not so sure. average waiting time was over 60 mins. food was not good. best option was the popcorn. public shows were great in main street, especially the Xmas show.if you go make sure you buy the express pass otherwise you will wait all day for a couple of rides..",4
"We are used to going to Disneyland & Disney World in USA and have been several times to Disneyland Paris and compared to Disneyland Paris it is very tiny, so be under no illusion it   s a very piece of Disney and not many of your favourite traditional Disney rides. That said we had a great time, we brought a 2 day pass as there was not much difference in price of 1 day before we went, we also purchased the food package of 2 meals and a snack. The food you get with this deal is very filling and we struggled to get through all the food we could have. The snack was either popcorn or an ice cream and the meals were full size dinners with soft drink. Everything that we ate was very tasty.Possibly the 1 meal and a snack option would have suited us better.It was very quiet there when we went and hardly had to queue for the rides and didn   t need to use fast passes at all.decorations for Christmas were really good but I was disappointed that there was not much In the way of Disney Christmas ornaments to purchase.All in all we had a great time, I still can   t get over how small the castle is, I thought the one in Paris was small but it   s huge in comparison to the one here.",4
"I already had my Disneyland experience in Anaheim, California USA and wanted my 7 year old grandson to enjoy the experience. We expected a big crowd, being a Saturday, and true enough, we had to fall in line for rides. We opted for less crowded attractions.In the bumper car area, the grandkid passed the height test but without notice that he had to be at least 8 years old, he was not allowed in. There were few staff members positioned to assist, and we had to get information from vendors manning their kiosks.What made our Disney experience worth it was the amazing parade. Sadly, there were no fireworks for is that night.",4
"Third Disney park we have visited as usual full of the Disney magic. Hong Kong has been the smallest one we have visited but also had the shortest queues and was not as crowded as OrlandoAnd Paris. The bus service from the park to the hotels is also much better than Paris as proper queueing system. Happy to of ticked another Disney off the list, ",4
"Great place to spend with the young ones, better for kids over 6 years as more rides options. Our favourite is the small small world and Mickey mouse 3 D cinema show. Toy story unable to due to her height and then 2 rides waiting timing was 50 mins. Do stay for 6pm and 6.30pm Christmas light and concert shows. The 8pm parade is worth while too. Pre purchase ticket via Klook cheaper but meal voucher I dodon't really suggest.",4
"The family spent one whole day in HK Disneyland and apparently it is still not enough. There were just so many things to see, watch, ride and do. We arrived just after the gates opened and already the place teemed with guests. It helped that we bought our tickets online (and cheaper) as we were able to skip the ticket counters and breezed through the entrance. We were greeted by rows of souvenir shops and rows of cheery greeters before the kids raced towards the rides. Us adults appreciated that there is (already) a Starbucks along the Main Ave which provided a caffeine respite every now and then. We appreciate the numerous pockets of benches for rests and very helpful staff who consistently provided assistance to our queries.We loved our photo ops with Cinderella and Snow White as well as the Lion King and Moana shows.",4
It   s a little small compared to other Disney parks. The castle and jungle cruise ride were closed.  The queues were short. My family had a great time.,4
"It   s always fun to visit Disneyland!The hype begins (if you   re commuting to Disneyland) when you transfer to the Disney train with Mickey Mouse shaped windows. Children will always have fun in Disneyland. The adults in our trip also appreciated adult friendly rides. Points for improvement:   cleaner and more accessible public toilets   healthier dishes in the menu for children  English as main language in rides and of characters mascots plays We ended up staying in Hotel Disneyland as well where the amenities and rooms were spacious, clean and stayed true to Disney designs. A little pricey, as expected but you get your money   s worth with the amenities, service, privacy and security of the property, and the decor. Sharing Disneyland train and Disneyland Hotel photos. ",4
"We had a lovely full day at Disneyland Hong Kong.We have been to Paris, California and Florida parks and Hong Kong is tiny in comparison but it is a still a fun day if you are in the area.The castle is still there but is partly obscured by construction walls and a crane   it will soon be demolished for a new super castle in 2019 which is really exciting.The park is mostly bilingual with English and Cantonese (and Mandarin on occasions)   we would it hilarious when Mickey and friends spoke in Cantonese.Tips:Highlights of the park that you have to go on   Mystic Manor (a unique experience amongst disney parks with a fusion of ratatouille and haunted mansion rides), Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Train (a fusion of Exhibition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain and a launch coaster), and Hyperspace Mountain (HKDL version of space mountain). We went on each of these twice and loved them. The rest of the park rides are the same similar as the rest of the parks around the world.Mickey and the Wondrous Book is a really special show and I highly recommend you see it. Each performance was full and it wasdon't until our third attempt did we get a seat! It's a fusion of Florida's happily ever after night time show and Paris's Peter Pan night time show. The live singing and performers were all excellent.Both parades were excellent and are your opportunity to see lots of characters at once. Arrive 30 minutes before to get your spot.If you want to meet characters get to the park for 9.30am. Gates open at 10 and there are lots of characters to meet on main street USA before the main park opens at 10.30   Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald and Daisy, Chip and Dale were all out and about.Only negatives of our day were the weak side show performances e.g. Moana home coming and the Christmas stage show. I'd avoid these and use the time to go on rides. Also the shops were always rammed and overflowing with queues snaking around the shop so you coulddon't find the end of the line. If you want to get gifts and dodon't want to queue there is a hong kong disney store at the airport with the same prices and a fair bit of stock.",4
"Entry was expensive, kids under 2.5 years free. A lot of people told us it wasn   t worth it and it will be crap however we did enjoy it. The kids are young so they rode on rides that suited their age group. Not a huge variety of food but there are a few restaurant cafes around. My only safety concern was lack of security guards or police presence. I caught a man taking pictures of my child along with other kids while watching the Moana live show. He was on his own not accompanied by a child or family. He was taking photos of young teenagers too. I confronted him to delete but he didn   t speak English. Managed to delete but this didn   t stop him doing it again. We spotted him a few times. While waiting for our turn on rides 2 other I saw two native people taking photos of my own children I asked them to stop and intervened but again people don   t speak English. They   d stare like it was completely normal and I   m over reacting. It made me very upset, angry and furious and this behaviour is unacceptable. Especially when it comes to children. When I contacted authorities and staff they didn   t seem to care. This is VERY VERY important that people are made aware and to be on alert. PLEASE WATCH YOUR KIDS AT ALL TIMES! don   t take your eyes off them. ",4
The best thing about this Disney land that it is allow most of the rides younger kids. I am able to visit most of rides with my 2 years old son. However if you visited any other Disneyland like Shanghai or Tokyo you might not feel very happy with this disney land as i coulddon't find any WOW factor in this Disney land. Food is expensive i would suggest to buy advance meal tickets from Klook and convert them to the vouchers at check in gates. ,4
"This is one of the smallest parks we have been to. Currently we have been to all of the Disney parks except Paris, hopefully next year. Allow yourself about a half day to see everything. There are about 3 rides worth the time to wait in line, Hyperspace mountain, Mystic Manor, and Grizzly rollercoaster. ",4
"Went on a week day which I would recommend as even then there were hundreds of people, didn   t have to line up longer then 10 minutes to go on rides , we both loved the iron man experience ! Food is very expensive and wasn   t that great cost over $100 aus for 1 burger a small serve of chick wings and 2 milkshakes . That aside we were amazed by everything the lights on all the buildings etc at night gave it a truely magical experience we felt like kids again ! We much preferred Disneyland over ocean park",4
"I have visited this theme park 6 times in my life. first time was with my mom and dad. Went three times alone and two times with my wife... This was my first theme park visit back in 2012. I was amazed and was wondering it to be dreamland. I rode every rides here. From thrill rides to the family rides. Well the best attraction was off course Ironman experience. Mystic Manor was cool, hyperspace mountain, rc racer, Grizzly mine car ride were all thrilling and exciting. Enjoyed the lion king and mickey mouse shows. River cruise was awesome. It's a small world was amazing. September is the month I recommend to visit. No long lines... Iconic castle is transforming dodon't know how long it would take. If the castle transformation is complete it would be my 7th visit...",4
"If you   re after a trip filled with coasters and white knuckle rides forget it, but if you want some good old Disney magic then it   s worth a visit. Quite a small park if you   re comparing it to other Disney resorts, the shows are very good, but no fireworks, no castle ( it   s under construction) and not many characters wandering around for photos. A good day out but a little disappointed to be honest. ",4
"Went with family , 2 children age 4 and 13.The Disneyland MTR was nice, took around 10 mins to reach the destination.We went on 7 11 2018, Weather was sunny ,no rain at all.We stayed Novotel City Gate hotel so it was 2 stations to Disneyland which was very convenience.",4
Need to plan which rides you want to go on and what you want to see as it   s too big to do everything. shows arrive about 15 20min early. rides were max about 30min to 1 hour wait without fast track on a sunday. Hit the ones you want to go first early to beat the crowds. I went for halloween and there was a good 2 for 1 deal on disney   s site that allows me to enter the park a second time before the end of this year. For popular characters expect at least 30 min to 1 hour waits to take pictures with them (eg. jack and sally for halloween). disney staff give out lots of stickers and candy during halloween. the villains night parade at the end is not as exciting as the one during the day or their regular one as the floats with the villains are plain comparatively. ,4
"It is indeed one of the happiest places on Earth though the rides are not as thrilling as the rides of Ocean Park HK. This park entertains its children audience visitors than young adults so if you're a solo traveler, Ocean Park HK I think would suit you.If you're going to watch some shows or presentations, you have to run around the park so expect to have feet soar lolNo fireworks display when I went but the parade would entertain you for sure!Overall, it's very good and you'll certainly feel like a kid after visiting this park",4
Actually I thought Disneyland would be for small kids. But it   s not. I went with my teenage that loved. Many attractions that for them was great. But be ready to stay long in the queue. And it   s a bit expensive but if you have energy you can spend the whole day there. Not my case. ,4
"After living in Hong Kong for a few months, I had not heard great things about HK Disneyland. But, I decided to go with some friends and had a really fantastic time! We got there right when it opened and the lines were quite short in the morning. We diddon't spend more than 20 minutes in a line! The park is small; I was able to go on my favorite rides multiple times throughout the day, with and without fast passes. Because of its size, visiting the park is one day is more than feasible. I personally loved Space Mountain and Grizzly Gulch rollercoasters.The food was not as good as food at other Disney parks. The Mickey waffles and ice cream were tasty, but the popcorn wasdon't warm and the sandwiches from bakeries on in Street barely had any meat and cheese in them. I recommend bringing your own food into the park.I woulddon't get a season pass for HK Disney because it's too small and it would get old quickly if I went there too often, but I will definitely visit every once in a while!",4
"Although it's not big as others, people coming here is less than others too and hence we managed to play all the rides and watch all the shows here which is great as the waiting time usually no more than 20 minutes.However, when we were here, the castle is still under renovation so there's no firework which is supposedly the highlight in any Disneyland.The popcorn here also doesdon't has the special box like in Tokyo. Just a normal packaging.",4
"Hong Kong disney, was a marvellous place for their parade and shows. The rides were great for young kids. There are no real thrill rides , most rides a 5 yr old can go on , but it was an amazing park, ride lines at its longest was 25 minutes, which was great. Well worth it",4
"We must have been super lucky as the day we arrived we didn   t queue for any rides   the most was approx 10 minutes which of course makes the day more fun! We managed to get on everything including the Lion King show which was incredible! In comparison, I think this park beats Paris. It   s obviously not cheap but the food is surprisingly ok and we had a great day! ",4
"Visited in March 2018 on a Sunday. Due to weekend, there were too many visitors and long queue for all the rides   attractions. Had to skip several rides due to their long waiting time. However, whatever rides we took, most of these were not that thrilling. There were 2 parades on that day, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. Both were fun to watch, especially the evening parade with illumination was very attractive. There were no closing fireworks, told that it had been discontinued. There are restaurants inside the park, however foods were expensive and average in taste. It is an expensive affair; entry tickets, inside food etc. all are overpriced. Though at the end it was tiring, but overall it was a fun filling day spent at HK Disney Land.",4
Felt like a kid again. Obviously smaller than the originals but still entertaining and an experience for those that havent been to the originals,4
"Never having been to Disneyland before, I found it very entertaining. The space was huge and they had a very convenient luggage holding area for us to leave our luggage at HKD 110 per piece. A lot of walking involved, so was very glad we wore comfortable shoes and clothes. We bought discounted tickets via Klook and could get in with no problem. Once inside, we went to look at the rides and a lot of them were not thrill rides, but fun nonetheless. I was very impressed with the amount of detail that went into creating the rides and their upkeep. Everything is perfectly maintained and no chipping paint to be seen anywhere!Delicious food is nowhere to be found in Disneyland, though. So it's just eating to survive, and your tastebuds are not taken into consideration. We managed to take all the rides we wanted to, and still take in some shows before the park closed. In the evening, the lines were much longer, because HK residents came for the evening with their annual passes. It can rain anytime in HK, so pack a raincoat if you have it. Even if it doesdon't rain, it will come in handy on the mine train ride. The parade at the end of the day was really cool! Since it was halloween season, all the Disney villains came out to play.",4
"Visited with a 11 months old baby and managed to do some rides. It   s an all age friendly park, great for a one two days visit.",4
"We had a lot of fun in the park, and the new motion games like Iron Man was very enjoyable. However, the park was under renovation, so the sleeping beauty castle and the fireworks were not there. How I wish I could watch the fireworks in front of the castle!Note: the haunted house is small and boring, not worth waiting in a long long queue. The grey bear mine, the star wars track, iron man are my favorite. The star wars track has speed pass, which is worth fetching asap.Wifi is extremely slow. Dodon't rely on it! Bring your phone with the best signal, because mobile signal is weak there.",4
Nothing out of this world but good scenery and organization. What i liked the most was the robot trash bin going around by itself and talking :D,4
Like all Disneyland's throughout the world it's primarily designed for the kids. I recommend taking the MTR out to this theme park. Like I said Disneyland is more for the kids than adults but lets face it we can be kids again for a day. I recommend staying and watching the nightly fireworks show which begins at 8pm nightly.,4
"Disneyland hong kong was the 1st Disneyland I have ever visited. It was great experience for me, my daughter and my close friend. My daughter, who is 2 really enjoyed the places the story time. It was a best place to celebrate her 2nd birthday.I truly recommend this place, it's ideal for kids and adults.",4
"We visited HKDisneyland in 2013 when it had been opened for 5 days, we loved it. We had read recent mixed reviews and decide would revisit and so glad we did. The MRT trip from downtown Kowloon is simple to say the least and took about 50 mins. The gates open at 10am for a wander and many photo opportunities with well loved characters, the    lands    open at 10.30am. The new Ironman experience was easy for a couple of grandparents and we thought the transformer ride at Universal Studios much more exciting. Young and old would love it....youths would find it tame. The staff are all friendly and extremely helpful and do their best to make it a happy place. We visited today, midweek and there were no lines for anything, whatever rude or experience you wanted you just wandered to it. There were 3 Main Street parades doe to being Halloween I think. They were good, quick and not crowded. The Lion King Show is a stand out, it was in 2013 and still is. The Star Wars ride is just the old Space Mountain ride with a new name. We enjoyed Toy Story land. As grandparents we enjoyed watching the expressions on the faces of children mostly aged between 3 to 6 they were in their element. I can   t imagine teenagers thinking it was very exciting.Would we recommend it.....yes would we do it a third time....probably not,Still if you   ve never been to Disneyland and can   t get to USA...do it.",4
Suprisingly the theme parks are quite accesible with the MTR. Dodon't be surprised this place gets REALLY crowded. Twice came across with the mascots but what a shame we diddon't get to snap photos with them. The guides will be there to stop the queue halfway so make sure to be there early! The rides are OK but I really love how the entire place just brings back my childhood. ,4
"The Disneyland is small (at least compared to Paris Disneyland)   so one day is enough if you are visiting on a weekday.On weekends, use the fast track facility to utilize your time efficiently.Tips for visitors.  Visit on weekday (avoid weekends and holidays)  Carry food with you   you can save time and money.  Carry water bottles   can save time and money. Drinking water available in few places for refilling your water bottles.  Avoid the photo with Mickey Mouse at entrance   Mickey will be available at various places during day. Saw lots of people wasting time for the photo   where I waiting for 2 minutes to get the photo near Grizzle Gulch attraction.  If you see long queue for any attraction, take fast track pass and come back later.",4
"Had a great time in Disneyland, we arrived early at 1030am and there are already a crowd. Lots of coach buses and if you are taking a cab the drop off point is a 10 15min to the entrance of Disneyland. It   s been to take the MTR into Disneyland. It   s right in front of the entrance. We spent 8 hours, going on the rides and enjoying the shows, Lion King, Moana, Winnie the Poo, etc. ",4
"If you plan to watch the parade, do make sure you grab good position at main street, especially the straight lane.   Else you might missed some part of it.   Do check t&c if you book online, especially meal coupon, you got to redeem at entrance.",4
"Very well organised place, good fun to spend a day with kids. If you plan well, can enjoy all the shows in a day's trip. However, timings for meeting various characters should be increased, especially if the crowds are large.",4
"We took a 2 day ticket as we were not sure with one day it can all be covered. The first day, we reached by 10 AM and being a weekday it was not very crowded. Its Halloween time and the place had parades and decorations for Halloween. Started with start trek and iron man rides and it was good. Remember, these rides are not as thrilling as the Universal studio and intended for young children (this is Disney!) Then proceeded to the shows and realized that shows get full if you dodon't reach early. The Moana show had very little seating and the security staff especially one male was kind of rude to people who were walking around. I guess they need to remember that they are not police and kids come with a lot of hope to see this. Not all staff are very fluent in English and when they speak in English they sound rather rude. (Dodon't stand here, I DOdon't know, Move away! etc are the words you hear). Some of them really need a lesson on being 'polite while being assertive'.The food options as written by many others are disappointing for people who do not eat pork and beef, there are very few chicken options. We tried the Asian cuisine restaurants and they are very average when it comes to quality of food. For vegetarians, it's a day of fasting!! (kidding, but it is almost true).If you book from Disney site, you get $15 x2 coupons. The main street store refused to take more than one coupon for a transaction, I argued and they called the manager who confirmed the rule!   one coupon per transaction. But to my surprise on the second day of my visit another store inside (star trek or the fantasy land one) accepted 2 coupons on my wife's ticket. Surprising. Again I think its English language proficiency that is the culprit. Unpleasant experience.The parades were excellent, especially the 8 PM Halloween parade. Shows were also really good and I guess more than rides these are the things you shoulddon't miss while in Disneyland.The second day was a Saturday and we could clearly see the difference in the crowd. It was crowded from 10 AM itself. We had only a few stuff pending and finished everything by lunchtime. Overall, it was a 1 and a half day visit and in my opinion, if you are not so particular about missing out a couple of rides you can cover this park in 1 Day itself   try to visit on a weekday.  MTR is connected to the park and transportation to the city is very easy.   There was no free Wi FI  The HongKong Disneyland app on Android can give you details of the shows. It just keeps crashing often on my Samsung phone but for a day it's manageable.  No food or drink allowed to be carried inside, Its mentioned everywhere but I still saw people getting caught in the security and wasting time in disposing off.  Many rides and attractions can be closed for public on a certain day due to 'private' events, details are updated on daily basis on the website and app. Check beforehand and plan.  You should be going at least 20 mins early for the shows, they get filled up fast.",4
Disneyland Hong Kong is small compared to other Disneyland we visited. When we visited it wasdon't that clean. Leaves from the trees are scattered in the alley. The pavement construction was not sophisticated too. The pros is that you can roam the entire Disneyland in one day for it wasdon't that big.,4
Compared to Disneyland In California this Park is smaller but in saying this it is still a memorable and enjoying experience. The only complaint we had was that it rained most of the day but it diddon't detract from the great time we had,4
"I love Disney. I can say that I am Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse biggest fan. But I still cadon't get the idea of spending 2 3 days of your holidays in Disneyland. For that reason, I think the size of the area of HK Disneyland is perfect. It might be slightly smaller than other Disneylands, but for some people who does not want to spend their times in Disneyland (just like me), this place is great. I came to this place in June, when it was 32degrees celsius in HK. If I have to spend my whole day in Disneyland under the crazy sun of HK, I dodon't think I would make it. Lol. So it might be a good idea not to have a bigger area of Disneyland in 2 seasonal countries such as HK. Furthermore, you still can have all of the favourite rides and attractions. So, overall...i give it 4 stars. Highly recommended if you want to have Disneyland experience but unwilling to spend more than 1 day trip.",4
"Best get in early as possible though, crowd & queueslow in the morning an as the day progresses obviously the queue time extends.I would start at Tomorrow Land and work your way around the park in a anti clockwise direction as I believe the rides are better and if you run out of time you havedon't missed out on too much. Take something to eat in a back pack if with a young family as eating at the park is very expensive. All in all a great day with good family memories forever.",4
This is my first Disneyland trip and it was definitely a memorable one. The crowd wasdon't as bad as been told. I was able to enjoy all rides in 1 day!Unfortunately Halloweentown & River View Cafe was closed when I was there.Villains Night Out during the closing was entertaining.,4
All you would expect from a Disney site. The queues were short on the day which meant that we saw  rode most attractions in one day. The reason for not giving 5 stars is that an area of the park was to close at 7pm but two of the attractions closed just after 5pm so we could not visit,4
"While not nearly as robust as it   s Japanese, French and American counterparts, Hong Kong Disneyland has its charms. The number one perk: the crowds. I have never seen crowds so light at a Disney park. Nearly all rides were walk on the entire day     even the fantastic Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Minecars and Hyperspace Mountain. The downside to the low crowds: many rides, shops and food vendors all had off hours (with some of the latter not opening at all). But the food we did have was great, the people were friendly and it was actually kind of nice not to have to rush through the relatively small park. Worth a one day visit for the casual Disney park fan; two days only for the fanatics. (Bonus tip: check out Mickey and the Wondrous Book, a fun and impressively produced musical stage show.)",4
We loved the experience and thought the rides were excellent. We stayed at Hotel Disneyland which I would highly recommend.Try to come in winter as the heat was almost unbearable during the middle of the day especially with 45 min queues due to Golden Week. It would be wonderful to see the park open until 10 or 11pm so that the rides could be enjoyed outside of the heat. We didn   t want to leave at 8pm!,4
"This is the 5th time we visited Hong Kong Disneyland!The iron man 4D ride is great! The star war mountain ride was a bit scary for my youngest child .. he is 6 years old, he was a bit scared during the ride , but my 7 years old love it and did it twice The food was great ! Both my dad and I had the laksa which was at high quality ! My kids were having the hainan chicken , they enjoyed it a lot ! We got the pass to get into the Halloween town which was quite fun! Again may be too scary for young kids as my son cried after visiting The fantasy land is very suitable for young kids . We tried the teacup and dumble and saw the mickey mouses orchestra 4d movie which was the highlight for the kids !However we had difficulty to find Mickey and mini mouse and all the Disney character to take photos Overall we has a great time!",4
"Been there for Halloween. Theme park is a bit small with lots of tourists. So it's a bit crowded. Try to go on weekdays for better experience. Other than that, the rest of the experience was good.",4
"The wife absolutely loved this place, we spent the whole day there, we got the MTR from Tsim Tsa Tsui with ease. As you would expect, it was all set up to take your cash , but thats cool. plenty of things to do and a lot of areas to rest and chill ( you will need it ). I would recommend to stay visit so you get the show after sundown, the kids will love it and you will score massive points with the kids overall. Have fun!",4
"Lovely place, I would recommend, my 17 yr old daughter loved it, I thought it was a better suited to the younger age group. Disneyland USA i thought is better.",4
"My partner and I love Disney so we were always going to go to Disneyland Hong Kong when we saw there was one. In the last few years, we have checked out LA and Paris versions together. The park was great, alot better than expected and a nice size, meaning you could get around all the attractions if you spent the whole day there. The rides were longer than some of the other parks we have visited recently. Our only drawback, came from the shows on offer. The Lion King show was a spectacle to watch, with it being all singing and dancing, however, the songs didn   t sound the same, with varying notes used by the performers. We also went to the Moana show, expecting to see and hear some of the great music, but this time there was no music at all involved. Maybe it is hard to find performers at the right ability, but it is a slight area of improvement, if I was being picky. Overall, it was a great day out and I would highly recommend it, Tip   It   s obviously very hot, so make sure you take lots of water with you, as it   s fairly expensive in the park. Tip   We went on a Tuesday, hoping it would be quiet but was very busy, possibly as it was the day after China Day, so try go on a slower day to get around everything. ",4
It is small but nice generally.   There are many programmes and shows planned with schedule.   The firework is amazing.,4
Each Disney park has it's uniqueness. Get there early to buy your tickets and line up. Catch MTR to Sunny Bay and change trains to the Disneyland resort line. It's the heat that exhausts you so take plenty of sun protection and pop into the shops to cool down. I dodon't recommend taking toddlers to any theme parks as there is very little for them to do and it is a realy long day. The staff are friendly and most speak English. ,4
"Huge park with lots of attractions. Have to plan your visit beforehand via their website in order to maximise your time there. Lots of airconditioned food options too, but is usually crowded due to the hot weather outside.",4
we had a two day pass booked through the disney web site it is a small disney park but lots of fun.  We had dinner at the cafe which was very nice but a little expencive.,4
"This Disneyland is much smaller and therefore, more crowded than the one in California, USA. The best rides in the park are Grizzly Gulch and HyperSpace Mountain. Almost everything else is geared toward very young children. Good visit, but not 5 stars.",4
"I was in disneyland HK in April 2018. I bought tickets online for 5 persons, whether tickets were lunch & dinner included. It was a rainy day, so we prepared also for rain coat and umbrella. Unfortunately one of the iconic palace was under renovation and temporarely closed. Lunch & dinner vouchers are only capable for some selected restourants, if you plan to whole day in disneyland, buying ticket with lunch and dinner included is still cheapest way.",4
We felt like kids! First experience at a Disney. It truly is magical. Everything is themed! From the toys to the food! Was disappointed about the castle still being under renovation. Also take note of the times to get your picture taken with the various characters around the park. We were too late to get our Mickey and Minnie picture. The food voucher was well worth it. Food portion was large. Drinks are expensive but you must stay well hydrated for the amount of walking that is done. We did not use the fast pass as the park was not very busy. The shops are amazing and have the cutest items to purchase. Had to control ourselves! The parade at night was so much fun. We wish we had stayed over for a night in the resort to complete the park but overall it was an amazing experience!,4
Very hood park. Nothing to signal. It was a good moment of fun. Greetings for france. I recommand this park,4
"Caught the MRT out to Disneyland from Kowloon. That was the first great part of a enjoyable day. Who would have thought there would be a train with Mickey Mouse head shaped windows? Cool!It   s a reasonable walk from the terminal to the actual entrance, but lots of things to look at (including of course lots of options to take your money!).The actual Park itself is very good. The various    lands    clean and slick, though staff in many are pretty slow to make things happen. Rides including roller coasters are fun and there is plenty for every age or level of    adventure    tolerance. Integration of Star Wars and Marvel themes are good, as is Toy Story Park area and Grizzly Gulch. Have to say that after a day I was theme parked out, but I can see that people that love Disney or theme parks could get far more out of it than me and over a couple of days. Certainly worth visiting if in Honk Kong. ",4
Hong Kong Disneyland is amazing. We took the MTR from Kowloon to HK Disneyland and the trains are adorable. The Mickey Mouse windows and then the various statues of Disney characters were so fun to see. We arrived before the park opened and got to watch a family open the park. This family the mom was cutely dressed and the kids were in different Halloween costumes and they were picked to open up Disney. It was SO adorable. Right now Disneyland is decorated all for Halloween and there is an area for the Villians to be out and planning. The music is a variety of Halloween music. Mickey and Minnie mouse were dressed for Halloween. Here is my opinion....HK Disneyland is a great place to go. If you want to go on the rides as long as you are going during a peak time (which I'm not sure when that would be    we went during the Moon Festival) but for most rides we waited no more than 20 minutes. However meeting the characters could ranges from waiting for 5 minutes or you could be waiting for over an 1 hour. Food    if you are okay with not air conditioner you could grab your food and eat outside on the tables outside the restaurant.,4
"Travel by train is easiest and cutest way to get to Disneyland as the train carriages and railway station are really worth seeing. We purchased entry tickets, available just for the day, from our hotel concierge. There is a lot of fairly flat walking to do and we started with the train within Disneyland to orientate ourselves. Ensure you have a hat and sunscreen in warm weather. Of course it is immaculately clean in every aspect. Renovations and extensions were underway so when finished will be really great.",4
"Disney is always the magical kingdom, and after numerous visits, I   m still in love with touring around the park enjoying the shows and rides. Staff are a little less friendly than those of Disneyland Tokyo, but still helpful. The waiting time for rides are shorter than expected, probably because it was a weekday (but public holiday) and not during summer holidays. I don   t recommend going during summer holidays because: 1. the weather is too hot and humid for most people; 2. the queues are probably crazy long. ",4
"This may be the most beautiful of the Disneylands I've visited (LA, Orlando, Shanghai and Hong Kong) but it has the least to offer of them. We stayed and I recommend staying in the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel and were given paper FASTPASSes we could use on Ironman Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch roller coaster, and Mickey's PhilharMagic (which we diddon't see as we have seen it numerous times in WDW). You get a certain number of FP for each person per night you stay based on your level of room. We stayed in a Kingdom Club Room and received 4 passes per night per person so we had 16 passes as we stayed four nights for 5 attractions. I threw some away and gave some away because it was simply too many for such a small park to even want to ride those same five attractions that many times! But I highly recommend this for at least one night. Staying in the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel also gets you into Mickey and the Wondrous Book's first show in first which we did. We were still able to get a FASTPASS for Winnie the Pooh in the park as well and used a VIP tour to do all the rest of the rides skipping the line and for a private viewing area of the nighttime parade (which we diddon't need as it wasdon't crowded compared to US park standards even in July and we watched the parade from the upstairs of the RR station on Main Street with no one around us and a superb view). We were able to ride things multiples times and see all shows we dodon't have in our American parks. We had a great time but there is far less to do here and it does not require more than a day if you plan correctly. They dodon't have a lot of newer amazing attractions like Shanghai did and it was extremely hot in July so I'm only giving it four stars.",4
"Visited here 09 20. It was a very humid day! We ducked into some of the shops to cool off. It was a week day so not very crowded. They recovered from the typhoon rather quickly. Most everything was open and you would never know the typhoon passed through here. The Ironman Experience is cheesy. It was just a photo opportunity with person in Ironman costume who used pre recorded voice. The Moana: A Homecoming Celebration is outdoors in a half covered venue. Also cheesy, but the kids seemed to like it. The Moana character sorta looked like Moana. The ladies might want to watch the movie again to do hula correctly. It was funny to see one of the drummers with a body suit to make him look tanned with Maori tattoos.The parade had the normal characters Toy Story, Lilo & Stitch, etc. Seemed shorter than the American version.Overall, this little Disney is entertaining for the children and maybe teenagers. We spent a total of 3 hours there.",4
"We had a great time at this park. Despite being mostly geared towards younger children compared to other Disney resorts, it   s still Disney...high quality experience, decent food options (even for dietary restrictions), and some really fun rides. The ambiance of Disney always makes it worth it in my opinion! ",4
"The day we visited Hong Kong Disneyland it was warm and the weather was fine to start off. That changed and then it rained for the rest of the day. We enjoyed Disneyland but found lots of areas were closed because of the weather. There were not many places to eat at, I think most people grabbed tables to get shelter out of the weather. That made it difficult for anyone wanting to eat a meal at a table. It was quite easy to get on the rides as most people disappeared when the rain set in. Tickets are expensive but if you are a child at heart it's worth going to.",4
"It has always been my dream to visit Disneyland. Hong Kong is the nearest one so I really saved to go there. Unfortunately, the day when we went there, it was raining so we have to buy raincoats. Raincoats cost 70HKD. But the rain did not stop us from enjoying what Disneyland has to offer. I could say that one day is not enough to try all the rides and attractions that this park has. But the best part for me are the shows we watched   Feast of the Lion King, Mickey's Philharmonic Theater and Storybook. It was like going back to my childhood days. So nostalgic, specially for a Disney fan like me. The parade was the main highlight for me which I totally enjoyed. One of the things I was disappointed about is that there were no fireworks because Sleeping Beauty castle was closed for renovation. I also did not get to see as much Disney characters, maybe because it was raining? Lastly, the food is pricey and in small portions too. But overall, it was a memorable and fun visit!",4
"My family enjoyed our trip in Disney HK. It is really the happiest place. As an adult it reminds me of my childhood days. There is one staff who is very accommodating, he is the guard standing in the entrance near the jungle river, although I forgot to take note of his name. We had our lunch in Starliner, unfortunately my family did not enjoy the food. I would recommend the Royal Banquet Hall where we enjoyed our dinner. A variety of foods to choose from and the serving was very satisfying. My son enjoyed the hyperspace mountain. While I enjoyed the jungle river a lot. Your family will surely enjoy the tour in Disney HK.",4
"Hong Kong Disneyland is small compared to the others, it has more resturants than rides, BUT the queues are much shorter   it has all of the MUST DO Disney stuff   unfortunately the magic castle was closed for refurbishment while we were there   We had 1 full day from open to Fireworks and fitted everything in comfortably.",4
"Definitely a must to visit once in a lifetime. Will definitely look forward to go back again, it is sad that the Castle is closed for renovation and the fireworks are no longer part of their lineup. But thanks to the staff, especially the ones in the Lilo and Stitch Costumes for being so welcoming and fun. The rides are also very fun and there wasdon't an absurd amount of waiting time compared to other theme parks of similar scale.Thank you Disneyland Hong Kong!",4
The title sums it up really ... we managed to do the whole park in a day (including going on all rides and watching both the daytime and evening parades (festival of lights ?).  Typical Disney atmosphere and loved it but it is very small.,4
Our kids are now teenagers but we all still had a great day. If you have smaller kids I think it is tailored for them really well. A handful of good rides for adults makes it enjoyable. Don   t expect many thrill seeking rides here. The layout of the park and the themed detail that goes into the attraction is fantastic. A one day pass is all that is needed to get around to all the attractions. Only disappointment was the lack of food stalls and the lack of variety. Many stalls were closed. Kids had hotdogs which did not seem fresh. The 1.30pm parade was fantastic and a must see for all ages. ,4
"My kids truly enjoyed Disneyland HK, only disappointed that Sleeping Beauty Castle was closed down due to renovation.As for us Muslims, we had options of Halal Food at The Explorers    Cafe and also a little prayer room located next to the cafe.My boys enjoyed the Ironman rides at Tomorrowland. Totally worth a visit, hope they can improve Free Wifi network..",4
"Quintessential Disney. We were unsure of what to expect, but being Disney, how bad could it be? We have been to Orlando many many times and its been done to death. This park is much smaller and rides are similar, maybe with a different name, but similar to whats in Orlando. One big difference was Toy Story land, which reminded me of Hollywood Studios. These rides we haddon't seen before and they were super fun, even for an 11 and 13 year old. The lines in August were what you'd expect, most 45 minutes  if not more. We stayed at Disney property and were given what was basically fast passes for some of the rides. All of the rides diddon't accept this pass, but the ones that did, we just went on the same 5 rides or so twice.",4
"Went on a Thursday and literally diddon't have to wait for any rides. The only negatives are no Haunted House, Pirates of the Caribbean, Matterhorn :( Yet, air conditions was working in full force inside all of the attractions.",4
Love the parade and all the adventures   The trolley mine coaster was super fun  Had a good buffet at Mickey Mouse restaurant and it was awesome     ,4
HK Disneyland visit is always a wonderful experience if you have kids. We had a nice time since we had half a day of free time during our stay. Luckily it was not crowded so getting into rides etc. was easy.,4
This is my second time here. Loved this place and the atmosphere. Too bad the Fantasyland was closed for renovation. Staff was extremely helpful. Toilets can be found everywhere. And it's clean. Merch were very expensive though.,4
"We went with our 2 year old and found HK Disneyland was great. We wished that we had booked a night at their hotel (despite it costing more than our hotel back in Sai Yin Pun). It would have meant that we could spend more time at Disneyland and get to stay for the fireworks at night. We went on a relatively quiet day, but the lines were still too long to bother getting photos with the characters that made random appearances throughout the day. Lines were good for the rides that were age appropriate for our 2 year old and we still managed to spend the whole day there, but not see everything. If we had another opportunity to go back, we would invest the few extra dollars to stay at the Disneyland hotel and therefore spend more time there. Cost is to be expected going to a theme park, and they had a lot of Chinese food available for lunch. Either that or expensive Mickey Mouse shaped waffles. The train that takes you to Disneyland from Sunny Bay was Disney themed and pretty cool. We actually went several years ago, not in March 2018, but was worth the belated review.",4
"The park was not big, you can complete it in a day. Do bring an umbrella in case of rain during the rainy season. What really turns me off is the service at some of the cashier. They seems to want you to get out as soon as possible. ",4
A nice place to visit with the family especially if they are early teens or younger. We got a very good deal through Air Asia with 20% off which made it even better. It is better to buy the meal deal from the site as that is economical compared to buying it individually provided of course if you are going to use for both lunch and dinner. Only issue is if it rains or signs of inclement weather then a lot of rides are stopped which could spoil your day and crowding at all indoor rides,4
"We were lucky enough to catch Hong Kong Disneyland on a rainy August day, so it wasdon't as hot or as crowded as I hear it gets. It's a small park and doesdon't have a lot of rides but we enjoyed our day there. The most beautiful part was Adventure land which was large with amazing trees and landscaping. There are only 3 FastPass rides: Winnie the Pooh, Hyperspace Mountain, and IronMan. The Grizzly ride was probably our favorite. Definitely go early because most people seem to come around 2:00. And be warned that Toy Story land has no shade.",4
Was a pretty good day. Actually half day. We got a few rides in and then it poured rain and started to storm. We were completely drenched but managed to have an alright day all the same. We got there early which was good to avoid some of the building crowd.,4
"Third time in HK Disneyland. We had a two day ticket this time. The first day was there from 1000 2000, five items enjoyed. We wanted to watch Mickey and the wondrous book, for two sessions we missed the opportunity. The staff told us that if we wait there 45 minutes before the session, we can definitely get into the 1000 seats. So going there last minute doesn   t help.We have priority pass for Festive of the lion king, moreover unless you are there 30 min before, the pass will not be helpful.At heavy rain times, most rides continue, it might worth getting a rain coat and keep going.We had priority admission for the Iron Man experience, but it is expected to be 102cm for this.",4
I strongly advise people to take the 2 day pass if with kids. mostly all rides have long waiting hours even on weekdays. if you are staying at any of Disneys hotel you will also get a fast pass for every night so dont miss this opportunity ,4
"Hong Kong Disneyland it is fun. We went there without kids, but yet being an adult you will surely enjoy the experience. The negative side, the queuing and the excesive cost of food and drinks inside the park. However, worths the visit.",4
"This theme park suits the kids very well. However, I was clueless as to why this park had a 2 days pass that sells. It can be completed well within 1 day as I feel that unless you will feel obligated to visit each n every attraction, there is no need to spend 2 days here. Otherwise, the place is beautiful, food is great, costly of course. The 4D effect in theatre experience of Iron Man was well created. But the post sunset fireworks were an absolute visual delight and you need to stay back till 7:30 pm to make your visit feel complete. Easy to commute to Disneyland by MTR: East Tsim Sha Tsui         Nam Cheong         Sunny Bay         Disneyland. Change lines at the above mentioned stations and you shud be in Disneyland in 40 mins from Tsim Sha Tsui. ",4
"I am barely qualified to gauge the quality of this or any other Disneyland: I dodon't have kids, and have not been to a Disney theme park since the 1980s. But Ladyfriend and I decided not long after we moved here to spend the weekend on Lantau, and so here we are. And to be frank, I enjoyed HK Disneyland. It's really small, as I am sure other reviewers have mentioned, which means that it's doable in two or three hours (maybe longer if you have kids?), and although it is missing (m)any of the thrill rides that other Disney properties feature (you'll have to go to Ocean Park for that...), it's a nice way to spend an afternoon.I'm not going to explain what Disneyland is. But I do have some tips.   Go on a weekday. I have never been on a weekend, but am sure it gets crowded. We diddon't hit a single line on a Tuesday  They dodon't start serving booze until early evening. I dodon't know what my advice is on this front other than maybe  go later,  but I will say a propos of nothing that there is very little stopping one from hitting the 7 11 beforehand and bringing some roadies.  Lunch options are few, so same as above, although once you're in it's definitely not as expensive as other Disney parks in terms of food. There's a multinational, cafeteria style restaurant that is not great, but certainly gets the job done is doesdon't break the bank.Note: I shoulddon't have to even write this, but if you are visiting HK and looking for an  authentic  HK experience, do NOT go to Disneyland. Stick to the main island and to Kowloon, where there are a million awesome things to do and see. But if you have kids, or like rides, or need to check this Disney experience off of your bucket list, or have some sort of personal Disney thing such that you are all but mandated by your therapist or something to spend as much time as possible in the happiest place on earth, I wodon't try to dissuade you. Again, it's small enough that you can spend the morning doing actual HK stuff, and then spend the afternoon here, or vice versa. It's also pretty close to the action; if you're taking public, expect about a 90 minute ride from Central, but the nice thing is that Disneyland has a dedicated MTR line, complete with Mickey's head shaped windows and straps.Finally, here are the rides you want to go on, at least as an adult, as agreed upon by Ladyfriend and myself:1. Hyperspace Mountain (a very small scale Star Wars themed ride that piggy backs on the Space Mountain concept). It's less scary than an actual roller coaster, but there are some stomach drops. If I were big brothering a kid who was very frightened of roller coasters, I would make him go on this to build his confidence. There are a couple of cool SW tie ins as well.2. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. It's all there in the name, and it's a fun little ride.3. RC Racer. This is their version of the big, swinging pirate ship ride that many of us grew up with. Stomach drops galore.4. Toy Soldier Parachute Drop. Your bench seat is hoisted way up high (affording one of the best views all day), and then... you drop. 5. Iron Man Experience. This is a VR experience that is several notches above seeing an action film in 4DX. It's OK for adults, but I suspect elementary aged kids would love it.",4
have never thought would be going to disneyland. location away from the city which is good. nicec to have up to date attraction like iron man. beautiful fireworks at night,4
"Great place to visit for one or two entire days. Take water from home, drinks are really expensive inside the Park.",4
"Really nice theme park, with short waiting times. The ride I would recommend the most, is the phantom manor, which is unique to Hong Kong Disneyland.",4
Best place ever. Full of so many thinks to do. A full day is exhausting and so many things to do and see. The food is expensive there and very average. Ride attendants polite and smile. Need much more English speaking staff. Very clean. Transport system is fantastic. It's a must see on your holiday itinerary!,4
"You'll need stamina and patience but this is a good place to spend 10  hours with your kids, there are plenty of great attractions and everything is dodon't to a high quality. however like all Disneylands, wait times can be long   especially to meet get photo with characters... allow at least 30 min per character so get your kids to choose carefully otherwise you'll pay a fortune to spend the day getting a few photos. Best Things:1. Rides and attractions are great, as are shows like Lion King. 2. Everything is clean and well maintained.3. Its so easy to get to and from with the MTR (train) or taxisWorst Things:1. Food is very expensive and wait times can be very long (eg 30  minutes for McDonalds!) for pretty basic fare. 2. Wait times for photos with Disney characters are very long, some active 'people management' should be employed to make it 15 seconds per photo opportunity then move on! 3. Guest Relations are almost useless   dont expect help or understanding from them and they dodon't care if your kids are howling and your are distressed.",4
"Having a friend coming back to HK from the UK, we picked a day to visit the HK Disneyland. The theme park is always offering visitors a joyful atmosphere, making them feel like being in a magical fairyland. Staff here were passionate with their job, offering memorable experiences for travelers. However, the refurbishment of the Castle as well as the abandonment of the Buzz and Lightyear game made the visit a little repentant. Still, we had a great day here.",4
"It   s Disney, so mostly you will know what to expect.  But if you have been to Florida you should know that this park doesn   t have the same flawless finish, the attention to detail is a little lacking (you may see people emptying bins etc, things...More",4

"Travelled earlier this year in April.Very smooth getting to Hong Kong Disney by the MTR. Traveling with 3 young kids was fairly easy and smooth.Having visited most of the Disney parks we had quite high expectations for this park, and they were met. As soon as you board the Disney train from sunny bay station you can see and feel that there was no expenses spared. We visited on a Saturday and it was busy but not overcrowded.At the time not all the rides open and there were a few parts under construction or renovation including the main castle.Average wait time for the characters was about 1hr. Average queue time for kids rides was about 30mins.We opted for the 3 in 1 meal pass which worked out best for us.Our lunch meal was at royal banquet hall which was surprisingly very good, considering it was theme park food. And dinner was at Clopin's Festival of Foods, and this was amazing! Coming from Stockholm, I have to admit that the food we got from this restaurant was better than anything I   ve had in sweden. (Please check pics)Whether you visit Hong Kong disney with kids or not it is worth a visit! Who doesn   t like a day at a theme park? ",4
"Disneyland Hong Kong was beautiful! My husband and I spent a day there and thoroughly enjoyed it. The center of the park was having renovations done which was disappointing but all the other attractions were up and running. The park was well organised, clean, easy to navigate and if you get there early you beat the lines and the heat.",4
"Tip buy the discounted ticket on Klook. We spent less than a day at the park, and had plenty of time to do everything. Most of the lines were not long. Be aware that the food options are expensive, and not so good, and there is lots of walking to get to the park.",4
"We found that even in the wet, Disney was fun. There was enough shelter in most places that you diddon't get soaked but I would bring a brolly. We diddon't do any shows (not the thing for Mr 4.5) but he loved the Paint the Night Parade. If you can take a break in the afternoon (when its very hot) and come back in the early evening, I would   otherwise its a very long day for little ones. MTR is very convenient.",4
"getting there is so simple with the train, & for seniors the price to go to Disneyland is terrific..a cheap day out!",4
"This Disney Park is smaller than the others around the world, but it   s still a lot of fun! Best food I   ve ever eaten in a theme park too!",4
Definitely kids will enjoy to the core but this adults also can rock on for 1 full day. For catching the parade and other Theatre shows just keep an eye on the timing and venue in the app.. 1 full day is required to cover all 7 segments ... ,4
"We, my companion and I, he was 72 at the time did a couple of rides, we stood in line for hours but laughed like kids. It was very humid though.",4
"Although being the smallest of the Disney Parks, the attention to detail and great customer service is at the top of the list. The waiting period in line for the major attractions weredon't to long. The atmosphere and layout of the resort are well thought out. The only downside was that their were not that many thrill rides in the park.",4
"Went here with my whole family (17 of us), we took MTR to reach this place, stop in Sunny Bay station and change the train to Disneyland Resort (special white train with mickey windows and disney figurine inside the train). the weather was good when we get there but then there was a lil rain but we enjoyed it, we bought disney raincoat from the store nearby then continue our adventure. Favorite ride   Big Grizzly Mountain (3 times with my bro!). We had lunch at Starliner dinner (good food, affordable price). We spent a full day here and it was so much fun!",4
"We took the bus from Shenzhen to get there (give yourself time   the trip can take a while). We were there in December, so the crowds weredon't too bad. Best rides to go on: Hyperspace Mountain (like Space Mountain in the US, but Star Wars themed), Mystic Manor (the Hong Kong answer to the Haunted Mansion), and Big Grizzly Mountain   truly the best surprise of the three! One pet peeve: as a US citizen there, I was sad that all the popcorn was sweet rather than salty. I would've loved some butter and salt popcorn while I was there.",4
An amazing Disneyland to visit and great experience for all ages. So many fun rides and activities. You can see the whole park easily in 1 day. We spent about 5 hrs there. Try the Mickey Mouse waffles on Main street!,4
"Having traveled to all the Disney parks in the world, I would have to say this was the smallest. The castle (which is supposed to be removed soon) was actually smaller than the original park in Anaheim CA. Toy Story land was pretty cool but that's all it really had going for it. Favorite ride   Mystic Manor (their version of Haunted Mansion). You can absolutely do this park in 1 day (especially in the fall).",4
"A small version of Orlando with subtle Asian influences that are necessary,  balanced, subtle, and work well with a mostly American theme park experience.",4
"Perhaps it was my timing but HK Disneyland was missing something this time around. Lots of new and current characters abound but the land area hasdon't increased to accommodate the extra additions. Many of the old favorites were missing this time   or perhaps they are no longer there! There does not appear to be any  Crowd control  they just kept arriving and being allowed entry   surely there is, or should be, a maximum limit! The most famous structure, well, Disney one that it, is the Castle. Once you could walk thru, into or around but not on my day. The lower 40% or so was covered up. A pic of the upper portion was still quite good and would give the littlies a thrill. Refreshments etc quite fairly priced.",4
"I   m not one for Disney theme parks, and the price seems a bit high in my opinion, but if you   re in the area with kids, it   s perfectly respectable amusement park with a decent bit of rides, especially for the younger set. If you   re in East Asia and can   t make it to the bigger parks, this is a perfectly acceptable alternative.",4
"Nice parade show, nice ride, but you will need to wait for at least 40 minutes until you can get single ride. Need to spare the whole day for this place. Anyway, its place for both adult and children to visit.",4
A good theme park..unfortunately it rained very heavily when we were there. We were all wet inspite having purchased their raincoat cos there were lots of open areas.... Nevertheless it was a good experience.,4
Already been to Disneyland 5 times and it's always a nice day in family. This last time we've stayed at one of the three hotels in their resort and it was really fun.We stayed in Disney's Hollywood Hotel and their restaurant with buffet for dinner was amazing.,4
This is a smaller disneyland which doesdon't have all the draw cards of the larger resorts like tokyo or USA. The cost is expensive for what's here priced at $124 new zealand. Due to the heat it would be better to visit from 2pm until closing as this would give you time to enjoy the park and see the parades. Do take your own food and drink as food here is expensive. The waiting time for most rides can be up to an hour but you might get lucky. Get a fast past to avoid the lines. Take the orange train line to get there and change for the Disney line at sunny bay as shown on the map.,4
"Although it was scorching hot when we visited, we enjoyed our visit. It is a lot smaller than Disneyland Anaheim and they close super early! But, who doesdon't like Disneyland?",4
"This place is just oh so adorable! The visitors make it just as cute with all of the Mickey and Minnie paraphernalia. It's one to tick off your bucket list, although I am sure the ones in USA and Paris are better. Still, do it I smiled so much here.",4
"Cool MTR train to Disney. Check Klook app for cheaper tickets. Download the Disney Hong Kong app to your phone and have it handy before arriving at the theme park. Sunday visit   Security bag check started around 9am. Entry into the theme park around 9:30am. Only stores on Main Street were open between 9:30am to 10:00am. Rides in Fantasyland opened at 10:00am. Tomorrowland and Grizzly Gulch opened close to 10:30am.Only three fast pass options available   (1) Winnie the Pooh ride; (2) Hyperspace Mountain; and (3) Ironman Experience.Must see do   (1) Lion King show (though my daughter says it   s not much different from the Orlando Animal Kingdom version); (2) Mystic Manor (specific to HK Disney); (3) Hyperspace Mountain Big Grizzly Mine Cart Ironman Experience (Stan Lee cameo in video) and (4) Disney Main Street 8:30pm activity.Grizzly Mine Cart was closed by 7:15pm?!?My favorite restaurant   The Explorer   s Club restaurant for its Hainan Chicken Rice. Food is expensive! Approximately $20 per person per meal. Ice cream in freshly made waffle cones for 40HKD (45HKD for a double scoop) hit the spot after the Small World ride. Cash only (1HKD:1RMB).The castle was surprisingly really small and is currently undergoing construction. Only one day needed for Disney Hong Kong. My daughter prefers Disney Hong Kong over Disney Shanghai because there were less people shoving. She said the rides were better in Shanghai,...",4
Visited with friends and only planned to stay a couple of hours but spent the whole day Took the train which was cute and had the best day on the rides early to beat the ques. Only small Disneyland perfect for young families. Loved it.,4
"I've been to most of the Disney parks and this one is by far and way the smallest of them. It's quite easy to do most of the park in the morning if you get their early, after an 1.5hr we had done most of the main rides. Entry seems to be a very muddled affair with none of the gates moving fast, however when you are in everything works well.They open the different lands at different times which seems very strange. The Mystic Manor is definitely well worth going into.The park has the magic of the Disney parks and is well worth going to. I really am at a loss why you would need 2 days there, but I guess if you have small children it takes a longer to get from place to place.Plenty of different food options to choose from with a good mix of Asian and Western to choose from (prices are Hong Kong Prices so expensive).The parades get very crowded so well worth picking a good spot in the shade before it starts.",4
"Pretty small and manageable  you can easily hit all the highlights within the first three or four hours of the park opening (assuming you go at line drop and dodon't stop for breakfast character meets etc). The park has a lot of repackaged rides areas from Disneyworld and Anaheim Disneyland, which was fine but nothing new. The best rides that are relatively novel to Hong Kong are Iron Man and Mystic Manor (the best, obviously). My favorite part of the whole park was actually the shows, which were really well done and blended Cantonese and English in a very accessible and interesting way. Definitely try to catch the Jedi Training  it was hilarious and great. The shows were the most identifiably  Hong Kong  part of the park, so they were really memorable for me, as a westerner. If you need an afternoon beer, River View Cafe has one beer on tap.",4
"A must do with teenagers. Smaller and less to see and do than Disneyland Anaheim, but on the other hand that means you will get a good spot for shows and parades, etc... Despite the size, we still got a 2 day ticket because DISNEY !!! Worth using the MTR to travel there as there   s a special Disney themed train   cute! (Just be aware, you rarely get a seat on packed MTR so will have to stand for your trip home after a long day on your feet).",4
"The kids had been looking forward to visiting Hong Kong Disneyland but we visited on a very hot day. We had pre booked and arrived on the Disney Train and exchanged our voucher for the tickets. The walk to the attractions was quite long but the kids really enjoyed themselves on the various rides and of course with popcorn and ice creams.Queues were really long so we tried to stay indoors and visited places like  It's a small world , although that had a very long queue and involved a lot of waiting before we could get a ride.This is the second Disneyland we have visited but due to the immense crowds and the hot weather the kids did not enjoy it as much as Tokyo Disneyland. If we visit a Disneyland again we will check the weather and definitely not go on a public holiday or weekend.Overall, a nice visit, especially at the Main Street Corner Cafe which had nice drinks and decent food.",4
"We enjoyed our visit to Disney Land, the parade, the shows (lion king is a must see) and all others..but just a little bit disappointed because they did not have firework show at that time. Cinderrella's castle is under contruction. But all in all our experience was pretty good.",4
I have been to Disneyland in different countries. The Hong Kong one is not very big neither has many rides specially for adults.However it   s atmosphere is very nice and it is more organized and less crowded comparing to other Disneyland around the world.Very nice to spend a day there walking and taking pics with Disney characters.,4
Compared to the USA parks this park is small and the rides are catered more for the younger visitor which is understandable.  But the park is very clean and enjoyable   must stay for the end parades.,4
Lovely and clean everyone is happy to serve you and wave hello etc... clean and the rides are great. Come in July the queues are short,4
"Although only 3 4 rides were good for adults, this is primary for the kids who are in 0 10 year age range. And they have more food stalls   restaurants than rides.",4
"We decided to visit Disneyland for the day whilst on our honeymoon in Hong Kong. Whilst there were a lack of thrill rides, queues compared to other Disneyland's weredon't that bad (30 mins max whereas you could be looking at 3 hours during peak time in other Disney's). The park was very clean and we were impressed by the food options offered, much better than the usual fayre (burgers, hot dogs, chicken nuggets etc). Mystic Manor was the highlight for us, a real gem. Space mountain is slow and disappointing compared to Paris, could do with updating. Mine train was a good surprise. All in all, we made the right decision to visit here over Ocean Park.",4
"Spent the day at Disneyland with my family. Rather small if you compare to Florida or California. Not to many people though, so it was nice. All people stand in line compared to the US, so that   s definitely a plus. Everyone has a smile on their faces. Worth spending a day at if you ask me!",4
"Although we were hot and uncomfortable most of the day, we all had a blast. My sister and I went with our young kids and we just had to be sure to keep ourselves hydrated and get into AC every so often to cool off. We went on a Friday and there was a crowd but we still managed to cover much of the park. I have been to Magic Kingdom Disney in Orlando and it took us 2 days. We felt satisfied with the HK Disney after one day because we had covered so much due to the lack of lines. The Lion King show was a highlight. The Moana show is a new feature but needs more seating as it was very crowded. Overall we had a great time and would recommend!",4
"We have been living in Hong Kong for two years now. We have wanted to take our 3 kids to Disney since we landed. We were finally able to do that while my sister was in town. I will start off by saying, I grew up on Disney World, so it will be really hard to top that. Still, they did a great job with the Disney here. We thoroughly enjoyed it. While it wasdon't close to Disney World, it was close to being there. They did a nice job with Tomorrowland. The show we saw was incredibly inclusive. It performed the songs in English. The dialogue was in Cantonese with subtitles on either side in English and Mandarin. Prices were Disney prices. Everything was pretty expensive, but that is the way Disney is. The parade at the end of the night was a lot of fun. Exiting the park was incredibly easy with the MTR stop right there. The kids especially loved the special MTR for the Disney Land. It is worth seeing, but if you've done Disney before, I would maybe suggest checking out Ocean Park. It is unique to Hong Kong and has pandas!!",4
If you have a company with child at heart.You will enjoy going here.But i dodon't recommend to visit on april or may.it is too hot.i suggest go on during feb or march.,4
"The Park was great, the family loved the experience however we really loved the shops and amazing variety in Disney items we could purchase. We probably spent more time in there than the actual park. The kids loved the air conditioned or fans in the waiting lines as it was a very warm day that we visited. The park copes well with a lot of park visitors and waiting time in lines for all rides were kept to a minimum.",4
Disney doesn   t disappoint but it   s not Florida! If you   re a huge Disney fan you will love this however the rides are more childish than Orlando so don   t get disappointed! Worth a visit!,4

"This place is quite good for your destination in HK with your family. It is easily to go there by MTR from any where in HK through by Sunny Bay Station.  The price is quite expensive, you can buy evoucher by Klook cheaper than you...More",4
"The park is quiet big,the rides and shows are very interesting and very well maintained .Unlike several theme parks in china you will find the maintenance of park facilities is top class .Families with very young children are recommneded to bring thier own stroller or you can also hire stroller at the park . You get theme park map at the ticket window and also at kiosks just after entering the ticket chekpoints .Take a few minutes to note the show times , Parade and fireworks Parade and fireworks show is not to be missed .People usually take good spots along the parad route well before the parade start time .Most popular rides and shows have the fast pass system so you can tag yourbtiket at the fast pass kiosk at each of those rides and return at the punched time so you will get to go through the fast pass queue which is shorter .A great place for day out with family",4
"but I really had fun in Disneyland!   Came here with my sister and a fellow solo  traveller I met at my hostel, and we all agreed that it was the highlight of our Hong Kong trip",4
"it can be exhausting to spend whole day here. Rides have long queues but shows like lion king is nice. Adventure zone Tomorrowland highly recommended to start with first. Jungle river cruise in adventure land is nice too. Most rides end by 6 pm...while parade happens at 8.45...a long wait. Parade earlier used to be proper walk of Mickey, Donald but now they mainly use LED floats which are not that interesting. We faced thunderstorm on our visit so many rides got cancelled & we got wet. Food is not widely available & is restricted. Must take cable car ride that takes you to a hill top with many rides n games there.To save time : buy an Express Pass, if you can afford",4
"Hong Kong Disneyland is able to maintain their service level, especially with the new attractions (Iron Man and Star Wars). Free fast pass is offered for several selected attractions. Slight negative experience on food quality served in one of the food stall inside Disneyland whereby the menu states that it is  duck breast meat  but it tasted very much like  luncheon meat  and you could not see the meat stripes that usually exist in meat.",4
"As part of my bucket list ,visiting All the Disney parks was on the list.As a Senior entrance was only $100HK. I have 2 Favourite rides Pirates and Small world. HK doesdon't have Pirates and Shanghai doesdon't have Small World.By going to both I was satisfied .. Having no Pirates is the only reason 4** instead of 5**. at HK . God value and totally a better experience than Shanghai.",4
"As a child, I have dreamed of going to Disneyland and when I got the chance to, I was somewhat, underwhelmed. It was smaller than expected, Ocean Park was way larger when it comes to the vastness of the park itself. It was also quiet and that's a good thing, I think. I only enjoyed the souvenir shops and will probably visit again if given a chance.",4
"The smallest of all the Disneys we   ve been to, but the flip side of this was that it was much quieter (we queued for a maximum of 15 minutes, most of the time able to get on rides in quick succession) and also quicker to get around (it   s not a trek from one side of the park to the other).Food and drink is reasonably priced overall. However, water at   3 a bottle was fairly steep.There was some renovation taking place at the laughably small castle which hampered some of the space in the park.Staff were all friendly and courteous throughout. An area for improvement would be the types of badge they give you in entry needing variety (other Disney parks have    just married   ,    Birthday    etc).Having been to an animation academy before at a different Disney, we were pleased that this was available here too. While the classes say they are only in Cantonese, don   t be put off as it   s easy to follow, great fun, and they do throw in a few English explanations along the way.Very easy to get there via HK metro   there   s a special Disney line which takes you the last part of the way. Overall a very good visit.",4
"Took our 2 year old boy to Hkg Disneyland for his birthday. Choosed Hkg as this was the nearest in terms of flight time from KL, was worried he wouldnt take to kindly to being strapped down to his seat, going was stressful but coming home was easier as he slept throughout his flight. One thing i discovered was in order to take loads of pix with Mickey and gang, best place is to dine in one of theyre restaurants where makes they make scheduled appearances, taking photos with Disney characters in Disneyland itself entails a long queue. Staying in Disney hotels was also a treat. Travelling to and from Disneyland and even to the city was easy as they had frequent free coaches. Going a week before the holidays, and on a weekday, queues for the rides were fast and short. Be prepared to spend though as the Disney Resort Hotel, all day tickets, foods and gift shop items are not cheap. All in all it was an enjoyable experience and my kid had a blast hugging and kissing Mickey and gang, not to mention mummy and daddy had a jolly good time to. For parents worrying abt strollers, they hv the Disney strollers. Dont forget to download the app as its quite informative, indicates kids rides suitability according to height and also general info like where to find what rides, shops and restaurants etc.",4
"Hong Kong Disneyland is a great day out for families, however would recommend not going there on an extremely hot day, which we did, very little shelter from sun unless you enter the souvenir shops of which there are plenty and as can be expected packed with shoppers. Even the shows di not have enough seating to watch it appeared to us as we only saw a few bench seats at the front. However still a good day out.",4
"It   s a good experience. Took the MTR and it   s convenient.   The shows are good. Loved the Lion king festival.  Wish there were more shaded areas to rest, as the HK weather is very humid, there should be more water spouts.  Overall a great experience.",4
Had a nice and crazy experience in Disneyland HK. Good for begginers on lunaparks and rollercoasters!,4
"Even in the heat we all had a fantastic day lasting 8 hours! We got some fast passes given to us by our hotel (Disney Explores Lodge) which came in handy as the crowds increased around lunch time. Loved all the rides we went on, staff all kind, food was average, just what you would expect. Brought out the kid in all of us.. ",4
"Check the weather before you go, if it   s raining, you won   t see many characters outside. The outdoor ride close, just indoor options available. A really pleasant surprise was on the 2nd day, the staff at the MTR told me the park may be closed due to the rains, while I bought the tickets. If you still decide to go, we did on both rainy days as we had a 2 day pass, take a rain coat  umbrella. Or pay HK $70 to buy one at the park.Lot of walking to do, plan your visit and what you want to do before you get there. This way you will finish off all that you want, before exhausting yourself and most importantly if you have kids. It can get really hot and humid!My little girl is a princess maniac and the experience of meeting Snow White, Elsa, Sophia, Tinker Bell, Moana was quite phenomenal. I loved the way the characters interact with kids making it a truly memorable experience. If you are looking for A particular character, make sure you check if they are on schedule the day you   re going. E.g. Elsa, we went on Tue and Fri and we could meet Elsa only on Fri. They have fixed timings, so planning will certainly help.The shows are good too, Lion King, Moana, etc. Plan 30 mins per show, minimum. The night parade is awesome, I see kids fascinated by the light show and characters.Food is good, lot of options available. If you have the 2 day pass, make sure you have the eTicket handy the 2nd day, even if you   ve registered with you finger print.Pretty easy to get there via MTR.We   ve been to the one in Paris, this one though smaller definitely packs a punch. With kids or not, you can complete in one day provided you get there early. Happy Mickeying!! :)",4
"So, it   s not to the caliber of the original but it is a nice park. Smaller than Anaheim Disney but with a smaller and quite reasonable price tag. Second day ticket is a fraction of the cost of day one. Lines were 20 30 minutes on a Saturday unheard of at other Disney locations.Like the other Disney parks the castle and several other areas are being brought into the 21st century so expect some closures. If your a Disney fan make the stop. In just a few hour layover we were able to ride two rides, explore Main Street, grab lunch and see more than half of the parade.",4
"Similar to the parks in Tokyo, it's miles ahead of Disneyland Paris (which is atrocious). We got to meet Cinderella, Duffy, Iron Man, Tigger, Winnie The Pooh, StellaLou, Pluto, Goofy, Snow White and saw Ariel. The food and snacks available are tasty and we ate at The Explorer's Club Restaurant where you can choose from a variety of Asian menus. The Iron Man Experience, a ride like Star Tours, is also open now.",4
Pros:My second visit here. There are new attraction especially the iron man ride. There are also some upgrades and renovations on some of the rides compared to the last round I came which is ten over years ago. Food prices are more reasonable with varieties though taste not very fantastic. Queues are quite long probably due to their public holidays and school holidays and quite a lot of their locals are in the park too. Just a note that there are no more fireworks and parade of the characters. Only lightning visuals displays. Toilets there are cleaner than before and it   s air conditioned. Most of the rides are indoors which is good as the summer period can be very hot like in Singapore. Cons:Not many complaints except for the long queuing time. Worth to visit again if there are new rides in future.,4
"It   s my 2nd time there in 3 years. This time round we found that some of the ride didn   t seem as good as before as they may have made some alterations. Example that it   s a small world ride used to keep repeating the song the last time but this time it   s just played once combined with the music. The other Pooh ride used to have a lot of pretty panels each time you turn into an area but now it seems the amount of panels has lessen and the ride shorten. Even the night parade cars are less gorgeous as the 1st time we saw it. But then we also discovered other rides we haven   t been able to ride on the first time we went. The new iron man experience was quite awesome! There   s also an iron man virtual reality game for my 2 yr old son at the store in the Tomorrowland which is quite fun while his parents went solo and used the fast passes for the main attractions. As for the other ride we tried as single rider while our son slept, it   s the toy soldier parachute drop. It   s not for young kids.. but teens shld be able to withstand the excitement and not break into tears. Also we think the mickey   s philharmagic at fantasyland is pretty awesome but then my son was a bit scare of it maybe due to the loud noise inside.. so really have to consider if bringing very young kids there. The only one ride that my son loves is the slinky dog spin at toy story land. As for the other ride that his parents enjoyed, it   s the mystic manor. As usual it   s not for very young kids as it   s quite dark in there and can be scary for them. My son is pretty cool with the dumbo ride and obitron which is pretty much the same type of ride. As for food, we think the best food court is at fantasyland and also mystic point. It   s good to go during weekdays as it   s less crowded and if there in summer, do 1 2 of the outdoor rides u wish to try before going indoors for the rest till later in the afternoon. This works really well for us as we try the dumbo and obitron ride first before going indoors for other rides like Pooh ride, mickey   s philarmagic, it   s a small world, Ironman and hyperspace mountain, till later in the day when it   s not so hot did we go to toy story area for the other rides there. Utilize the fast passes and single rider options when you   re there to save some time in the park.",4
Disneyland is always a great place to spend a day. The staff are happy to give you stickers if you ask them. All of the staff carry them. The rides of course are the big attraction along with the meet and greet with the characters. A great family day out,4
This disneyland is little small. You can complete it easily. Rides are good and enjoyable. Kids will have the most fun with shows and disney parade. Enjoyed ! Food is not allowed inside and they throw it if found. Just take care.,4
As two adults this was so much fun. The attractions were within easy walking distance. It was well organized and so clean. The parade was an added bonus. Most restaurants were fast food but some had good food. Good value for the entry price.,4
"A fun, whole day outing for the family. Their fireworks and the parade are not to be missed. The lion king show was fun, and good enjoyment (you get to sit down for a while, and get some rest too)! Also, dodon't forget to get pics clicked with disney characters in the garden area. ",4
"Visited with family on a quiet day luckilyJust wish they would cater more for the disabled. I am registered blind and do not use any rides, however you can only have a disabled ticket and price of 100 hk dollars if you are a resident otherwise it's full priceSo it makes it very expensive day for me just to get pushed round. Luckily it wasdon't too busy as this Disney doesdon't do the fast pass entry for those with disabled guests either like Shanghai one does. I had to queue in the line with my daughter and son in law or they had to leave me in the wheelchair before entering line, which can be is uncomfortable when you have very little vision Most staff seem friendly, Overall good but could do better for people with disabilities ",4
"My family really enjoyed this park. They have some great rides only found at this park. A comment that gets mentioned a lot is that this is smaller than some of the other parks, and that is true, but it is also less congested than most of the other parks by a good margin, meaning you'll ride more rides and spend less time waiting. Dining selections for sit down  table service is limited, but there is plenty of food. All in all, we would love to come back some day.",4
"Whichever Disneyland you visit, it   s still a magical place that brings you back to the fond memories of your childhood watching all those Disney cartoons. Smaller in size compared to other Disneylands, it makes it very bearable to walk through the park. Since it is smaller, it has fewer attractions but the essential ones are there. One piece of advice, do price comparisons of the souvenirs and try as much not to buy it in the stores at Main Streey.",4
A great place to visit with the kids as they have lots of fun... but if ur an indian who eats vegetarian food. Please be cautious as to get something worth eating which would fill u could majorly be ice creams as the popcorns are also mostly caramel that is available... so eat a good breakfast before u get there. The not to miss is all the rides and specially the little world show of dolls. Fun unlimited for kids as they get to click pictures with all the characters of disney here and there...You will need 2days atleast to cover with kids... you start and end with the U.S street there are some places to eat Its best to download their app and be on time for all shows... know how long the lines are in which ride or show... definitely an enjoyable experience ,4
"Note: there   s an on going renovation of the castle; it may be something you would like to consider.Ticket price: 619 hkd for adult for the 1 day passWe bought out tickets at chungking mansion at TST at the money changer there. They usually sell it 590 hkd but we were able to haggle it dow to 580 hkd. Just be Charming and nice.You can also try KLOOK app. They offer discounts and promos but due to our credit card policy we opted not to purchase it there.I   ve been to to Disneyland for a couple of times and through experience. Here are my tips for you to maximise your time.1.download disneyland hk app on your phone or avail the brochures for schedules and map.  ITS FREE2.plan ahead of time! What rides you want to do. It   s a personal preference.3.finish all the rides on your list before taking pictures. Picture taking will consume most of your time and before you   ll know it, people are already flocking.4.it opens 10AM 8:30PM no fireworks after or you may ask some staffs if they do have that day.5. Its wifi almost everywhere. Bring extra batteries for your phone or cameras. Selfie sticks are not allowed.6. Have a heavy breakfast! Foods are expensive! Or take your lunch early or late. Tables in the restaurant are limited.7. Wear comfortable shoes and dress!8. Have fun!",4
"Brings back all your childhood memories. A bit crowded and expect long lines everywhere. Also, requires a lot of walking and patience.",4
Ignore the bad reviews I went today and had an amazing time!!! Yes it   s a small park compared to Disney world in Florida but I expected that!!! I got to do most of rides walk on and the cast members are friendly! Just know that if you come during the summer it rains a lot so bring an umbrella!!! ,4
"I had average expectations before going as it is the smallest of all the Disney parks and I have been to Anaheim before. However what greeted me was Disney at its finest. The smaller park size was somewhat an advantage as we got like we ride all the rides more than once and see the shows (which do not disappoint). The castle is a bit of a let down, however it is currently under construction so will shortly be on par. The toy story area was definitely a must see. ",4
"We first experienced 'Disneyland' in Anaheim California in 1984 with our young children, so our visit to Hong Kong Disneyland was as 'retirees' .. and 'just for fun'. It is much smaller but very easy to get around and we were some of the first to arrive in the morning, and last to leave after a 'Halloween' parade at night. We enjoyed every experience from rides to interactive shows and look forward to the day when we can return with some of our grandchildren.",4
"Visited on a Sunday, unfortunately, and it was one of those hot, bright days (3rd June) which meant we couldnt cover too much. Wasted too much time and exhausted ourselves at the start itself waiting for the customary Mickey Minnie photo. Skip it if the line is too long and esp if you are staying at one of the Disney hotels where you can anyway meet them at breakfast. Plan the itinerary well because its no fun going from one land to another in confusion. Its much too hot, food is overpriced, and they dodon't accept anything but cash for most small purchases like icecream. Although they say outside food and drink not allowed, no one really objected to ours although they checked our bags. Some of the rides like Dumbo and It's a small world are really worth waiting for, but the lines for the Winnie the pooh boat ride were so long and the ride just quite repetitive. I guess you have to prioritize based on your interests. Cadon't cover it all! By the time we made it to the Lion King show, we were near collapse, I was afraid my son had caught a heat stroke, and we beat a hasty retreat. Happiest place on earth? No way, not in this weather. Not at all. Be careful when you visit in May June with small kids.",4
"Nice park with mostly all the characters. Enjoy 4D rides as well Iron Man is not to miss : ), Different characters come out with getup to take pics, make sure you stand in queue on time as they do not allow many people at a single time to click with them. This place is very big and require at least 2 days. Fun for children's and not to be miss by adults too ...Cheers",4
"i couldn   t ask for more except perhaps we should have done it on a colder month and spent a whole day inside the happiest place on earth.we got there at lunchtime and left before sunset to catch our flight home. my husband got nauseous on his first roller coaster ride while our son and i enjoyed the rest of the rides, especially ironman, parachute ride and the horseshoe coaster ride.this theme park is a perfect venue for a family getaway. you   ll enjoy every second you   re there.",4
"We took the two day pass and it was necessary with the kids. Yes, waiting times are crazy, its not as big as Paris Disney and the food is so so, but that's not why you're here, is it? Kids had a great time and the parades were lovely. ",4
"I was only able to visit HK Disneyland for a few hours due to time constraints but i felt that the park was small enough that i was able to explore most of it within my limited time there. I was able to go on three rides   Iron Man Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, and Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. I did not wait more than 20 minutes for any of the rides. Though most of the park is designed to look like the original Disney World, the Iron Man ride had a Hong Kong theme. Lunch at the Explorer's Club Restaurant (in Mystic Point) was pricey but good. This park does not compare to the original Disney World, however, it is interesting to visit an international Disney park. The cost of admission is around 600 HKD ($80 USD). I would recommend this park if you are a Disney lover and have a free day while visiting HK. It is easily accessible by MTR.",4
When we were heading to this place some in our group said that this place is only for the children. We will come out in half a day and go out for some other place. But one day was insufficient for the Disney land you need at least one more day. All the events and attractions were too good. Of all the paradeby 8.30pm was classic. More than the children all of us enjoyed. ,4
"Although the crowds were huge we still had a great day, we enjoyed the faster rides, make sure you take advantage of fast tracking rides to avoid ques, plan your day as you will miss the character picture sessions. The parade at nights was fantastic, get there early. ",4
"We liked our stay in the park. There were lot of different attractions, but mostly for small children. There was not many vegetarian options, and the food is not very good.",4
"I have visited most Disney parks and this is a good one, although not as large as the US or Paris parks. There are a good selection of rides and we particularly enjoyed the Iron Man simulator. The choice of food in the park seemed limited with many of the concession stands closed. It was not too busy on a Sunday in May so the queues were not too long. We managed to get on most of the rides during our 6 hour visit.Transport to the park was very easy, we took the MTR and the Disney line by the park was very cute, with mouse shaped windows!",4
"Open at 9:30am for buying ticket and at 10:00am there   s a special lucky guest to open to disneyland gate. It was hot and recommended to bring extra tshirt. Do come early or else you get stranded in long queue. Manage to see goofy, mickey mouse, minnie mouse and donald duck from far. It was crowded but my brother and I manage to play all the game. It was fun roller coster ride and worthy game. From Marvel hero, Buzz Lightyear ride, winnie the pooh, Tarzan and more disney related. Few places still under construction. Bring extra money as gift shops is everywhere and sometime tempting to buy. We didnt stay till late night cause otw back to MRT it was crowded.",4
"came to the first disney here in China .expecting splendid rides and service. But, my BF and i thought the entire place was not only secluded, the service quality by some of the staff were not up to disney standards.   Needs much improvements.",4
"Disneyland never fails to amaze me with surprises. There are new rides as I recalled from the last time I visited  Toy Story, Iron Man, Mystic Manor, and the like. However, I am quite unaware about how time quickly skips by. The queues to the rides   almost all  took around 30 40 minutes. And we rarely chance on character greetings   only R2 D2 and Chewbacca at Star Wars. Mickey and Minnie and Baymax is always fully queued or unavailable. :( I think our whole day's worth of visit was not enough. But again, we had fun. ",4
"This is our first time to the Disneyland after 13 years since its opening. I like the size of the park for it's spacious but not too big. Every spot can be accessed easily without the need to walk too far. Thank you for all the cast members for being so professional (except for one or two) especially under the hot weather. However, I would like to suggest Disneyland to install misting system in the park before the hot summer comes. It's only May but it gets quite hot already and I cadon't imagine how it's like in Jun Sep. The hot weather may lower people's interests in visiting the park. I remember that when I went to theme parks in other countries, they have misting system which helps cool guests down. Maybe they should consider that too. Also, I think they should place more canopies along the pathways so that guests can take a rest from the sun during the summer. I truly hope that everyone will enjoy their visits to Disneyland.",4
Disneyland was just as expected. Easy to get to   as soon as you step out of the MTR you are right at the entrance. All the favourite characters were there and some great rides for all ages. It's big enough to keep you entertained and small enough to see in 1 day. Expensive merchandise (as expected) but otherwise a really great day. Even with a lot of people the queues weredon't too long. They are very good at entertaining you as you stand in line. It's very professional and runs smoothly. Lost my phone on the first ride and the helpful and friendly staff quickly found it for me. Our 7 year old said she had the best day of her life! It's just a happy place!,4
"If you are looking to do the maximum in one day, this park is the one to visit! It was not crowded at all and the smaller size makes it perfect for doing everything you want to do and do your favorites more than once! Hong Kong Disneyland has many of the same attractions as other Disneylands (Small World, Space Mountain, etc.) and the stage shows performances are top notch!The Disneyland Cast Members are not as outgoing as in other Disneylands (I think due to the culture) but things ran very smoothly.",4
"If you are in Hong Kong, you have visit this park. It is easy park to explore in a day. The lines are short, most of our wait times were around five minutes. Of course, we visited this park during the week in the off season. Iron man, Mystic Manor, and Big Grizzly Run were my favorite rides. Nice food options but the stand for Fish and Chips and Chicken fingers was closed near the Grizzly Run. ",4
This is my 2nd visit to Disneyland. It is predominantly for young kids. They have introduced a new roller coaster which is superb. RC racer in Toyland is also thrilling. Avengers ride is very nice with the 3d effects. The castle is under renovation till July so no fireworks and laser show. Also the Parade at 4 pm was not very big and nice. Getting vegetarian food is a challenge as only few restaurant serve veg food within Disneyland. We reached Disneyland via MTR and the metro from Sunny Bay to Disneyland is very nice. Overall Hong Kong Disneyland misses the Disney charm. ,4
"We went just after Christmas with the family and it was fun, although not too big compare to other Disneyland still plenty to do and kids loved it!  Definitely recommended especially for the children, its Disneyland :)",4
"Easy to reach by MTR. It's a somewhat smaller version compared to Disneyworld in Florida, but is as much fun! Park is clean and well maintained and has a lot of shops with Disney merchandise. When we visited the park (weekday) it was not that crowded and also the waiting times for the attractions were okay! They have also the parade at scheduled times.",4
"This was the only reason visiting HK with family, and it diddon't disappointed us. We were around group of 12, with 5 kids in the group. Liked most of the park, and what I liked most was, rides were not too risky or adventurous, and were quite easy for the kids. I felt, 1 day is sufficient, as I did most of the rides and stuff, and saw evening parade, which I feel is must see. Next time, Disney Land Paris...",4
"It was my dream during my childhood days to see a Disneyland. Now, my childhood dreams comes to reality. Me and my friends recently got here. I was amazed by the beauty of Disneyland. The area is so huge. The rides are free. You can see a lot of souvenir shops as well as restaurants too. Since its summer, there are lots of group tourists and locals around. Better be early or you can go late in the afternoon. Better bring water bottle, extra clothes, hats, towels too. The scorching heat of sun rays is unbearable so use umbrella if you have sensitive skin.Sadly, we were not able to see the Disneyland castle up close because the area is under maintenance and upgrade. There is no fireworks display. But they have this parade (festival of lion king show) right before the disneyland close. Overall, Disneyland is for all ages. Highly recommended it especially to the childrens.",4
"The experience would be excellence if not for the super hot weather. We forgot to bring along sunblock and we got sunburnt after our 2nd day in Disneyland. We went on a weekday and the queue wasdon't too long. There wasdon't a queue at the IronMan experience when we went over in the afternoon. There wasdon't a need for Fast Pass at all. It was a pity the castle was under renovations when we visited, and there were not many theatre shows. No more Golden Mickey show, and the show replacing this was closed. The best food for lunch dinner would be at the Royal Banquet Hall. The Japanese Ramen set with chicken wings is value for money!",4
"I went to the original Disneyland in 1955 as a child opening year. There is something about main street that is such a happy place. This property is very small by Disney standards but as seniors, we were treated to all the park has to offer for a whopping entrance fee of $12 US. We rode the important rides and enjoyed the perfect weather. Get there when it opens to avoid the crowds. It's easy to get to by many transportation methods. We diddon't find much to eat in the park? Perhaps the restaurants are all at the adjacent hotels. Naturally, the Disney standard of great staff and spotless grounds was evident. I saw lots of kids having a great time and we got to be kids again too, The Sleeping Beauty Castle was closed for renovation so check first if this is important to your family.",4
"place is easy to get to by MTR and switching lines at the Sunny Day station, we went to the most upscale hotel that looks like the grand Floridian. we were very impressed by the vibe and the relaxed pace at the hotel   spacious, clean, all disney themes.",4
"While nowhere near the size or grandeur of some other Disney venues, and not having the standard fast track, we decided to pay for a private tour for the two of us and our 12 yo grandsonWhile not cheap (not so bad if more kids to spread it around) it was a great investmentStraight to the front for each ride, front row for all entertainments, and for the scary or energetic rides the guide went on them with our grandsonFront row in separate area at the start of the grand parade and reserved seats for lunchAll in all 4 hours but saw and did everything we wantedHighly recommend",4
"We   d been to Tokyo Disneyland and now HK. Was fun, a bit disappointing the castle was closed. Bring an umbrella, rain, hail or shine.",4
"The place is well connected through the MTR (Disney line), which is a great way to start off the experience. The MTR train is Disney themed. The Disneyland station is cute! The Disneyland is not huge, but it is a good way to spend the day. There are many activities for kids, but not so many for adults. But just going through all the different parts of the park will take up a good amount of time. We went on a weekday and did not need to wait long in queues, so it was good that we did not buy the express ticket. The souvenirs are expensive, so be prepared.",4
"They aren   t many Disney lands in Asia, but Hong Kong   s definitely an experience you must have. Not big as the others in America or Europe but got all you want and need. Unfortunately, there aren   t too much exciting facilities for grown ups yet.",4
"Usual Disney experience. Quite easy to access via MTR. Luggage place to leave suitcases , great option if you have a late flight.",4
"We had a great time at Disney with our 15 month old. The park is much smaller than Shanghai Disney (where we went last year) but I actually like it that way because you don   t waste so much time walking between parts of the park. Really liked the food options. We ate at the Starlite Diner and the Corner Cafe   both infinitely better than food at SH Disney. As to be expected, all the cast members do a great job. We especially liked the Lion King show   it   s a cant miss show. One thing I was disappointed was HyperSpace mountain; it could   ve been much better than it is. Overall, I   d choose Shanghai Disney over HK Disney but HK is still really great and I   d go again in a heartbeat. ",4
"Hong Kong Disneyland is a lot of fun , a lot smaller than most but packed full of fun rides a jungle safari and a great boat ride through large caves with all the disney characters singing and performing, it reslly was an enjoyable day and the disney train ride there is pretty cool as well.",4
"Second visit to HKDL   Tips:(1) If you want a picture with Mickey & Minnie, they open Main Street before the park opening and they are together in the gazebo right bast the train station. Even arriving 15 minutes before park opening on a Saturday in late April, the line already took 1  hrs. Line appears deceivingly short   however, people in bigger groups want to take pictures in every fathomable combination, and there are  hidden  family members sitting on benches waiting to cut in at the last minute. You can also interact with the characters for longer than in the U.S. parks., so that's nice, but kind of painful for the people in line that are waiting.(2) Buy tickets on Klook   it's about $10 USD cheaper. Just show the confirmation on your phone at the front entrance, no need to print. Very reliable.(3) Workers do not seem to know about ingredients for food allergies (e.g. peanuts), which isdon't as common in Asia as in the U.S.   so just look out for yourself and eat something safe.Overall, very fun park, less crowded than the U.S. Cute merchandise to buy   you can actually find nearly everything in the HK airport Disney Store.",4
"It was definitely worth going to for a day if you have small children. The access by the MRT was phenomenal. It was well laid out, but the size was much smaller than the other Disney properties. Lines were non existent, that was fantastic. I think 10 minutes was the longest wait time, so we never minded when the ride was a dud since we did not wait long to go on it. It was still expensive, but not as expensive as those in the States. We were through the entire park on all the rides by early afternoon. ",4
"We were a little hesitant in our trip to Hong Kong Disneyland as we had read quite a few reviews stating it was not worth the money. I can tell you that this not correct. Although quite a bit smaller than the American counterparts, Hong Kong Disneyland still delivers the magic. Unfortunately for us there was redevelopment of the Castle (which we knew of going in) which was a shame but the overall experience was great. It had some very unique rides like Mystic Manor which makes this place worth it. Highly recommend for everyone especially those with young families as places like Toy Story Land is a draw card.",4
My first ever Disney experience and what a wonderful little park it was. Made me feel like a child again.   Easy to get   with the direct trains.   This theme park does not need a review. It   s a great fun day out for all ages. Avoid going weekends as it can get extremely busy. we went on a Wednesday and luckily was not that busy.   longest we waited for a ride was 20mins.   The lion king show  iron man experience is a must see and the parade with all Disney characters was great fun. its happens x2. Once at 1400hrs and then last one at 1800hrs. A lot of food option and yes there is a HALAL option to.   Make your way to the Express club for traditional Indian options. Overall a good day out for all ages.,4
"We had a grand time at Disneyland. Boarding the train with a Mickey Mouse logo sets all the happy mood for Disneyland goers like us, especially the kids. The parade was awesome, the rides were great! Only we had to queue for like an hour and a half to have a photo with Mickey and Minnie; we were quite lucky I must say for other speactators were not able to make it as the staff had to cut the queue off. We were not able to visit all the attractions in the map due to long queues in the rides and photo opportunities with Disney characters. No fireworks during our visit, we only had the We Love Mickey Digital Show. Overall, it   s always a good experience when you   re in Disneyland. ",4
"Great for family. HKG Disney is probably the smallest one of all Disney theme parks around the world, but still great to visit. Crowds have been much more manageable and queues much more reasonable ever since Shanghi Disney opened. Tickets are priced ok .. food options inside are average, but consistent with what you'd expect for a Disney park.",4
"It is easy to see why Disneylands are in such great repair compared to most theme parks around the world   the prices for everything from entry to anything purchased inside are so over the top, this place makes a fortune with the large crowds that go. The rides, character meet ups, shows, etc are all fantastic. Just expect very long waits for every ride. Make use of the Fastpass rides offered. Unfortunately there are not enough of these though.",4
"Disneyland does not need a review its majestic in every sense. I was travelling with my family and all of us indeed enjoyed a lot. All the rides were fun. However, being a Vegan was something which disappointed me for the first time in my life. Finding veg food in disney is not at all easy, there are only one or two options at max available at the their various food courts. One of them is french fries which I do not like much and the other one is some Chinese dish which I do not understand. The only option left with me was to toss and choose. I guess disney shall work on this considering a lot of Indians travelling to this park every day.Please try to skip the weekends and that is what we did, still we came across 10 15 mins of waiting time before almost all the rides.",4
"Hong Kong Disneyland is a single park and is fairly small but is great fun. It has some different attractions to other parks and the three Disney hotels are within walking distance. Being small, during busy periods it can feel crowded although the locals do not seem to flock to the big fast rides, resulting in shorter wait times. We went in April and didn   t wait longer than 20 mins for anything. One thing to watch is food choice, which can be limited and very limited for vegetarians. The parades were good and easily visible without the US obligatory 1 hour saving spaces! All in all very much worth a visit. If thinking of visiting for more than 1 day take a look at the annual pass that may be better value",4
We visited Disneyland on a Tuesday and there was literally NO wait in any lines!! We arrived right before the park opened and was able to walk right onto the rides. It is a much smaller park than other Disneylands but just as much fun!! We enjoyed a nice lunch and the place is so clean!! This is a nice place to take your children for the day while visiting Hong Kong!!,4
"Had a fantastic day at Disneyland HK. Went with our parents for Dad   s 70th Birthday (his choice!). Stand outs for us were Hyperspace Mountain (roller coaster in the dark), RC Racing (not Dad!), Mickey   s PhilharMagic and the Lion King show. Over 65   s get a huge discounted ticket only $100 instead of usual $619   absolute bargain! Would recommend for all ages!",4
Disneyland can be access via any sunnybay station and then transfer to disneyland train you can purchase your ticket in advance so you can go direct to turnstile mine i purchased via klook and you can show it via your mobile ticket suggest to be there as early as you can so you can try all the rides when you arrive at disneyland hop on the train so they can bring you half the park during our visit the castle is under renovation and some of the theme park is close overall it was a great visit in the happiest place on earth disney land ,4
"We went to celebrate our daughter's birthday and boy did she love it. The park was well managed, the staff (cast members as they call it) were everywhere to help and suggest. The Philhar Magic and the Lion King show were amazing for the kids. The kid did every ride but a must try is the Iron Man adventure, Grizzley bear train ride and the parades that were nice. Not as big as we were told it will be but overall a fun venue to spend a day or two as a picnic.",4
It will be better if you download  Park Map so you can explore many things in less time.it was great fun attending both parade's.Food option's should add from management. All staff  was friendly.Most of the rides are for kids.,4
Nice experience using the special Disney MTR to get there.  Small but good for young children so they can walk all around the park.  Download the app to get wait time info is a good idea to plan the visit.,4
"This is Disneyland!  Suggested attractions:    Mystic Manor    Small world is a good choice if you like  easy  rides    watch the Lion King show    even if tired, wait for the closing fireworks for a complete experience",4
"It was the wish of my wife to go there and I thought I would not so much enjoy it. Well, it takes you back in your childhood and it's plain fun. Sure, there are stores everywhere and also the food is really too expensive inside, but you can eat outside between the MTR and the entrance for a quite moderate price. All in all really a great place to be.",4
"Excited games,funny show,wonderful parade,beautiful scenery. The night parade is so beautiful, don   t miss it!",4
"We have 3 children aged, 4,7,10. Great place to go when the kids are this age, you can get round the park in a day. Kids loved it, especially the rides. Make sure you use Fastpass to speed past the queues. Go to the big ticket rides during the parade as that's the quiet period for rides. NOTE you cadon't take your own food in so eat well before you go as food is a little pricy. Overall a good experience but if you have older kids they'll want bigger and more scary rides. Some activities for the kids we diddon't do as they were mostly in Cantonese, which is understandable given our location, such as the Jedi Training School.",4
Great park for kids.  Nice resort and rides for kids.  Grown ups may feel less attractive.   Great food options inside.,4
"Loved it. My 18 yr old daughter enjoyed it like a 3yr old. Line ups were as expected, or better. Only disappointment was that castle was under renovations, but that has to happen at some point. Definately worth seeing & admission price is very reasonable for a days entertainment.",4
We had a great day at Disneyland. The park is immaculate (after the parade we saw staff hoovering up the glitter with Dyson hand held machines)! Lots to do and the longest queue was 50 minutes so not too bad. Perfect sized park and the metro goes right into Disneyland.Great day had by my 9 year old and 6 year old ! ,4
Not a lot exciting if you have visited Disney parks in US but had some similar rides to that of Anaheim (LA) Park. Street Parade was good. No fireworks at night for the time being.,4
"This is a tiny park compared to Disneyland in L.A. or especially Disney World in Orlando. It is well designed and has some great rides, like Mystic Manor and Hyperspace Mountain. It was my fiancee's first Disney Park and a good one to start on without being overwhelmed.",4
Had a day in Disneyland with my wife. We are both in our Mid 50's but we had a fabulous time. It really is the happiest place. Lines were not too bad. The street parade was outstanding. The Disney Train to the park is awesome. A must visit for all those who are young at heart and a bigger must is the Tea Cup ride !!!,4
Was a lovely day at Disneyland hong kong staff helpful and friendly very clean place food was very good to lots of variety to choose from obviously not a cheap day out but well worth as there is not a lot of rides but still worth as i went twice shows are very good to see . Depends where you staying so may have to get 3 trains to get there the leg is on the Disneyland train cute train Mickey mouse ear's as Windows.. Very lovely day out,4
"2 days here is heaps, parades great, but it is not Anaheim...as long as you know that you will enjoy it Easy to get around, rides not busy in April, but go during the week as locals use Annual passes Fri Sun so crowds increase. Can take food and drink in, but keep it to snacks and no problems. Only downside was the staff were not friendly or happy (compared to Anaheim where everyone is friendly and happy).",4
"We have done all the other Disney resorts so it made sense to do this one as well. If felt odd.....Disney but not quite as we know it. Having said that, it was much quieter than any other Disney we have visited so queues etc were very small. Our daughter really enjoyed our visit. ",4
"We went here at 11am. It was a hot and humid day. We got our tickets for entrance and meals. We went around Star Wars, It's a small world, ToyStoryland, Adventureland, Fantasyland, etc. We enjoyed the Jungle River Cruise. It's so exciting we almost got wet! We had lunch at the Banquet Hall. Different choices of food. We left at 5pm.",4
"It was good. Hong kong to me has one of the most easiest train route to everywhere. For Disneyland, there are halal stores for muslim. I bought advance meal coupon from klook. This help me save a lot. Just remember to show it to them upon entering. You have to redeem it before entering Disneyland.The Night show was just average to me.( The projector show) ",4
"I was there 3 times last year. I like the theme park and its stunning playground. But the way to queue up can be troublesome for the person who must wait for long time.  Well the fireworks are beautiful!  Best regards,  Dr. Vorravee Pattaravongvisut",4
"I first came her back in 2007 shortly after just opening. The place has really gone through a major overhaul since then. The place was clean, attractions were very good, and the food, while being expensive, was very good. The castle is undergoing a major renovation, but it most likely needed it. My visit was during the schools Spring Break, so it was abnormally crowded for a Tuesday, but the cues were still tolerable for most of the rides. Toy Story Land had the worst cue times, all over an hour and no FAST PASS options. I really liked the re themed Space Mountain to Hyperspace Mountain and all of the Star Wars characters.",4
"Extremely disappointed that given that we paid a lot of money for the tickets and when we arrived, the castle was closed due to refurbishment. My daughter was most disappointed. Advance warning would have been good or a discount on the tickets as the full park was not available. There is also no clear indication when the characters come out to do the meet and greet and often it   s by chance! Iron Man simulation ride is definitely worth a visit!",4
"My 5 yrs old princess were so giddy to meet Elsa of Frozen but to her dismay Elsa and Anna are not always in Hongkong Disneyland . They only visit the park few times per month...how disappointing. When we visited the park they were celebrating the Easter Carnival and the number of guests makes the park almost congested. For every attraction, the queue is a minimum of 15minutes. We weredon't able to maximize our visit, a lot has been change since my last visit a decade ago. I am longing for a friendly ambiance not the type wherein despite you are clearly in line a kid will suddenly push your kid, lack of discipline among visitors guests are very obvious.This time diddon't see much of mascots except from the parade.",4
"If you love Disney and Disneyland parks, yes you will still love it here as Disney just has that touch of magic. But if you   ve been to Orlando Disney parka in Florida and expect it to be of the same standard... not at all! This Disney Park is very small! The iconic sleeping beauty tower that is the central heartbeat to every Disneyland looks like it   s been put in the drying machine for a bit too long and has shrunk on every side! The fact you cannot are the castle from anywhere in the Park unless you   re in main street USA just tells you how small it is! If I am honest the park entry was far too expensive for what you get in return. Especially as they have now stopped the evening fireworks and there are not a huge amount of bigger rides and shows! Even worse because at the moment the main castle is under construction so is boarded up so you can barely see it even more so now! However, as my wife and I are still huge Disney fans we still ending up having a fantastic day on all the rides, watching the shows and parades and of course walking down Main Street USA singing along to the Disney music! As we went on a weekday too not in peak season the longest we queued for a ride was 20 minutes! Most rides we went on was a 5 to 10 minute wait! Perfect! ",4
Alot of awesome attractions and activities for kids. Some good places to eat and when the queues are short it can be fantastic. The park lacks a little bit in terms of attractions for adults. If you love Disney then you'll love it for sure.,4
"We had a very enjoyable day out at HK Disneyland. The highlight was the Star Wars ride and the grizzly gulch ride. Early in the morning and later in the evening wait times for rides are 20 30 mins however early afternoon they were well over 50 minutes. The park is very clean with lots of stores and refreshment stands throughout   considering it's Disneyland, prices were not too bad for food and drink. I just wish the park felt more Disney   no characters wandering around as they are in their own sections where you have to line up to get a photo. The parade at the end of the night was nothing special and the music playing wasdon't Disney themed.There are also no fireworks anymore and the castle is currently being renovated. Overall a very good day out, but could still be better!",4
"targeted for the younger kids, there was a couple of awesome rides for the adults, starwars ride and the grizzly bear right both roller coasters no loops though.",4
"The MTR directly to Disneyland Hong Kong is the best way to reach the park.Be aware at the long queues for entrance, even if you purchased your tickets online. Again, long queues for everything inside. Sometimes you questioned yourself why they don   t set a maximum number of visitors per day.. the night parade is a must see! Love it!Toilets very clean!Kids and adults having fun all day! ",4
"Disneyland around the world still gives off a magical vibes despite the size! Sleeping Beauty's castle was cordoned off for maintenance so that was a bummer but apart from that, all rides are open. I went in during the opening time and I left before 3pm after finishing all the rides I wanted to take (which is the adult ish rides)Around 2pm, queues were forming so if you guys wna spend half a day in Disneyland, just head there early.Also, HK Disneyland has a mobile app which is very convenient so you dodon't have to hold on to the park map. That app tells you the waiting time of the attractions, entertainment, dining and shopping etc. Pls download it!",4
"We spent 1 1 2 days here and had a great time! The queue times were quite short waited 20 mins at the most both days. Our boys are 7 & 12 and their favourite rides were Hyperspace Mountain, Iron Man, RC Racer and Mystic Mountain. We were on these many times! We had purchased some kids meal vouchers from Klook which ended up being a waste of money. There are only a few locations you can use them and only 1 meal option at each so not a lot to chose from. So would not recommend these vouchers. There are a number of eateries at the park and the food was good. It's a great day out for a family! ",4
"For our 18th wedding anniversary, I decided to keep us local and to take my husband and our 2 teens to Disneyland. In the past we've gone to Macau for the weekend. We've lived here in Hong Kong for over 10 years and had never been to Disneyland, so it was well over due.I splurged on connecting rooms in the nicest resort, and they did not disappoint. The view, the spaciousness, the service, all Top notch!We were very well taken care of in the Kingdom Club, though the resort did not cater to relaxing adult time. If we wanted to have a cocktail before dinner, we had to sit in our room. The Sea Breeze lounge by the pool was closed the whole weekend, and so drinks by the poolside meant going through room service and it took 30 minutes. And ordering drinks at dinner, including Cokes for the kids, needed to be very strategic as it could take upwards of 15 20 minutes. The whole resort seems very accustomed to a mainland Chinese clientele, but we could tell the manager was looking after us to make sure we were enjoying our meals. The sense of playfulness and whimsy about the place is infectious, so we all really did enjoy our time there.All in all, I'm glad we went, but for the price, we could have gone to Thailand, to be honest. We had a lovely time, everybody was very nice, and the hotel and our rooms were gorgeous, but there's no desire by either of us to go back again. ",4
"You are never too old to enjoy the wonders of Walt Disney. However, Hong Kong Disneyland does seem to cater for a younger and less thrill seeking visitor so for those wanting big rides and thrills at every turn then this may not be the place for you. Only purchase a one day pass as this place can be easily done in half a day and remember that the weather is hot and humid so beware! The queues are relatively small, in fact we walked straight to the front on nearly every ride but I would suggest getting there at open time to avoid any queues but more importantly, avoid the temperatures. Make sure you check out the times for meeting the characters. We were rather surprised by how accommodating the characters were in the sense that they spent a lot of time with each visitor or family and happily posed for numerous phones and cameras and various poses. We would suggest getting in the queues for the characters at least 10 minutes before but the queues for Minnie and Mickey are long so get there early!",4
The Disneyland was true enough smaller than the rest of the Disneylands. Queue guide was good. Usually shorter than what they stated. Good for kids above 8. We went on the new year eve and there were street performance. Toilets are clean. During meal times the place are CROWDED. ,4
"Given several visits to Disney   s US based attractions I was generally impressed with their Asian version. Rides stayed true to the originals while paying a bit of homage to new ideas....we absolutely loved Hyperspace Mountain, Grisley Gulch, and It   s a small world. Very easy to get around and I think they did an exceptional job of making sure the attractions were still enjoyable for those who spoke any English.Only complaints are that I found their WiFi to be very spotty and slow, which Impacted our ability to use the app, and the times listed on line lengths were very inaccurate.The folks on Disney   s property seemed to implement Disney   s traditional atmosphere of hospitality....the same can   t be said for the transportation segment on the way there....we found the bus driver to be very disinterested in answering a simple question...A good experience overall....not as good as the original but a very good representation for Asia.",4
Spent a great time with family. Kids are excited to be there.   Purchased 3 in 1 meal voucher but just redeem for lunch. Few restaurant not available for dinner.,4
It   s expanded a lot since I visited 5 years ago but mainly a lot of experiences and eating spots. The weather was hot and the food was so so but the kids still had a good time going on all the rides from tweens To young kids. There is a lot of walking from one end to the other made a little more inconvenient because it   s so far and fantasyland castle is closed. Would warn people not to buy any food outside the park even though it looks like a Disneyland sanctioned store with people wearing Disneyland clothes. Because you won   t be allowed into the park. ,4
"We recently had our family trip, 3 generations in one group.Kids were of course, blown away with the idea that they're spending a day in HK Disneyland for one whole day.New attractions we saw this time was of course, the Iron Man Experience. It reminded me a lot of Star Tours.We would never ignore our family's old favorites of course, the Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Mine Cars, and Parachute Drop.",4
"Just 20 minutes from central Hong Kong, HK DL is a very floral and delightfully small amusement park. There are many unique rides and attraction only found at this park. Don   t miss Hyperspace Mountain; Mystic Manor, think Haunted Mansion meets Night at the Museum; and...More",4
"Hong Kong Disneyland must be a 60 70% of the L.A. Disneyland,and at 60 70% of the LA.Price, but it is absolutly worth going,   It has very litle of chinese ambient, i thought they would use this a bit more.  We went there on a weekday in...More",4
We visited Disneyland on 22 3 18. The kids had the absolute fun! Quite disappointed to find out that the castle was closed for refurbishment. The queue was quite long for most of the rides but we queued nonetheless. Husband enjoyed the iron man 3D experience and we all loved the light parade ,4
"I visited Hong Kong Disneyland during a week day and it was not that crowded which allowed me to enjoy the visit. One whole day trip ticket includes entry to all the events and it is not that expensive. Small World, Train ride, Boat ride, Roller coaster rides (even though I got freaked out!) are worth enjoying. As to any other Disneyland, the most interesting part is to attend the Night Parade. There is a day parade in the afternoon and a night parade with illumination. Unlike Tokyo Disneyland where one day visit may not be enough, we can cover almost all the rides in Hong Kong Disneyland in one day. Worth the visit.",4
Yes Park is small and underwhelming but the rides themselves are more often than not as good or better than Disney Orlando which I   ve Been to 20 times as they are newer and more modern takes:Everything is scaled down ..Main Street ..Castle (which is actually a bit of a sad attempt ..almost a paper cutout effect)Again park is small an underwhelming but worth a day is you have time to knock it off your Disney. bucket list,4
"HKDL is a small park and with the construction going on, feels even smaller. It's a good park for families with little kids, or if you just want to tell people that you've been to Disneyland.We were there over a weekend in March. It wasdon't very packed but it was quite busy as it was the start of their Springtime event. Most of the rides wait times were around 20 30 minutes, with it being noticeably longer on the Saturday. The park still uses paper fast passes, and only for a few rides. They make nice souvenirs though, so you can collect and keep them instead :)The rides and shows can be done in one full day but if you want to do the character meets, it will take you 2 days to cover everything. 2 days tickets only cost a little bit more than a 1 day ticket.Iron Man Experience was interesting, I liked that it was both in Cantonese and English. I'm not sure if they had multiple versions like in Star Tours. And it really made me want to eat dim sum.The best reason to visit HKDL : there is halal food and a prayer room available. The variety of food has increased and now the Main Street Marketplace (the little snack shack in between the Main Street Bakery and the Chow Tai Fook jewelery store) is also certified halal and sells (wait for it) HALAL TURKEY DRUMSTICKS. So friends, we must support, OK?The park sells meal vouchers for a discount, and while it looks like a good deal, I find it quite difficult to eat 2 square meals as their meal portions are sensibly large. Fortunately, we had Magic Access which offered a 25% discount off dining, and used that instead.The fireworks show has ended since the castle is being torn down, and instead they do a projection show down Main Street. Mickey makes an appearance at the end of the street near the central gazebo and we love the Mickey shaped confetti.Unlike Tokyo and Anaheim, HKDL opens later, which is nice because you can sleep in. There is a priority entrance for visitors with Platinum Magic Access and hotel guests, which is nice because the lines are always shorter.",4
"Unlike Universal or Ocean park, Disneyland does not have concept of express pass. However they do issue free fast track pass for certain key rides. Fast track pass kiosk are located besides those specific key rides. you just need to scan you ticket to get your free fast track pass, which will allot you specific time. you can enjoy other rides and come back these rides at your allotted time, without much queuing up. Only catch is, you can have fast track pass active for one ride at a time, so cannot collect token for all rides in one go, but still quite a time saving.",4
"As expected HK Disneyland is a smaller scale than DisneyWorld but it still has the iconic Disney layout and attractions with a local twist. Don   t miss Mickey   s Amazing Storybook show. Although it   s worth the visit, it   s interesting how being a    foreigner    changed our overall experience.",4
"Small, with just a few major rides, but clean and beautiful. Well organised, efficient. On the day we went, a Tuesday, it was not too busy. However in consequence, food stalls and some rides and shows closed up at 6pm, when the park was officially open to 7:30 the day we went. Also, there was a lot of construction, with the castle and several other areas cordoned off. I estimate 10% of the park was closed, so not happy to be charged full price, added to the early closing of stalls and shows. Not to Disney standards. But otherwise great atmosphere, and running smoothly. I noticed that some of the electrics on the light parade were not working, so the park could use some maintenance. That said, toilets very clean as we're the walkways.",4
"Went with family during Lunar New Year week and was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasdon't too crowded. Diddon't wait for more than 30 minutes for any of the rides. I kept hearing how it is smaller than other Disney's around the world but it had enough rides and attractions to enjoy for a full day. We went when it opened in the morning and stayed until the very end of the parade and was not bored. Also loved the fact that we were able to take photos with Mickey and Minnie dressed in Chinese costumes, although had to wait in line for almost an hour for that.",4
"It   s Disneyland ! Though compared with the LA or Tokyo ones the Hong Kong Disneyland is a much more scale down version ; with a smaller park area. However it works perfectly when you have a younger child as it is not as tiring for younger kids. The lines were not as crazy compared to the bigger parks in LA and Tokyo . We had been able to try out most of the rides even though we start our day about noon and the park closed much earlier compared to the other countries. As we stayed at the Disneyland hotel , it was just an easy stroll or shuttle back to our room after a long tiring day out at the theme park. ",4
"This Disneyland, is very similar to others, but it is on a smaller scale. Having been their twice, both on relatively crowded days, we still only spent less than 6 hours there, including lunch to cover most of the popular rides and attractions. Of course we could have stayed longer if we wanted to hit every ride, but because of the relatively smaller footprint and repetitive attractions from other parks, we spent most of our time checking out those things that might be a little different. Food is not very good at all, from any of the three restaurants we tried. It is still a great place to go, but dodon't expect to be wowed by the experience if you are Disney veteran. ",4
"This is a manageable sized Disney Park great for younger children. Very manageable in a days trip with queues at again a length that younger children can cope with. The rides are great and varied. Only criticism is the quality of food available, very poor We visited Orlando Disney the following month and were very disappointed and could not cope with the queues and scale of the parks. Hong Kong gets my vote for Disney ",4
Hong Kong Disneyland is not as big as the one at Anaheim but it is still fun! The train system is excellent and easy to use. Definately worth a visit.,4
"My 3rd Disneyland visit, love a fun day out. Hong Kong Disneyland is of course smaller than USAs. Best adult ride is  The Big Grizzly Mountain  awesome fun unpredictable. You wodon't get wet. Train only has 1 stop at Fantasy Land then goes straight backto the beginning again. We worked our way from F Land to Toy World, kids go nuts. Then went through Wild West where Grizzly ride is. Tarzans Tree Touse was ok., to get there was a short trip over canal. Not alot of eateries no Down Town Disney here. Small World was really good. Queuing for the River Cruise was frustrating, different entry lines different languages English line took the longest. 1 hour not worth it. Looking forward to our next Disney.",4
"My 4 and 6 year old children love Disney so where better than the happiest place on Earth. My 4 year old is 102cm exactly so we were still able to get on quite a few rides. HK Disneyland is incredibly easily accessible via MTR with a Mickey themed MTR train. But this time we chose to drive and it costs HKD220 to park the car for the day. The roads were very easy to navigate and the car park was near to empty, arriving at noon we parked in bay 5. The park was quite quiet and we had to wait no longer than 30 minutes for the rides which was perfect for us. We didn   t plan our day very well and missed the lion king show but were able to catch all the other shows. Even though HK Disneyland isn   t very big we still didn   t have enough time to get around all of the park. We missed out Adventureland. The rest of the park was well thought out, well presented and easily accessible. The toilets were well placed throughout the park. They were all clean with toilet paper and hand paper was available (locals will know this is rare!). There was also a choice of regular toilets or squat toilets. Every toilet we visited had baby changing facilities. We knew in advance that the fireworks had been cancelled so we weren   t disappointed. We used the time to go on extra rides until the park closed at 9pm. As with any Disney attraction the food was mediocre and incredibly overpriced. We still had some snacks from the many food stalls and also ate the set dinner at the Plaza Inn. The part that made the day really special for us was that my 6 year old was approached by a staff member to take part in the princess parade. For this she was sat in a prime seating area (only one parent was allowed to accompany her) to watch the parade and join in the dance with the Disney princess float. It truly made the visit memorable. Thank you Disneyland HK for making our visit so special!",4
"The rides, shows and parade definitely bring out your inner child. We're in our 40s and enjoyed the day there.  Only gripe would be that given its a Disney Park the entry into the actual park could be a bit more organised and orderly",4
"We went to Disneyland Hong Kong for one day in February 2018. We took the MRT from Kowloon and very easy to navigate. Had a good time, but must let any American travelers coming to Disneyland Hong Kong know that it is much smaller than the American version. Currently a lot of construction going on and part of the park is closed. Easy for an American to navigate as most everything is in English and Chinese. Glad I did it,but probably would not do it again. ",4
"Disney never disappoints. Disney HK is much smaller than the other Disney   s I have been too, but it   s still fun. We have been multiple times with our three young kids (7,4,2) and they continue to have a great time. Stroller friendly everywhere, changing tables in all bathrooms, and high chairs at all restaurants! Food choices are plenty, but some are different! We always pack plenty for kids to snack on. ENJOY",4
"Went to HK disneyland with my child, they love the ironman a lot. Places are clean, people is nice. Overall is good experience.",4
"Smallest of all..to what i googled.Still lot of events, attractions , rides and fun places which will easily consume your enture day. You might have to run through to cover all. Or use fast express ir a two day pass.Evening post 7 becomes all the more fun when night parade starts. I visited during the time of new year.If you are going only for rides i recommend ocean park.",4
Reasonably priced day of fun. You need to get there early and expect 40 minute lines at a lot of rides. They offer a speed pass which allows you to bypass the wait at about 8 activities one time only at each activity. I found it very beneficial time wise.,4
"I'll start by reminding you that all Disney properties are clean, efficient, well maintained, family freindly, staffed by friendly and helpful people, and have lots and lots of Disney magic. All that being said, I found Disneyland Hong Kong to be my least favorite of the four I've visited. Maybe my expectations were a bit too great, but I found that it's a little small feeling, and it seems like there are fewer attractions and definitely fewer shows than other Disney properties. The things that they do have are really good, but we were pretty well done before the sun went down on our one day visit. If it's your only Disney opportunity, definitely go. If you love Disney definitely go. Just know what to expect.",4
"We've been to both Orlando Disney and Tokyo Disney and had heard that Hong Kong was no match for either of them. We went into the park with low expectations. There were definitely some downsides to the park, but for the most part, we left feeling pleasantly surprised. THE RIDESAll the rides are super fun and innovative, and even the big ones have short lines (30 minute wait at the VERY most, but usually 10 minutes). They are exciting enough for the older ones (my teenage granddaughter loved all the rollercoasters, the new Iron Man simulator, and the Mystic Manor trackless ride  so did my 40 year old children, in fact!) but also appeal to the younger ones and have low height restrictions so my 5 yo granddaughter was able to ride EVERYTHING in the park (a first for her). THE SHOWSWe watched a live performance of Mickey and the Wondrous Book. The visuals were stunning, performances were great. Tiana stole the show with Almost There, but I must say that Elsa disappointed with Let it Go, the performer was NOT a strong singer. The dialogue was in Chinese but with English subtitles. THE FOODMeh, especially for the prices  although you MUST try the caramel popcorn! Meal vouchers are a good idea and saved us 12 bucks (USD) and we got 3 vouchers for caramel popcorns with the meal vouchers. I recommend eating at the Explorer's Cafe. THE SERVICEAlso meh, especially after having visited Tokyo Disneyland and WDW in Orlando. People did not go out of their way to assist us as in the other Disney parks. Other guests were visibly cutting in line but the Cast Members turned a blind eye. Overall, it's definitely worth a trip. If you go in the off season, you'll experience short lines and be able to do the entire park easily in a day.",4
"We have been to this Disneyland twice. So, tried all adventures for adults and for babies this time. To sum up: our daughter loved it very much and didn   t want to leave. There is a wonderful attractions for the children of 1,5 4 years as fantasy land, Pooh   s house, orbitron, jungle cruise and many others. A lot of interesting small spots to discover fairy tails. So, if you have children below 6 years old they will love it. For adults I would recommend to visit Ocean park, it if more interesting. Also I would like to note, that it is quite hard to buy healthy food for the baby on the territory of park, we have seen mostly sweets, cakes, etc. so it is better to take something with you. It will be great if some healthy food cafe will appear in the park. Most part of visitors are from China, though all attractions are mostly in English. ",4
Lot smaller than overseas Disney parks but still fun. One day is enough. Food pretty average. Parking easy and mtr also great for access. Avoid weekend crowds if possible. Very busy with mainland China tour groups. Queuing seen as    weak    so watch out for mass charge when gates open on rides. Kids will get barged our of the way! ,4
"So I thought it would be boring, as everyone said it is small in size. We went and spent 4 or 5 hours easily and not found it boring at all. We particularly enjoyed the ride at the Iron man theatre. It felt like you are in a Marvel comics yourself. I look forward to visiting it again.We stayed for the light show at the end and loved it. It is magic.",4
"Disneyland is well known throughout the world as the place  where dreams come true  and HK Disneyland is no exemption. While the place is quite small compared to other Disneyland resorts I've been to (not to speak of the huge Walt Disney World in Orlando!), it is still one of the most entertaining (but not relaxing!) places in the world. The rides are fun, the shows are great, the characters mascots are lovely, the staff are friendly, the amenities are very good, the parades and fireworks display are mesmerizing, etc. Two or three things, however, are quite disappointing in this place: first, the unbearably long queues to the rides and shows; second, the lack of discipline of the local visitors concerning hygiene and trash disposal: and, third, the humidity. Having a fast track ticket doesdon't really help that much. You'll have to get a schedule just the same. As to the humidity, perhaps they should put on more mist sprays and have more covered attractions. As to the crowd, perhaps they should limit the number of visitors per day to avoid overcrowding, and also have more personnel assigned to cleaning the premises.",4
As usual and expected. This is really amazing but starting this month and i think after 2 years castle will be renovated. No firework during our trip and galaxy is under maintenance. Food is quiet expensive but big service. People are polite and nice. Good snack bars and area is well maintained. Light the night parade is now the highlight not the fireworks,4
We have been lucky enough to visit Disney California before here. It's almost a replica and is a wonderful day out with the family. Star wars ride is awesome fun and the jungle river cruise is great too. Take loads of photos.,4
"Seen alot of people asking about ages so this is my opinion: I am 27 and went with my wife 25,We had a great time it was verry nostalgic and nice ( for people who grow up on disney )Most do every show you can because they are really nice, we did the lion king live show and another one in fantasy world wich was verry good. Few tips : Take some sandwichea with you because the food is really expensive there, and what isent expensive tastes like it...You can use your ticket to get a fast line pass, use it! Its awsome we hardly cued up for anything.Most see is the night paraid at 8:00 pm no matter how tierd you are, to get the nest position Stand near the passage ways the staff keeps open   once the parade is near they close them So you can get in on first line to get the best view ( youll know what i mean when your there )",4
"It was my first time visit Disneyland, I really love the river cruise, it's a small world, the roller coaster is fun, the Disneyland train is so nice to ride. Everything is so fun, except the line in everywhere, the queues are so long, and when i visited, the castle was closed, the restaurant open at 12 noon, i wish it could open a lil bit earlier. But overall, i would recommend to visit this place , it's nice to spend time here with friends and families.",4
It was a worthwhile trip to Disney. Nothing exceptional but still an enjoyable trip. Nice location with fun rides. Queues were pretty Long though,4
"it is a good park for family activities,i went with my friend and her kids,the kids having more great time than me  it was my first time to go Disneyland,so cadon't compare with the other Disneyland",4
"Every child's dream even some grown up childrens dream;DISNEYLAND! It's dianey, so it's a total delight. As usual it's expansive, fun, tiring in a good way but Hong Kong tends to get pretty, so ideally should visit it in winter. And the staff, right from the luggage check in to ticketing is pretty rude unnecessarily. So the trip starts with a bad taste but you kinda forget all that once inside. It's Disney. One tip, do not carry even a medium size backpack. You'll have to leave it outside with no proper storage facility provided. It's kinda off putting, and very Unprofessional.Oh yeah the train that takes you Lantau Island where is Disleyland is situated is dedicated to Disney, so your experience starts, the moment the train comes in. Pure childhood bliss. The train is full of Disney details and artifacts. Once you reach the station, the old world charm exudes a spell on you. It's beyond words, you need to experience it yourself. ",4
"This is my first Disneyland. Bought ticket from Klook for the convenience. There was still a long queue getting in at 10:00 on a Thursday. Like everyone else, we took the special Disney train from Sunny Bay. We thought we were too early when we got there before 09:30 but a huge crowd was already waiting. So we waited in line. The gate opened at 10:00 but we were only allowed into the game area at 10:30.Our first stop was the Iron Man ride. Some people actually took the fast pass and went ahead to other rides. Thought that it is smart to get fast pass for the few rides that offer this. We diddon't attempt to do it. The queue probably took 15 minutes. Then we entered the special ride area with our 3D glasses. The ride was fun, one of the best, but rather short. Next we tried the Mystic Manor. There was no queue. While I enjoyed the ride, it was even shorter than the Iron Man ride. The other highlight was the show   Mickey and the Wondrous Book. We lined up for an hour before we could get in. The line was badly managed. The moment we were allowed to go inside the compound for another queue, kids and parents started running in, ignoring the initial queue. It was frustrating. The show lasted 28 minutes. The other attractions we tried were Tarzan's tree house, Disneyland railroad, It's a small world, The many adventures of Winnie the Pooh (not worth the hour long queue), Slinky Dog Spin and Mickey's PhilharMagic (nice 3D show). By afternoon, more people turn up, leading to long queues at all the attractions. Some additional information:1. Avoid the fried noodle from the stalls if possible.2. Download the Disneyland apps. It provides information on queue time and also rides that may not be opened. We found out beforehand that Hyperspace Mountain was not available when we were there. 3. Queue wisely. Sadly there are always individuals who try to cut queue discreetly.4. Toilets are well maintained and clean. ",4
Visited with younger son. He enjoyed the most and was taking pictures with his favorite cartoon characters.   It is easy to reach by public transport (sky train).,4
"Well   . visiting Disney Land for the first time itself sounds absolutely Thrilling!!It   s kind of more for kids and family entertainment. It was an amazing experience for us though. But for hard core rides & coaster lovers I guess this place won   t work for u guys. However, reaching there wasn   t a task for us as we stayed on Lantau Island itself and the journey from hotel to the park was too short coz our hotel provided shuttle to Disney land which got us there in just 15     20 mins, while people travelling from other places will take more time than usual but its hassle free, MTR which is the second best option I would suggest, because while returning we missed our shuttle, we had to travel through MTR and it was a nice experience.The fountain of Mickey on a giant whale was quite welcoming. Especially kids, you could see the excitement in them watching those Disney characters. There was a live Mickey and Mini interaction when we entered and clicking pics with them which gave a kick start to the day. The rest of the rides were nice and we enjoyed a lot. Also, would suggest to make proper use of maps and the timings mentioned on it for the rides so that you don   t miss any being Sunday the wait time was not more than 15     20 mins.One small disappointment for us was the food coz being an Indian we would prefer Asian or Indian meal but we couldn   t found any options other than European food, especially after those tiring activities anyone would wish to have a meal of their choice. Also, the Indian restaurants that were shown on map were all shut and there was no update regarding the same coz it was far and we had to search walking which was very time consuming.But at the end the very famous Disney Fireworks (09:00 pm) a not to be missed stuff, is a treat to the eyes and it makes you forget the entire day   s tiredness.Over all experience was wonderful and would really suggest to visit once in your life.",4
"compared to paris disneyland   very chinese, mostly in a good way, people were not too rude, attractions were not too simple, foods were GREAT. was a bit sad as the castle was under construnction   also very hong kong. very pleasant experience to spend a day with a friend.",4
Disneyland is always worth a visit. It is a small park and you should be able to visit the majority of the attractions on one day. I recommend to be early in the park as it get more crowded starting from lunch time. The park is clean and neat as you would expect it from any Disneyland.If you want to buy souvenirs then you should do so before 1:00 PM as you get a discount of 10%.The park is easy to reach by MTR.Have a happy time!,4
"I went with my friend 1 Feb 2018 and we are both mid 20's. Was cool to experience a Disneyland. Some good things: the wait times were fantastic. The most we waited for a ride would have been 30 minutes. The rides were all really well put together and bought the characters to life.  It's a small world  and the  Pooh Bear  were my personal favourites, plus make sure you wait around for the end of day parade the lights in this are amazing and very good.Some not so great points: food variety wasdon't amazing, there wasdon't a heck of a lot of vegetarian meal options and the snacks and meals were very expensive (I would recommend taking in a lot of food for snacks especially if you have kids). There weredon't enough characters throughout the park during the day. We only managed to see three characters, and we were there from open til close. Some of the park just looked a little bit tired and unpolished. Also some of the main characters were no where to be seen within the park and rides. Pocahontas is my fave Disney character and the only time I saw here was a small figurine in the  It's a small world  ride, also no merch for her. Apart from that it was an awesome day out and the highlight of our trip to Hong Kong!!",4
One of the smallest Disneylands we've visited but had all the Disney characresitics and the standards are second to none. You can get a two day pass which works out well if you wish to visit a second day. The castle and few more areas are closed for construction. Overall a good Disney experience and Iron man show was our hightlight. ,4
"Got offered a discount on entry. Is anyone in your party over 60. Ten years shy of that age, I took offence. I shouldn   t have. Terrific day our!",4
"Good experience. Children loved it. Can be done in a day unless you want to do every ride, which may not be the case. The only thing that was terrible was that there were absolutely no options for vegetarian food. Absolutely none except some corn. Now, if you   ve set up a world famous theme park, people from all over the world are going to come. There would be so many who may look for veg food. It   s not a localized theme park which will be visited by locals only. And in this part if the world visitors from India will be so many. Needs so more thought on that one !! But other than having to eat only corn all day the kids loved it. Please get the food variety right! ",4
We was very pleased with our visit. The attractions are very well designed and very impressive. It's very well laid out and easy to get around. We loved the characters however there should be more of them walking around because we only saw three. Only downfall is the obvious pricing.   4 for a can of Fanta. Come on Disney we paid   100 to get in you could at least make the prices better. Overall enjoyed it. Very expensive. ,4
"Very good to visit with your family especially with kids. You have to ready your shoes and feet as it would be whole day of walking. This was my second time to visit HK Disneyland and I noticed that there were new attractions. It will surely unleash the child in you. Bringing in of food is allowed as long as it is not a full meal. Chips, cookies, candies were okay. Drinks were also allowed. My tip is to buy water outside before going there as the price inside is much higher. Enjoy the day and wait until 7:30pm for the Grand Parade, It was worth the wait. Find yourself a good location to sit along the Main Street USA early as the whole street becomes full packed before the parade.",4
this is an experience to watch kids enjoy and see their faces light up. it is also and excitement for us adults and the fun never ends,4
"I say it is a good introduction to Disneyland.I was disappointed that there not as many characters as I expected and the lines to take photos with them were huge. The quickest one was about 5min in the morning to see Donald Duck.Small world was closed for maintenance.Most rides were a 10 to 20min wait. Was not unbearable.The lion King show was great!We went for 2 days, it was enough as we had young children.Was def worth going. ",4
This is my second disney experience becuse the first was TOKYO. I will never get tired of trying the rides however one day wasdon't enough to do all activities in Disneyland.. Make sure to get a FAST PASS..,4
Bought a combo ticket for 2 days. Well worth due to new attractions like ironman and toy story. 2 days is still not enough especially with kids. There were long que especially after lunch. Advisable to be there early. Not much difference whether you visit weekday or weekend. ,4
"We took the train from Kowloon to HK Disneyland at 9:30am and we got to the park at 10am. The bag check and ticket checking process was quite smooth. The day pass was quite pricey so you need to go early and stay till they close to make it worth it. Going there early during the week can avoid the crowds, which usually starts around 1pm. Even the place is small, there are still a good number of rides to play at the park. The kids wanted to see the castle and we walked down the main street to get to the rides. Our route was Main Street    Tomorrowland     Fantasyland    Toy Story Land     Adventureland. Had lunch at Starliner Diner...very expensive for low quality food! Some people brought snacks for their lunches. Wish we had done that too.Played a few more rides after lunch and we left the park at 6pm. Totally forgot about the traffic. The trains were packed!!! If you dodon't have a stroller but you have young kids, you can rent a stroller for HK$120 per day with HK$100 refundable deposit. There are many stroller parking areas which was very convenient.Tips: download the Disneyland HK app to see the waiting time for each ride. It's pretty accurate.",4
"Four people three generations all adults. Love this happy place! We live in the northeast part of US. Visited Disneyland and Disneyworld at Florida and CA many times. Each time involved plane ride and long traveling time and hotel expense. Not this one. It was so easy to get to! 40 minutes train ride and here it was! The last part of the train ride (the ride that dedicated to go to Disney) was a pleasant surprise: the cabin was decorated with playful color and lovely designed seats. Never seen before. And there were rides that were uniquely Hong Kong Disney too. We enjoy them all. Even my 80 years old mother in law got onto the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars twice! I am a clean freak and all facilities plus overall park maintenance earn high my marks. It was a weekday and a bit rainy. Not crowded, which contribute to the easy and relax and cleanliness. But not happy that some places were closed, such as the castle and small world and many restaurants. Plus no firework. That took one point away from rating. Oh try the turkey by the food stand at the main street. Not as good as in CA but good enough if you miss turkey. It was 3 times bigger than the display. Do not let the display fool you. Finally have to praise all the workers. They were very professional and pleasant and did the right thing when they saw people cutting line.",4
"This is the 5th Disneyland I have been to. Once again it   s an unmistakable Disney experience but it   s quite small relative to other Disney   s.I guess we were in the off season (January) but we only waited for more than 10 minutes on one ride (Parachute Drop was 20 mins), but most were less than 5 mins.As for characters there was a queue to meet Mickey Minnie and Donald on Main Street. But we waited only a couple of minutes to meet the princesses at the 11am appearance (Cinderella & sofia) and Winnie Eeyore.I guess the downside of going in the off season is the risk of ride closures for maintenance which for us included the castle and one of our favourite rides   Small World   as well as a couple of other attractions.One of the highlights was the Mickey & the Wondrous Book Show. The Fairy Tale Forest was sweet. And the best ride was the Runaway Mine Cars.The parade was quite quick (seemed shorter than usual).Don   t bother with the Disney Railroad.",4
"Dodon't know if it the weather had anything to do with it (overcast with showers) but my Disneyland experience wasnt as happy and sunny as I expected. The place was terrific, of course: wonderful ambience, castles, great rides for the kids, meet and greets with Star Wars stormtroopers and Chewbacca, plus a parade of Disney stars. Even the food at the cafe was better than expected. I think I was expecting the staff to be a little...warmer. sunnier. Friendlier. I mean, this is Disneyland! Shoulddon't they be a little less..brisk? And much more like people working in a place of dreams and magic? But dont get me wrong, they were professional and courteous. Maybe I was just expecting the Disney spirit to be really strong here. Still it was a pleasant experience and I still hope to go back again some time.",4
Nice experience for children. Small compare to Paris.  Can do it in one day went December 2017. Beautiful christmas lights. Must stay until night fall to see the beautiful lights,4
"It   s a good venue to experience. The park as in all Disney parks is crowded. Nevertheless, despite the long wait for rides, it   s still a nice place to visit.",4
"Hong Kong Disneyland is smallest Disneyland in the world. But it doesdon't mean unattractive. Several new attraction were added since first time opening. Need walk about 3 minute from parking lot to main entrance. By walking slowly, it doesdon't seem so hard.Since I came during high season, Hong Kong Disneyland was crowded by tourist. Moreover, although larger and newer Shanghai Disneyland had opened, popularity cadon't be diminished in one seconds. When I'm across several popular attraction, long queue can be seen clearly. Merchandise store that not so large invaded by huge amount of tourist.Despite these, the attraction and fabulous parade can forget long queue issue. I'm enjoy so much during that time.I'm glad to see concern and priorities among disabilities. Wheelchair user will get priorities to enter attraction without should wait for a long time. Must be appreciated. My parent chose to lunch at outside Disneyland, considered most of restaurant were pricey. So I cadon't reviewed about it.To experience all attraction without long queue, come at low season or weekday. ",4
"Having been to the Disneys in the US, my expectations were high, but i was wrong. Had a very pleasant time at the park. It still had the disney vibe. Perhaps u was lucky with the season of my visit, but there were no hoards of PRCs.  The stand out was the Lion King performance for us. The evening parade was nice too. And who doesnt like fureworks? Definitely worth a visit.",4
"Pretty great place, been to a lot of Disney parks already. Not the biggest but was still a pretty good experience for the most part. Fast pass was complementary for 3 rides so that was good. Generally pretty clean as well. 1 star: The general train service was pretty slow. Should be able to operate much faster and less wait time.Souvenir shop wait at emporium was really long. Had about 11 customers waiting and only 2 cashiers and 1 cashier was checking out 6 bags of goods for a customer. More fast pass options would be nice to save everyone   s time overall.All in all was good. Recommend for kids and will be back next time we are in Hong Kong ",4
"Got 2 days ticket, we visit 25Jun2017 and 28Jun2017. At that moment we feel very hot. Sunshine so bright, no cloud and soo hot.Everything were so fun for our children, and we mostly sure all the attraction can not finish just only one day.  Good attraction  Have to enjoy all the attraction, except roller coaster :)  Best to see is the parade and fireworks at the evening  Very hot at summer  In most cases, restaurant and food quite expensive  Long queue in every attraction, but use express ticket much better",4
"We all had a fun day around Disneyland HK. We came at past 10am on a Friday with our entrance tickets bought from Klook. It was an instant savings of $100 for a group of six.A must go. Lines were long for the populars but worth it. The others which are not as popular, aka no lines such as photo ops with Chewy were great too. As there was nobody after us, kids were able to have more time with Chewy.",4
We spent 1 and a half days here and we all loved it. Our first experience of Disney as a family had all that we wanted as we did not want to spend days queuing! Our son (age 9) got to do his Star Wars on stage and our daughter (age 7) did her princess bits. There are only 4  big  rides and we queued less than an hour each time so gave us plenty of time to actually see our surroundings rather than queue all the time.For us it was a brilliant introduction to Disney and we all had an amazing time.,4
"This is 2nd time I visit Disneyland HK with my family. What can I say? After all this is Disney, so everything is very nice, very organized and build for family. However I also feel like everything getting more expensive inside. We spend more than HK$600 for dining for 5 persons (2 adults, 3 kids), toys are expensive also... queues were long for most of the rides, need 2 days to try almost all of the rides, yet still not tried all of them. This is definitely park for children under 12 yrs old. Maybe for older kids 2nd time visit will be a bit boring already. But other than that, staff were friendly, we enjoy a lot the new Iron man rides, and Hyperdrive Starwars ride.",4
One Day tour is just enough for us to go around the park. But we were not able to try all the rides as we had started a little bit late. We didn   t saw the parade as well because we were caught up with last show of the lion king. Too bad we didn   t have the fireworks as well. ,4
"We got a 2 day pass for HK Disney over Christmas week.It is very easy to get to via public transport and the train to the park has a great Disney theme to start things off.The park itself is quite big and has a lot to do. It can be a long day with the parade around 19:30 and fireworks around 21:00. A 2 day pass is ideal as it can get very crowded and due to the long queues for rides, you might not get to do everything in 1 day.There are a few opportunities to get photos with Disney characters, but we expected to see more like in the Paris Disney,",4
"The happiest place in the world and kids friendly, consider to pay for fast track access due to long queue, it worthed it.",4
"Myself and my partner went to Disney HK as it was rated top attraction on most websites. And it did not disappoint. The staff toys at the park were awesome and full of fun and energy. The attractions are set up well and the park flows as you walk round it into the different areas.The food was good, a bit over priced but that was expected with the place you are in.There are parades at set times in the day that are a must watch, these are fun and you get to see all the cast of the movies that are in the show and there is a dance element to it that really blends in with the culture in HK.Only thing that was a let down when we were there was that there was alot of construction going on so a few parts of ths park were missed out so it wasnt great.All in all. It is a must visit when in Hk.",4
"We had a great day at Hong Kong Disneyland, so much fun for all ages. The park was easy to get to, on the Disneyland line. Although smaller than the European and American Disneyland, there was plenty of rides, shows and attractions. We hardly had to queue for a ride all day, the most we queued was 20 minutes! Which I   m sure is unheard of at some Disney Parks!The light parade at night time and firework display were brilliant. Great day out!",4
"If you can only spare 1 day to visit and have young kids in tow, this Disneyland coulddon't be more perfect. With a footprint much smaller than the Anaheim or Orlando locations, even the furthest more points of the park are no more than a 20 25 minute walk from each other, even with a tired child in tow. We had heard from friends who are Disney enthusiasts that the rides at the HK location had more advanced technology (ergo would be funner) than their much older cousins in Anaheim and Orlando. This was not the case   we discerned no difference between HK and the Orlando location, the latter of which we had visited only 3 years earlier. The smaller scale of the park is best reflected in Main Street (considerably shorter than Orlando) and the diminutive  Magic Castle  (w a much smaller size compared to Orlando) almost made me laugh out loud. In any event, there was plenty to do and despite making use of all three (3) of the park's  fast passes , we literally found ourselves hurrying from ride to ride during our 11am 8pm visit.If you are anywhere within walking distance of an MTR stop, definitely consider taking the train to from Disneyland. From Central or Kowloon, you simply take the orange line to Sunny Bay then transfer to the Disney dedicated shuttle train.Disney's policy prohibits  food and alcohol  and contains considerable restrictions on size of backpacks and strollers. We saw no attempt by Disney security to enforce these restrictions. They did indeed search bags but only the main compartments of backpacks and purses and it appeared solely to confirm there were no large scale weapons. If I had to do over again, I would not hesitate to pack plenty of food and snacks (not surprisingly food at Disney is expensive!) and to bring our child's full size stroller so that he was not as tired fussy towards end of day evening. Disney also has a bag drop office located outside of security so in the unlikely event you encounter an overzealous security guard you can always leave your giant stroller or cooler full of food there. Tips Suggestions  Dodon't hesitate to bring your own food drinks  Stroller bag size restrictions dodon't appear to be enforced  If you arrive at opening, start with the rides furthest away from entrance (you'll likely face no line), then work your way back towards the entrance  Both the afternoon evening mainstreet parades are worth seeing, the evening parade includes lots of lots of neon lighting.",4
"It   s always so much fun to go to Disney and this time was not an exception. It   s a small park (in comparison to Orlando) but still there were all the great parades, street performances, rides and shows you find at Disney. Prices were a bit    Hong Kong    like but that was expected. There was however problem with the WiFi. That did not help if you wanted to use the app (which usually had wrong queue times). We enjoyed the fact that we could go there with the MTR and it   s a relatively quick ride from HongKong island. ",4
"We visited the place with 2 children aged 5 and 1. Fortunately we been abled to play all the games with both of them. The most amazing thing was the shows, we the adults enjoyed it maybe more than the kids. The stores around the place forces you to pay souvenirs and toys unlimited. The downside of this visit was the employee, they didn   t even smile to us, not really helping. And the weather was very hot but the good thing was the waiting area to the games full with fans. ",4
I hope Disneyland has more Indian food options in the future. Tahitian terrace was temporarily closed. Overall it as an amazing experience.,4
"Disneyland Hong Kong is spotlessly clean, well laid out and great fun. I confess to being a little disappointed with the food outlets. They are not consistent with the quality on offer in LA. I was also disappointed in the Mansion. The Haunted House in LA is much better. Space Mountain, however, was FABULOUS. I loved the special effects. Strongly recommend a visit. Jan Lindrum",4
"I am the one who really likes amusemet park. Planning to go to Hongkong makes me planing to go to Disneyland as well. I got recommendation from my friend who work in Hongkong to go there.Overall, its a really nice experience to go there, but after comparing to some other amusement park, Disneyland Hongkong isnt that big as you think. And there are no really 'extreme' activity except this big grizzly rides.",4
"Being a 90s kid, watching the likes of the Lion King, Toy Story, and Tarzan, visiting Disneyland brought me back to the 90s.So much variety, from rides, to food, to merchandise and photos with mini and mickey mouse, Disneyland Hong Kong has something for all ages (But mostly for children). Mad sure to book online prior to arrival, you may enter the park with online QR code tickets (this helped as I diddon't have to line up to get tickets. Arrived around 12:30pm, on the Disneyland train which was exciting. Line up to get into the park was short, once I was in, the park was packed. With park entry you are entitled to receive three fast track entries to any ride, you must go to the ride and scan your ticket in the fast track lanes and come back when the ticket advises you too.Made sure I grabbed an English language map then took the train within the park to check out the entirety of the venue which gave me an idea of what was in the park. Visited the Iron man and star wars ride within tomorrow land, the jungle river cruise, the  its a small world after all  ride, and Tarzan's tree house. Took a photo with Minnie and Mickey Mouse (Had to line up for over an hour).Make sure you stay until 9:00 pm for the fireworks at the parks close. Merchandise is expensive just like any other theme park and or zoo. Food is also expensive, but there is variety depending on the area you are in. Tomorrow land had burger and chip meals, near the jungle river cruise their is Asian foods. Throughout the park there is a number of pop up stands which sell ice creams, hot dogs, popcorn, drinks and snacks. I was really surprised with the waiting lines for rides, although it seems at first you may have to wait a while, the lines move quick and if the sign at the ride says a 60 minute wait realistically, for me it was a 35 minute wait which was good. Sadly diddon't get to see alot, because there is so much to do, so I recommend getting a two day pass. Try get there an around 10:30am when the park opens, time flys when you are having fun.I had a great experience, Disneyland Hong Kong is a place you must go and visit.",4
"great place for kids ... rides range from average to good ... best rides i would recommend are the star wars , miner cars , mystic manor, hot wheels ...the distance on the maps is misleading .... places in reality are closer to each other ... walking shoes a must although they have strollers for kids on hire ... great place for family fun time together",4
"A great day out with the family. I   ve now been to all the Disney parks and there is no need for multiple days at this one. As usual, the park is clean, service is great, the rides are fun, and the cheers from your kids will make it worth every penny. If your in the area and have your kids, you   ve got to go.",4
"I'm damn disappointed while facing Castle on maintenance and I'm visiting on 2nd Jan 2018, and this is my first time visit but unfortunately no fireworks.",4
"Based on Disney land in the US, but not as big. Recommend get there early before the crowds and pick what rides you want to get on without too long a wait. Once the crowds get there around 11.00am the wait can be up to 45 minutes to get on certain rides. Wide selection of activities and all included in the entrance fee. Great for kids and older people young at heart.",4
"Spend a day at HK Disney and enjoy the magical land.... Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain, Iron Man Adventure, Toy Story Land, many parades, many charactersThe staff is always happy and professional in character. The Main Street is filled with shops for shopping and more shopping. It is not as crowded as other Disneys around the world. Yet it has enough attractions to last a day. Use the FastPass to better manage the queue times. ",4
"We were visiting Hong Kong for a week and thought it'd be worth a shot to try out Disneyland there. We weredon't expecting big, and we expected it might be a bit different from Florida, but thought it would be a great one day out. The rides were great, especially Hyper Space Mountain and all the Star Wars theming of Tommorwland. The food was pretty good. The lack of all the princess stuff was a nice bonus. It was easy to get to from Causeway Bay and the restaurants had plenty of space. We never had to queue more that 15 minutes for any ride (it wasdon't a holiday there). On the negative side, that castle is comically small, no Pirates of the Caribbean ride and the shops are unbelievably crowded. Would recommend for a day out, not for a whole week.",4
"We arrived at 10.00 and there already long queued at ticket counter. I suggest buying ticket from website so you do not have to wasting time for queue.The newest ride was iron man exhibition.Young children were allowed to play almost all the ride, even the space mountain roller coaster.The staff was working quick and efficient, so even the queue are long, the waiting time was short.Do not forget use your fast pass.Restaurants were over crowd during lunch and dinner time.While you taking the mtr for going back, please kindly arrange your schedule, most visitors going back after the parade show. So avoid that time, it was over crowded.Overall, my daughter enjoyed the park very much.",4
Hong Kong Disneyland is perfect for young kids. The rides are suited for young kids.   Lion king show was great and worth waiting for.,4
"I live in the US and I enjoy how the Disney brand is interpreted in its sites abroad. I loved the unique experience thought that the shows were world class. As with any Disney experience, I recommend getting there when they open, go on all the ride that you'd like to do (to avoid lines) because it gets crowded quickly. ",4
"a nice orderly place, with lots of rides, suitable for different ages; staff are friendly and able to speak English;",4
"While much smaller than its Tokyo counterpart, and with lots of overlap in rides, it more than made up for it, for an English speaking family, by the strong mix of languages at shows etc.  The Lion King performance was a standout on the day.",4
"Abt 40mins from Kowloon via MTR. Cool disney train from Sunny Bay to Disneyland station (just 1 stop).Purchased entrance tix & mealsvia Klook which was useful. No need to queue at tix counter. Head straight to turnstile, gain entry & exchange your meal vouchers after gaining entry.Smaller area with shorter queues compared to Tokyo. Iron man ride was an enjoyable. Son also enjoyed the Jedi training which you have to register at the gift shop next hyperspace mountain. Make good use of the fastpass where possible (mainly for hyperspace, iron man & winnie the pooh rides). Toy story land was nice. The castle is relatively small & not accessible. The 2 parades were good (shorter than Tokyo), highlight was Lightning McQueen and Mac truck.Lots of food option & very expensive.Capped off the night with fantastic fireworks display. Be prepare for long queue if you're taking the train back.",4
It   s a nice visit but there are just too many people. Every places required long queue especially eateries.,4
"Plan your day with maps on hand, cover Star Trek, Iron Man, Loin King Show. Dodon't miss the parade both in the day and night. Perfect getaway for your family day out. Loads of rides and activities for both adults and kids.",4
It's Disneyland! Entertainment and Fun Standards are well maintained.Pros  Less crowded (compared to Tokyo Disney)  Smaller so not so exhausted exploring it  Food is not too bad hereCons  Not much info on which character appears where  underwhelming (short) Parade  some shows been there since the start  as usual we only get to take photos with Mickey Mouse when not in Disneyland LOL,4
"We had one day in HK and decided to spend it at Disneyland based on reputation. I must admit   we diddon't know what to expect, but based on the movies   it seemed as a must visit. The place is massive   but definitely more geared towards the family experience and young ones. The rides were fun but not exhilarating. Also expected more of the characters to be visible Entry fee is of course sky high   thus as a value for money attraction   would not recommend.All in all Disneyland has been ticked off the bucket list   but a bittersweet experience.",4
"As in any famous theme park, and add to that the peak Christmas travel season, there are a lot of people everywhere!!! But it does not matter... For major rides, take advantage of the FastPass. I found this very helpful. All staff are graceful and helpful, despite that they had to work extended hours and even if there are really lots of people visiting that day. Very organized and efficient during the parades. Note though that fireworks will no longer be shown after 1 Jan 2018, so lucky me that I made it before that.. to have a magical experience to witness the last few fireworks display.",4
Easy excess.. rented the pram for my girl. Cost 200hk(100hk depo).   Very limited rides for young kids.. so only manage to walk around and enjoy the deco and halal food was good. Costly as usual.,4
"Disneyland Hong Kong really doesn   t offer the variety of rides that would appeal to an adult and older children. Rides like grizzly gulch, hyperspace mountain and Rc racer are highlights. However it seems that many of the rides are toned down for Hong Kong audience. The park is a 1 day endeavour and is easily navigated. Staff as always demonstrate the qualities of the Disney brand. The park really needs to improve adventure land as it fails to offer anything of substance. Park is clean and functions efficiently ",4
"I took my wife and daughter to Hong Kong Disneyland while on a Christmas holiday. We are avid fans and have been to Tokyo Disney, Disneyland California and Disney World at least 50 times so we decided we couldn   t miss Hong Kong.This park is the smallest and most suitable for younger children but there are some unique features. There are only (4) thrill rides in the park. In our opinion the Runaway Mine Train was the best. Think Thunder Mountain but with a few twists. Hyperspace Mountain is a small scale version of Space Mountain and will appeal to fans of that ride in the US. The Iron Man Ride is a simulator and very good. Mystic Manor is a must see! It   s a hyped up and fun version of the Haunted Mansion and the technology and special effects are amazing!There are limited food options through the park compared to US parks but quality is very good.We visited on a Friday and crowds were manageable. Never waited more than 25 minutes despite posted wait times of 45 60 minutes. ",4
We took our boys to Disneyland Shanghai last year and it was amazing. HK Disneyland was pleasant but there were not the thrilling rides. All in all it was fun to see some of our favourite characters and the Halloween parade was awesome. Highlight was the Lion King show   the performers were fabulous. ,4
"I have to say, I love Halloween and the best time to visit Disneyland for me is during this season. The dark parade is enough reason to stay and catch the glow in the dark spectacle of villains, monsters, and the Pumpkin King himself, Jack Skellington. I have yet to go to Disneyland during another season, so am sorry if this review isdon't much help :) the weather during this time is good enough to be out. Not too hot and not too cold. Plus the number of people weredon't that overwhelming. Still best to go early so youhave ample time to roam around, rest and recharge, and have a go at it.It will be a bit weird for English native speakers to watch Mickey Mouse and Co. speak Mandarin during some of the Live Shows but trust me it's no issue in the long run. There are subtitles on a screen either side of the stage. Apart from that the songs we all know and love are the same.",4
Not that big but will grow in the future.  Best for small kids or those that might not get to any other Disney facility.  All done in one day   or half a day for adults without kids.,4
"Our first visit to disneyland and it was magic although too noisy for our three year old. The music played everywhere which was part of the magic, however it got be too much for small ears. The shows, rides and all the settings where however amazing!",4
"Nice place to visit. The rides are fun. I went on a weekday so not too crowded. The food at Disneyland are nice but a bit pricey. All shops there are nice and well stocked with toys, souvenirs, utensils, stationery and snacks. The parade is wonderful and the fireworks in the evening is fantastic. ",4
Last visit is more than 10 years ago without kids. First visit to Disneyland for the kids and they are very excited about the trip. The park is definitely slightly much bigger than the last trip we in 2006 07 and a park that not only...More,4
"If you're going to Hong Kong defiantly check out Disneyland it's a great day out no matter what your age! The atmosphere is fantastic along with all the fun rides and entertainment. My visit was in may and the park was really quiet, the longest we waited for an attraction was about 20 mins! Incredibly short waiting times made experiencing the park a breeze and we were able to go on the rides more than once. The entertainment was incredible, from the parades to the firework show! Getting to the park is super easy with Hong Kings train system, the trains are super efficient, cheap, clean and safe, I stayed in Kowloon east and it took under an hour to get there, taking 2 trains both only about a 10  15 minute journey and then taking the Disneyland train which is an experience in itself. Definitely recommend and the best way to travel is with an octopus card which you scan when you enter the station and scan again once you arrive at your destination. ",4
"parks are well maintained. Staff are friendly.   In comparison with Tokyo disneyland, this park is relatively small and have less games.  if you plan properly, you can play most of the games within a day.   The toys in the shops are expensive.",4
"Enjoyed a day here with my 10 month old grandson and his mum. Lots of rides for small folk and shows galore! Didn   t stay for the firework display as 6 hours of Disney music is enough for a lifetime!!! But definitely worth a visit, easy to access via MTR. Baby changing facilities were good, merchandise galore, just wish there were one or two quiet areas!! ",4
"Went to Hong Kong Disneyland with apprehension as heard very little park compared to American parks, still managed to enjoy not as many adult rides but still enjoyable , queues were far shorter than USA   ticked the third park off list , fireworks in evening still worth the wait  will have to return after park made bigger, good train link to park",4
I felt this is more for Kids than youth. hence you have kids than only visit this place else better go to Ocean Park.,4
"I went to Disneyland with other adults, no children in our group. It's a fabulous day out with excellent facilities and really fun activities. My favourite was the StarWars space mountain and I highly recommend the Grizly Mountain Minecars. The LionKing show was wonderful as well. My unexpected highlight was the Iron Man experience. Over all Disneyland should not be missed on a trip to HongKong.",4
We had to go to Disney as soon as our grown up daughters knew there was a Disney here. It was a weird experience as the locals were constantly taking pictures off all 6 of us as we were the only whites there. Great place to spend the day though.,4
"If you like California Disneyland you   ll love Hong Kong Disneyland with its similar compact size. The park is laid out in the same pattern as its California counterpart   pass through Sleeping Beauty   s castle to enter Fantasyland, turn right for Tomorrowland, etc. Of course, there are key differences that make this park special, including hearing instructions in Cantonese before English, watching mainly Chinese cast members perform, and dining at restaurants featuring a variety of Chinese and Japanese items along with American hamburgers. It is at once a fun and cultural experience.My two favorite rides were The Iron Man Experience, a motion simulator movie ride that has Iron Man saving downtown Hong Kong Island, and Mystic Manor, a high tech reimagining of The Haunted Mansion. But no ghosts appear in this through the dark ride. Instead it retells the weird stories of explorer Lord Henry Mystic and his too curious pet monkey Albert. There are surprises funny and scary at every turn.The stage performances are top quality, including    Festival of the Lion King    with special effects, choreography, and singing on par with    The Lion King    on Broadway. My only letdown was the Iron Man Showcase when the hostess began by announcing    Our presentation will be Cantonese    and began to explain the various projects without one word of English. I was completely lost. Fortunately when Iron Man spoke, his words were only English. (Did this confuse the largely Chinese crowd?) A day   s visit here is worth the time, and you probably can do everything in one day if you come when the park opens and play all day, enjoying lunch and dinner on site.",4
Just a quick stop off before heading to Australia. When I saw HK had a DisneyLand I had to go. I   ve not been to Disneyland in any other country so was so excited. Easy to get to. Very well sign posted on the tubes. Loved that it was Christmassy. Rides very good. Not many big scary rides. Perfect for me as I   m a wimp. Staff friendly. Lion King show amazing. Singing and dancing so talented. Caramel Popcorn was a nice treat. Only let down was the food. We had burger and chips. Chips nice slightly warm but burger was cold and tasteless. ,4
Visited with wife and two kids 5 and 9 years old. There is a lot to do and see. We had fun. We did one day so we did not get to see everything. The long queues are well managed and move fast. Good crowd management. Shops are a bit pricey. The night show is a must see! It was awesome! ,4
We had a good time in Disneyland     WHO DOESNT ; ).. it was all decked up for the holiday season.. The rides were all suited for kids and my 5 year old loved the Ironman exhibit and the 4D show (we did that twice).. and so also the grizzly roller coaster ride. The rides here have a smaller height requirement and most of the rides can be done by kids.. Over the day the park sure gets crowded although we went on a weekday to beat the crowd.. I recommend that study the park before you go.. and identify the rides you want to take FOR SURE types so that you get to them ASAP and avoid long queues.For example by the end of the day the Carousel queues were really long and we skipped that.. You can consider getting fast pass too.. (we didnt).DONT MISS the Disney parade that happens at 3PM or the time they keep announcing.. And the highlight for us was the night parade.. This was the first time we were seeing it (don   t remember seeing it in Paris or US) and we were floored with it.. Its something you GOT TO WATCH to see the    Magic   .Found it better than the fireworks too.. Beat that!!All in all.. good fun.. if you are in HK and have kids (well even otherwise) .. it   s worth a visit.. but if you have been to other Disney   s you might find it smaller.,4
"It was not crowded when we went near end November. The park was clean and smoke free! The rides exclusive to Hong Kong Disneyland was enjoyable.. the mountain train ride is a must try!Though some of the eateries were not opened, the queue to buy food was cleared very quickly. If you want to go shopping, I   d suggest you get it done first and make use of the delivery to park entrance service( free of charge). That   s because the shops are very crowded in the evening!",4
"Spent 2 weekdays @Disneyland and there was lesser people now.  This is my 3rd visit in 10 years.  Good for family and my children enjoyed it.  Not much changes over the years, except for 'Tomorrowland'.",4
"If Hong Kong is near to your country and would like your children to experience Disneyland for the first time, you can try this place. It will cost you less and your children will definitely enjoy this place. As compared to Disneyland parks in US and Europe, this is a smaller version in terms of scale but for your children it will be equally enjoyable and memorable. From Hong Kong Central station going to HK Disney is very easy and convenient. Just be sure you have wisely budgeted your money specifically for this trip as the cost will not be as cheap as you would think, it is going to be an experience though for your kids.",4
"We took a guided tour to Disney, so we were dropped off by a guide and then returned ourselves by MTR. If we were to do this again, we would make our own way there via the MTR (easy to navigate)Disney Hong Kong is quite small, and there are not many thrill rides, but it was still a great atmosphere. We stayed for the fireworks at 8pm which were spectacular, and the fake snow really put a magic touch on the show. Highly recommend staying to see this. Unfortunately we have been to Disneyland in America so found ourselves comparing.We went on a Thursday so there was almost no queues, although a lot of people in the park, I suspect on a weekend or holiday the place gets very busy.",4
"Its a theme park based on world of Disney. Not big enough as Florida Disneyland, but a single day outing is sufficient. Kids will have fun here. Parade is better here.",4
"Truly the happiest place to be in with all those colorful parades, familiar cartoon and fairy tale characters dancing around with their bright colored costumes. The place was really massive so it involves a lot of walking and running as well. Lines are long for the rides. But I hardly saw some stalls selling snacks or something to eat. There are some restos but I think it   s expensive. Maybe it   s just me. In the evening when you   ll all tired from walking and you want something hot to eat because it   s already getting cold outside, you come across this eating joint where they serve good food but the place is not well lit. You can hardly see what you   re eating in the bowl.You should see the grand parade at night. It was really enjoyable. Sad to say, I missed the fireworks. Probably, I was tired and my energy was already spent for the day.",4
"It is nice and park for family. You can reach the park very easy by train.  Recommend to bring your own food if you want to save some buck.  As the food there is expensive, most of the ride have long waiting time.",4
"You can check the weather before you are planning travelling to Hong Kong. We brought entrance tickets from KLOOK APP which is easier and have discounts for online booking. You can spend all day in Disneyland and night time you can watch the fireworks at night time. P S : you can bring clothes for exchange if you going to play water park games, umbrella or raincoat. And also, you may book your lunch time with KLOOK APP and buy their lunch package is much save more money for family trip. ",4
"We have just returned from Hong Kong and have spent 2 days in Disneyland. November is a great time to visit, the weather is cool and it does not coincide with any China or Hong Kong holidays so the park is not crowded.Our plan was to complete as many rides on the first day and then we look at taking pictures.We had skipped all photo taking opportunities with Disney Characters and headed straight for the Ironman experience. It took us 15 20 mins to get on the rides.The ride was great, and all my kids aged 11, 9 and 5 loved it.It definitely pays to stay in one of the Disney hotels as it allows you access to priority queue to enter Disneyland.After completing the rides in Tomorrowland, we moved on to Fantasyland where we had our lunch at the Royal Banquet hall. Dining within Disneyland is pricey and not worth the value but Royal Banquet hall is one of the best places to eat.After lunch we headed to Grizzly Gulch where the Big Mountain ride was what we feel the best ride of the day. it was a 30min queue but this is peanuts compared to the queues we had at Japan Disneyland.We moved on to Mystic Point where the only attraction worth mentioning is the Mystic Manor. The ride is interesting with a tinge of scary feel to it (it was enough to spook my 9 year old..in a good way) and created a bit of excitement to weary bodies late in the day.After dinner at the Bakery (as most places had long queues for dinner) we lounged around main street to snap photos of the neon lit buildings. We made our way to the center garden and waited for the Parade to start. It was more magical lights with our favourite characters. It was awesome to see Lightning McQueen and Mack and the other Disney characters such as Toy Story Characters, Belle and beast.Fireworks came after the parade and the whole main street was filled with artificial snow since its 1 month away from Christmas. The lights on the Main Street buildings were mesmerizing.We went back on Day 2 and joined the queue to have a snap with Mickey and Minnie. They were great and duly obliged with hugs and were patient but the queue took more than an hour. I have the luxury of my Mrs in the queue while I took the boys to wander the Main Street attractions such as riding on the Taxicab. They would not have stood well in the queue. If you have only one day in Disney I suggest you skip this.We explored Adventure land after lunch and went up Tarzan's tree house and went on the Jungle River Cruise.The one show you shoulddon't miss is the Festival of the Lion King in Adventure land. The performance is awesome and its not easy to keep my 5 year old engrossed in something that is not animated. We went back for 2nd rounds on some of our favourite rides such as Big Mountain, Mystic Manor and the Iron Man experience.We found some food trucks that serve packaged local fare outside Disneyland that is really affordable so that is where we ate for dinner on the 2nd day.",4
"This is our 4th time to Disneyland, likely going to be our last, since my son is reaching his teens and the rides are obviously losing its appeal to him. The new addition: Mystic Manor, Star Wars ride and Iron man   s Stark Tower ride, the first is identical to that of Orlando   s, while the other two are pretty new to me. However the 4D effect is slightly worse off than those in USS, not a adrenaline pumping. The rest, more suitable for younger kids. Oh one thing, they have shifted the fireworks to 6.30pm (maybe coz its winter), and the location is at the fountain, not at the sleeping beauty   s castle. ",4
"Our family 3 rd visit to Hong Kong Disneyland, with the new features such like Ironman, Star Wars, most enjoyable in the park still are my 2 kids",4
"Disneyland for me is a fairy land, magical kingdom and a eye opening experience for an amusement park. The facility is well prepared and well thought so that every theme of area is excited to go to and giving pleasure and joy especially for kids. You can explore 7 land like Adventure Land, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, Toy Story Land, Fantasy Land, Tomorrow Land and Main Street, USA which is filled with beauty, excitement and Disney Characters. At night you can see the parade of Disney Characters and fireworks.",4
We loved experiencing attractions we had never seen at Disney World or Disneyland California.  It was also fun noticing small differences in attractions that the American parks have.,4
Made a last minute decision to go Disneyland after lunch.  Conveniently took the MTR to Disneyland from my hotel. Notice theme park have renovated most of the places.  Looks new and clean.  Good place to spend a bonding session with my daughter.,4
"It was a bad time to go to Disneyland in June. Or rather to go to hongkong in June is a pretty bad idea. Heavy downpour, stop, heavy downpour again. A pity that I wasn   t able to get to watch the parade.However, I probably won   t go back again. ",4
"A little smaller than i thought, we enjoyed ourselves and would have stayed for the end if we had time but the fireworks are said to be am amazing sight!!  Some good rides, and the goldmine train is a must!!",4
"Went with family and we were not disappointed. Up to the standard of all Disney parks with the inevitable parade at the end.   You take the special Disney themed train on the resort line from Sunny Bay station. All in, a great day out.",4
"Took the cute disney train from Sunny Bay and the journey to the theme park is seamless.Mascots are very lively and really helps bring the mood of all ages up.Most rides are suitable for kids, with height restrictions for some of the rides.The two parades are awesome, amazed with the evening    Paint The Night    parade. Fireworks is quite disappointing, with few climax, but it   s saddening to hear about the ceasation of the fireworks coming 02.01.2018.Christmas theme is complete with a tall christmas tree at the main street, U.S.A. area.Overall, a great experience!",4
It is huge and spread in big chunk of land.One day is surely not enough to enjoy the rides and characters present.But worth visited.,4
This is a state of the art theme park living up to the disneyland brand . The rides are nice too. Staff are friendly . The parade is likewise the high light of the theme park. Going there is easy ying the sub ways.,4
"Hong Kong's must place visit and children's paradise. This place has all the attractions including shows, swings, shops, eating joints. The tickets price ranges 525 hkd or above for adult and ranges 375 hkd for age group 3 11 years. Weekends have good amount of waiting time for each ride which is around 30 40 minutes so be patient. Well connected thru public transport. Drop at Sunny bay MTR station and take the Disneyland MTR. This MTR is best in looks as it has showcased cartoon characters with very comfortable seats. We missed the parade as it was whole day raining but dodon't miss it and also cover fire works at night around 8 clock. ",4
"Small but with enough things for us to do with a 1.5yo kid for a full day. She took Its a Small World, Winnie the Pooh and all the performances. I   m very happy that she enjoyed most of it. I managed to go for the Iron man ride and hyperspace ride. Only missed out on my rolling thunder train one... As for food wise, it   s Disney pricing but at least it does not taste too bad. Went on a Monday and there isn   t a lot of queuing which is a life saver. Side note, if it rains, there is not many places that you can find shelter so please bring a brolly or raincoat.. Unfortunately due to the rain there wasn   t the parade at night but we still got to watch the fireworks! Went there by Uber and went back by taxi (there is ample).",4
Nothing can be said about this place other than it is what you expect from the name. Lining up for rides and photo ops is the norm. Good that you can get the train directly to this one.,4
"It worked out good for us to be here on weekdays and also rainy day. We spent 2 days here on Monday and Tuesday and the wait times for the attractions were max 15 minutes which was totally different from our experience at Japanese DisneyLand. Though Japanese DL was so huge with Disney Sea, the waiting times were 2 hrs (cadon't believe it) So we had to skip most of the attractions at Japan. That is the not the case in HK and we were cruising from Attraction after attraction. Ofcourse, the size of HK Disneyland is small and we ran out of options so fast.Negative comments : After waiting for 30 minutes, Philharmagic show announced that the show was cancelled due to technical reasons and that was not good. They should have tested it well in advance before show begins and people queing up. Same happened with Iron man show, it snapped half way and they restarted again.",4
"We had a great day in Hong Kong Disney, the park is much smaller than other counterparts and can be done in a day. Food is probably the biggest letdown and very $$$.",4
"Take an umbrella and you'll be ok. Lines are under cover, but some attractions like meet the characters are not on. Parade was cancelled, but a good day out anyway. Havedon't been to any other Disneyland to compare. Access by train is easy.",4
"i thinks only kids can enjoey here, because all is not exciting for adult, and if you need take photo with disney doll, you must to line up for long time   ",4
"As a fan of Disneyland, this park will give you that joy, however it's quite small and too overpriced for what you get.",4
"Full day of walking, we'll set out, much like Movieworld in Australia, with a train that goes around the whole of the property, but you can really only see the garden from the train, not the attractions, useful for getting back to the front gate. We stayed until mid afternoon, there were 2 parades during that time, both were good with a lot of sing and dancing. Heaps of souvenir shops line the main walk way. We watched a 3D movie and saw a stage production. Both were quite good. They do need more seating around the area not just at the eateries. ",4
"We had a full day at Disneyland. It was mid week and off peak and so crowds were at a comfortable number. Queues were short. However the number of restaurants open was about half. Which seriously limited our meal options. Souvenirs were over priced particularly specific items related to Hong Kong. Each area had a large shop with related items. It seemed that shopping was almost the priority. Characters were few and far between, emerging only for photo appointments. They diddon't wander and mix and mingle. ",4
"My first ever disneyland trip after 4 decades. My 9 year old first experience on magical land too. First time is never forgetful. So yes, we enjoyed much though there are bigger & better ones in other places but we shall never forget our first was in Hong Kong :P",4
"This Disney Park is small by CA & FL standards but it was just right for our 5 & 7 year olds. They had a ball as wait times for rides were short and at night they felt like they had the park to themselves. The park is clean and friendly. Kudos to all the cast members who endured the heat and humidity with endless patience and smiles, especially those in costumes and parades. Our longest wait was to visit with Cinderella who could not have been more gracious and kind to our kiddos. She had to be melting under her gown, wig, and makeup but she took great care to give each guest her undivided attention. All of the live shows were excellent entertainment! The Lion King was quite wonderful. We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel so we were able to break up our day, rest a bit, and return in the evening for uncrowded rides and a spectacular fireworks show. In my heart, there   s no DL like the original but HK Disney has its own special charm.",4
"Bought my kids here for sight seeing as the weather start to get cool on early nov. Got the ticket as a package with booking of hotel. There are so many Mickey Mouse stuffs that exclusive to Disneyland only! My kids love max!!Too many item to list! Must come here yourself. There   s parade every few hour that u can sit on the road side to watch, it   s very very clean to sit on the road side or on the floor!! Please bring your kids here! No regret!",4
"We went to Hong Kong Disneyland in our visit to Hong Kong.The park is quite small comparing to the Tokyo Disneyland.The park is very organised and well signalised they always have announcements in English and not only in Chinese.We got to the park at 10am and we haven   t booked before but the queue was not so bad and we managed to go to the principal attractions, watch two parades and watch the fireworks.",4
"Diddon't open until 11amOnly 1 park section at a timeI miss the greatness of AnaheimNight parade magicalDay parade colourful and full of energy, the fire works amazingFast food just ordinary, however the one redeeming restaurant is The Park CafeLong walk from bus station to main gate, no disable assistance offered, quite a long walk",4
"Compared to US or European Disney parks this one is a steal at roughly    30 per person per day, food is reasonably prices considering you are a totally captive audience at around    15    20 for main courses. Highlights of Space Mountain, Toy Story parachutes and Mystic Manor went down a total storm with our kids as did the Lion King and 3d cinema. What nearly proved to be a disaster was accidentally locating the Elsa character greeting, completely hidden and that was what our daughter had been going to the park to find and went down less well was the one hour and 20 minute wait to get access to the Minnie and Mickey character greeting, a second set of characters elsewhere on park would resolve that for very little cost. On balance well worth a visit but some trouble shooting could get an extra star. ",4
"As always Disneyland is a fun day, and HK Disneyland was no exception. Although seems a bit smaller than others we visited. Food is expensive and not a lot of options.",4
"We had 2 day tickets travelling with 11 year old and 6 year old, staying at Explorers Lodge resort. First day we arrived at opening time and was exhausted by 5pm, in part due to the heat. Next day we split our day up and did morning and evening, utilising hotel shuttle buses. Wish we stayed an extra day or two and split it up from beginning. Food was reasonable compared to what we see in Australia. The vans outside the park on way to train station was fab as was look vouchers for lunches. Great value despite contrary advice",4
If you have a week in Hong Kong   HK Disneyland is a must to visit. Wonderful and Magical place for children and adults. I was disappointed that no Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean in HK Disneyland. Food Service staff needed to have more training to greet gusts and be polite. Some how Disneyland needed to work harder to make HK Disneyland be the Happiest Place in Hong Kong. Keep up the good work!,4
"It's the same verywhere. But DisneyLand has it's theme as the name suggests. The only proper, worth seeing attraction is the parade which happens around 7:oo pm in front of the castle. The rides are fit for kids from 5 10 years old. Teenagers who love the princesses can visit the garden and children lovin thrill can go to tooy story part. It's almost same as compared imagic in lonavla, but with lesser rides. ",4
"On a family holiday to Hong Kong we had two seniors, two adults and two young grandchildren so decided to split our time at Disneyland into two trips. Also tickets for adults were only around another $10 to book the extra day and less for Seniors. This worked well for our group. Some queuing but wasdon't too long but would not go on a public holiday or special event day. Check their calendar online. Lots of teens there but plenty of rides and attractions geared towards younger children as well..which suited us. Worth catching the parade. Too long a queue for Mickey and Minnie to have photos but the children did get to meet a couple of Princesses. Would recommend pre booking tickets.",4
"If you   re a Disney fanatic like me and you   ve been to the American parks, you might be a little let down by HK Disneyland. It   s much smaller and it has less attractions. In saying that though, there are still lots of things to try out and enjoy. The big grizzly mountain ride was a definite highlight! The parades were excellent too. ",4
this place is good for family with children or maybe couples that want to have flashback from childhood memory.  the place is huge...you might need 2 days to explore all the attractions.the food also good even though quite expensive.,4
"Having visited both the Disney parks in both Orlando and Los Angeles I would judge this one as on the smaller side. Apart from that it's a Disneyland with all the magic you would expect.Extra marks for the train that immerses you into the Disney magic even before you arrive.A few things that we noted that could be better though:* On our visit several restaurants were closed. We had to search quite long for restaurants that were not waaay to expensive. In my mind, eating at a Disney park doesdon't have the purpose of eating high class food, it's just about filling up energy quickly to get back into the park. If you need to close restaurants, please keep more of the lower priced ones open.* A little too much Chinese for an international park. For example, our 4 year old attended the Jedi academy and it was spoken a lot in chinese. Now, he doesdon't understand English either, but if it was in English we could have helped him better. Perhaps more separate events in Chinese and English?* Opening hours 10:30 to 20:00 is too short. I dodon't know why they chose to open so late and close so early, but isdon't most Disney parks in the US open until about midnight?",4
"I went on a weekday during off peak period (after the Golden Week) and the park was not so packed. Managed to get onto most of the rides within minutes, which was a good thing. Location was quite convenient coming from the airport. I think the roller coasters are manageable for adults and kids and the park has quite a variety of rides. A bit pricey but that's Disneyland. I would recommend to visit once if you have kids or if you have not been to Disneyland before. ",4
"We Booked on line, and were amazed that two 2 day tickets for seniors worked out at   35. It's reached on the final leg by a special Disney metro, with mouse shaped windows. The park is smaller than the Paris one, so can comfortably be done in 2 days. The Disney parades and night time fireworks are as good as the other parks. No haunted mansion, due to Chinese feelings about ghosts, but the Mystic manor made up for it. You dodon't get Korean Squid from the hot dog vendors in Florida.",4
"Disneyland is a must visit if you have kids travelling with you to Hong Kong. Go early as the queues to the rides can get very long, especially on weekends.",4
"We visited on a Saturday at around 130pm and stayed till 10pm. Buy tickets ahead of time to skip the ticket line. It was busy as expected and line for rides were at least 40 minutes. Food and drinks were expensive like any theme park ($28 32 HKD for bottled drinks and $30ish HKD for corn hot dog ice cream, etc). Snacks stalls do shut down in the evening. There are restaurants that remains open. Evening is the best, as the temperature is cooler and after 6pm or so, we were able to get on all the rides we wanted to as the wait times were anywhere from 0 to 20 minutes, except the night time stuff and kids rides in Fantasyland   lots of kids even at night! The rafts to the treehouse closes in the evening, but do go around 5 6pm to avoid standing in line. Part of Toy Story Land was also blocked off when we got there around 7pm ish. We saw fireworks at 8pm and parade at around 9pm. I've only been to Disney World in Florida. So, in comparison, this Disneyland is much more manageable as a day half day trip. It was a fun visit for us. ",4
"Our recent trip to Hong Kong was another testing the user friendly nature of holiday destinations for people in wheelchairs. And, I am pleased to say that Disneyland Hong Kong really did step up to the mark. On entry the staff (cast members they call themselves) pay attention to those in wheelchairs to make it easier to enter. Security and bag checks on entry provide a higher sense of safety in these troubled times. And, dodon't forget that when you go through the gate ask for the multiple entry stamp so that if you leave during the day you can come back again on the same day without the cost of another ticket. Also if you decide to come back for a second day it is cheaper to upgrade your one day pass to a two or multi day pass at the gate than to buy another ticket. Like all theme parks Disney land is not cheap, food is of poor quality and very expensive, drinks including bottled water are also very expensive. However, they do have rides that cater for people in wheelchairs. In all our travels we have not experienced this before. The park has a number of rides that have special carriages that allow the wheelchair to be loaded passenger and all onto the ride thus ensuring the whole family can enjoy the ride together. These rides are clearly marked on the theme park maps. Other good things about the park include abundant seating as there is a lot of walking to do and a lot of waiting for the young adults (Children) who are off on the roller coasters, etc. when mum and dad are worn out. The paths are easy to navigate even with the crowds and make the use of wheelchairs both manual and electric much easier. We went during the day and then came back at night to watch the fireworks. A tip here   they turn the lights out at night for the fireworks show which in the crush of people makes this a pick pockets paradise. Keep your valuables secure and wear your bag at the front. I had my back pockets touched a number of times during the show but fortunately had my RFID wallet in my front pocket on a chain secured to my belt. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and recommend the park as a good day out for the family. If you stay at one of the Disney resorts they are only a short shuttle bus ride or 15minute walk from the park. We stayed at the Disney Explorers Lodge which already has hundreds of reviews on trip advisor so I will not repeat them here.",4
"Visited the park during the month of October and they have Halloween themed parade in the evening. The rides are clean and safe. Some rides have Fastpass facility where you can use the entry ticket to get a fast pass ticket which indicate the alloted time for you to come back to take the ride. When you return during the alloted time, you get to bypass the normal queue line and go right to the beginning of the Q. Note** you can only get one fastpass at a time. So do plan how you want to use this facility. Bring your own water bottle to refill water. The price of bottled drinks are 3 times more than what I pay outside the park.There is a locker service (HK$100) for whole day so you dont have to carry big bags while riding. Park policy: No wheeled travel bag, you have to carry them",4
We visited the park with my daughter and family. Our 10 year old and 12 year old grandsons definitely enjoyed it. It is a bit smaller than the Magic Kingdom in Florida and some of the rides are the same. But there are differences even on some rides like the runaway mine train and hyperspace mountain. The food quality was disappointing for a Disney park and was the reason for not getting a rating of 5. ,4
"I have visited 4 Disney parks so far and Hong Kong Disneyland is very small. The signature castle is very small!! Super small!! Some rides are different and some rides are missing like pirates of my the Caribbean, haunted mansion. The small world ride is longer, it last longer!! But they have less little puppets. They dodon't have the delicious and famous turkey legs!! In October several restaurants were closed. Something that was really shocking for Disney was people who work there did not speak English or spoke English very limited. Really a shame, In Paris, and the USA most of them are bilingual. Here you have one tip, if you are going to buy your tickets on line buy them with the 3 meal plan, you would pay 30 US dollars per person more but just one main dish for lunch is 20 US dollars, ( and you would get a snack, lunch( main dish plus soda) dinner (main dish with soda) and a discount for a beverage) so it definitely is worth it. And you can finish the park in one day.",4
"Great first Disneyland experience! I felt like a little kid again, I just wish we saw more characters to take a photo with, not that many were available and we got there right when the park opened. Other then that rides were fun, food was good, and I got engaged there! Thanks Hong Kong Disney! ",4
I'd recommend visiting this place during the weekdays to avoid large crowds. Make sure you reach the gates no later than 10:00 AM to have a complete day experience.,4
"We went the last week of September, knowing that the beginning of October is a Chinese holiday and it would be crowded then. Not knowing what to expect, it was great!! They weredon't even using the fast pass system as there were almost no lines. We got to go on aa the rides we wanted to with hardly waiting at al!! This time of the year is highly recommended. The kids loved it.",4
"As expected with any Disneyland, it was magical! The park was clean and had all the usual things you expect from Disney. With our trip being October the parade was Halloween themed with all the villains from Disney, a very nice touch! It was shame there wasdon't a larger variety of food. It was mainly corn on the cob and chicken sausage on a stick. The overall day was brilliant but if the staff looked they like enjoyed working there it would definitely have been 5* ",4
Hong Disneyland is a must if you are traveling to the area with children or if you're just a Disney fanatic. Toy Story Land was different than Orlando's Disney World and a nice touch. I think it would be better if Hong Kong Disney Land had a few more western options for food and where are the infamous Mickey pretzels? Missed those! ,4
"To go here better you go by MTR. The last train is really cute. They have all disney character inside. And the window like mickey's. But remember, they are not allowed you to eat or drink inside the train and the station area. You can eat and drink outside the station area. ",4
i go here with my family every year we are enjoying the parks attraction more particularly the disney on parade and the 5d theater,4
Having no other experience on Disney we had little to compare our visit with. We are retired a day we had a lovely day despite occasional showers. The park wasdon't too busy when we arrived wait times increased as the day progressed. I feel this park is probably perfect for younger children there was one or two thrilling rides the establishment are comparable with somewhere like Thorpe park or Lego land. B,4
Being middle aged without any kids I probably am the wrong person to rate this since it is a fantasy land for kids. But there are still quite a few things for us adults as well. I liked the Star Wars themed Hyperspace Mountain is a really fast and cramped rollercoaster. Since it all is so fast I didn   t really get the Star Wars feeling I wanted. I really liked the Iron Man Experience. And the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars was a great rollercoaster. But what I really loved was the Mystic Manor. A great little thing that really draws you into the story. We went on the Monday after the Golden Week and didn   t need to use any of our Fast Passes. Great! We didn   t have a problem doing everything we wanted in a day.,4
"I visited here on 22.9.17 and loved it. It is very easy to get to by train and then just a short walk from the Disney station to the entrance. For seniors it is one of the best values in town HK$100 (which includes all rides and attraction) so make sure you have something to prove your age. The whole place is Disney    immaculate    and there are many rides and attractions and many many shop! At this stage of life, I forego the more adventurous rides and was more than satisfied with the    It   s a small world    wonderful    river cave    type boat ride gliding past animated representations of children from all over the world (did that twice), the Cinderella Carousel and the quite amazing Mystic Manor attraction. The 30 minute stage show presentation of The Festival of The Lion King is just wonderful. Such spectacle and energy. Then there are the day and evening parades with hundreds of performers including the ubiquitous rodents Mickey and Minnie and the duck!",4
"This is smaller than then American equivalent but it it worth the visit. It has much of the same magic and they do quite well at making the Disney experience memorable. Remember that there are some rides that aredon't open all day. The parade was good. Night time was better. Everything is on a smaller scale. If this is your first park, you will love it, if you have done Anaheim, you will notice the difference. Unlike Shanghai they have Tinkerbell. ",4
"Our favorites were Star wars, mine cart and iron man sections. Food was very expensive (hamburger menu 100 hkd, water 30 hkd). Entrance fee is 540 hkd for adults, 480 hkd for kids below 11 yrs old",4
I only met Mickey Mouse once. I dodon't even met any princess. But I met Capt America and Spiderman. It's so hot I cadon't bare it. Grizzly's mine is one of the best ride. Mystic Manor is also good. Stark tower is awesome. But the best is the Hyperspace Mountain. The are still many empty lot to put new rides.,4
I arrived at the 10 and by the time I left at 5 I had seen the entire park. I had fun on my first Disney experience and liked that the park was very walkable. The food is super expensive and not very good (at least what I had) so make sure to bring lunch snacks. ,4
"Must see for kids, judging by their reaction to everything what is happening.I will now talk about obvious things, but those were disappointing.Half of performances are in Chinese, which Is logical, but does not allow one english speaking to fully integrateVery limited choice of food, mostly fast food, which is always true for open parks as well. Not too much interactive attractions, rather very conservativeStill, for kids this is lots of fun, so I suppose adult's opinion is a bit biased ",4
"All the wonderful amenities expected of Disneyland.  A much smaller park, but has some really fun rides.  Definitely go on Big Grizzly Mountain and Hyperspace Mountain.",4
"So this is the 4th Disney Park my fianc  e and I have travelled to together. Although this park is a lot smaller than the others we both really enjoy the intimacy of the park. The rides were very fun. They had all the great rides that all the Disney parks have, other than pirates of the Caribbean and splash mountain. It was a bit disappointing not having a water ride in HK, considering how hot it is. Two things that disappointed us was that we really struggled to find vegetarian meals that were dairy free (allergies) and the merchandise wasn   t great. We didn   t buy any merchandise. Usually we do, but this park just disappointed us when it came to merchandise. Overall though for a theme park with rides it was great. ",4
"Disneyland never fails to disappoint. HK Disney is really easy to get to by train and once you get off you feel like the magic begins. Go in the middle of the week if possible because it isdon't as busy, the longest we waited for a ride was 30 minutes, and even though you wait it's still an experience. The best rides for adults and kids over 7 were Hyperspace Mountain and Big Grizzly runaway minecars. When it comes to food I highly recommend taking snacks and water. With the water though you can fill them up at the water stations. We had dinner st the Corner Cafe which was ok given the standard of food at all Disney locations. 10 hours later, sore feet and tired kids but it's all worth it   it is the happiest place on earth! ",4
"This was our first family experience of Disneyland, and whilst good was probably not comparable with the US parks. I'm saying this as it was easily covered in a day. For the younger kids it's great, but post 6 or 7 the rides are limited. That said, we still had a great day and the ambience is magical. My son is 8 going on 9 and loved the day. The rides are clean and the place is well staffed. The park was packed when we attended as it was the day after a public holiday, and the heat was oppressive. But we still had a great but very tiring day. Having been to Ocean Park, for older kids and whilst it's not as polished as Disney, it has bigger rides that will better suit them. ",4
Perhaps because we went really early in the day but this trip to HK Disney land was really quite enjoyable. Less crowded ...I imagine a lot of mainland Chinese may have opted to go to the one opened in Shanghai. Disney keeps consistent standards and for this I am appreciative. Great family time! No complaints! The Christmas decorations made it even more special!,4
"No of high adventure and roller coaster rides could have been more. Just 2 are available. But very nice shows and rides for kids. Jungle boat ride, grizzle roller coaster ride,lion king show for kids etc were good. Try fast pass during peak hrs to skip queue. Visited end of September on a weekday. Very less crowd and diddon't have to wait more than 5mins for any rides or shows. Took popular rides even 2 3 times. Not the case during usual days where queues take 30 45mins for popular rides. May be this time of year is best to visit. ",4
"Good place for family with young children or those who are young at heart. Prepare to spend half a day to enjoy the attractions.My family and I enjoyed ourselves a lot, especially my 11 yrs old son.A not to miss place whenever you are in Hong Kong.Thank you.",4
"So fun! Love having this on our doorstep. Really clean, short queues (mid week anyway, have not braved a weekend). Food like all Disneys is terrible.",4
"Hong Kong Disneyland is one of the Best 2 and the most expensive Theme Parks in Hong Kong.This Theme Park is maily for the Disney's Characters, like mickey mouse, minie moiuse, donald duck, snow white etc.The entrance fee is expensive (HK$639 for adult) and It takes quite a long time to there from the city districts.",4
"This is the 4th time we visited Hong Kong Disneyland! We love the friendly staff there especially they will help you take photos with the characters there using my phone . The iron man 4D ride is great though we have to queue for 1 hours! But we did expect that as its school summer holiday thereThe food, however is not good after they close down the Mai sum restaurant for yum Cha ... now we have to eat at food court which offer limited choices .. the staff are unfriendly as well in the restaurant ",4
"Of the Disneyland Parks throughout the world, this appears to be the smallest!! The rides are all great for all ages. Small world and Miner   s ride were great fun!! Teacups and Dumbo ride was great. Restaurant needs to have    Malt Vinegar    for the fish and chips!!!!!!!",4
"Disneyland opens at 10:30 but as we have anticipated , gates will be crowded as early as 8 am, so we went early. we were at the gate by 8:30 . This gives us an opportunity t take pictures outside the gate. when we got inside, we first queuep up for photo op with Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Queues take 1 hour.If you have kids with you, be sure to get a trolley. Tip: Foods are not allowed inside. You need to wear comfy shoes and put on sunblock.",4
"This was my fifth visit to the attraction and improvements have been made. I was disappointed that Buzz Lightyear was closed however enjoyed the day anyway. The sight is not that big so can be seen in around 3   4 hours. The Ironman ride was good, the Disney Parade was excellent especially as it was 30 degrees plus heat and the dancers were performing in heavy costumes. Overall a good day out.",4
This was a nice change in pace during our holiday in Hong Kong. We went through the week and it was lovely and quiet   we diddon't queue for any of the attractions . It is so much smaller than any other Disney park but the children who we saw there were having a great time and their faces were a picture when they spotted characters walking around. Food outlets plentiful as were drinks stations and not extortionate prices. A good day for families we would say. ,4
Hot but nice to visit.. crowded is unavoidable.. everything very fresh.. will visit again in other country..,4
"Went there to celebrate my son's birthday. Weather was hot. When we went inside the toilet i almost fell asleep, air conditioning was heavenly. I suggest avoid month of June, mix of hot and sudden rainy weather.",4
Best to go in afternoon and into the evening because of the heat parade and fireworks start around 7pmSome of the rides are a bit scary for kids without much commentary before you line up and get on My grandson is 7 and came off the Star Wars ride crying because he found it too scary There is lots to see and do allow at least 5 hours,4
"Have to queue for most of the attractions. Wear comfortable shoes and prepare to queue all day. Food is really expensive and outside food and drinks are not allowed. They do check your bags before you go in. The queue to go in is long but they managed that quite efficiently. Souvenirs are pricey too. Overall, I had fun but had to queue a lot ",4
"As a whole it would be hard to say that Disneyland Hong Kong is the best Disney park of them all. I'm not saying that this park isdon't fun, it's just a little bit fractured compared to other Disney parks. The lands while they exist aredon't as harmonious as you might find at other parks. The difference at this park is the quality of some of their attractions. Mystic Manor is probably one of the best Disney rides ever built. Grizzly Gulch Mine Train is one of the best roller coasters on any Disney property. Best of all each one of these attractions is surrounded by a well themed land.The new Iron Man attractions are OK, but nothing worth the trip alone. The food at this park is hit or miss, depending on where you eat. This could be a one day visit, or a two day visit if you're really into Disney parks.",4
Was a good time with friends but I would say the kids will have absolute fun here. The most beautiful experience was the parades and fire works. It was awesome never to miss this two especially.,4
HK Disney was great for us since we had a 2 and 3 year old and it was our first time at any Disney. The small size made it so that it was not overwhelming. The lines were not long at all while we were there. I do wish we had gotten to see more characters and that the shuttle stop was closer and more convenient. It's possibly quicker to walk.,4
"Accesible via train, car and buses! Disneyland is HUGE!! Download their app for better attraction timings such as meeting disney characters and show times. 1 day pass is not enough to cover the entire park! Too many lands to explore! Standy sunscreen, cap, sunglasses, umbrella! Loads of walk too. Recommend you guys to stay till closing when they do their fireworks display at 8pm HK Time. Same day re entry into park allowed. Just keep your tickets and get your hand stamped! The only bad thing is the overpriced water stations! They should have water coolers around too! Standby loads of cash for water and merchandise!! If you missed out on some merchandise, Hong Kong Airport Terminal 1 has a mini Disney Store! ",4
New lands with new rides has made this a real Disneyland as 7 years ago it was just a small theme park with some nice shows. Teens loved grizzly gulch and toy story land. The lion king show is a great attraction. Definitely worth the effort to get here from HK island,4
"HK Disneyland is very accessible from downtown via MTR. Try to buy the entry tickets online via authorised travel company and you can enjoy some discounts. You can also skip the long ticketing queue. Disney experience will require a full day. As i have made my visit twice to HK Disney on different occasions, my advice is try to come during the cool winter season. Under 34deg weather, you will easily go  punctured  by afternoon. Do arrive at the time of opening if you want to maximise your coverage of rides and shows. Some form of strategy is required. Bring your water bottle and keep yourself hydrated. Water points are available at every washroom area. Food and beverages are rather pricey.",4
We had a spare day recently in HK and decided to go to Disneyland for the day (half a day). No kids as they are all grown up...however we did take them here when it first opened. We had so much fun and laughed like kids ourselves. Very hot in August so take an umbrella for sun protection. There is not a lot of protection when walking around. Not quite like the American Disneyland's but still a lot of fun,4
I bought my 4 grand children here and my daughters and soninlaw had the most fun a small Disneyland but had everything packed into it with the fireworks and street parade a wow factor.,4
We weredon't sure whether to go but we're glad we did. It was quite quiet since HK kids had gone back to school so there was mainly little children who weredon't wanting to do the rides we wanted to!!!! Lovely to see Mickey & Minnie open the park. Did nearly every ride we wanted to. Only thing to watch for is due to it being quiet a lot of the eateries were closed. So had to eat where was open. Evening parade was cancelled due to rain. Having said that we had a great day full of fun & laughter.,4
"Highly recommended attraction in Hong Kong. It's the smallest of the Disney castle parks but it's worth a visit. Loved the exclusive attractions big grizzly mountain, mystic manor and the walk trough attraction (Marvel themed in summer 2017). Also if you have never been to California ride this version of space mountain. Without kids the park cans be seen and finished in 4 5 hours, just arrive early and most of the attractions will be walk on (visited end of August). Food portions were good but their snacks are not near as good interesting as Tokyo Disney resort. ",4
"This was the only reason we went to Hong Kong this time And it was well worth the trip. Growing up watching all the Disney movies and characters, one definitely experiences a different high when in Disneyland. From the different rides and attractions to the parades to the final feature of the night which embarrassingly brought tears of happiness to my eyes, one definitely needs to visit this happiest place in Hong Kong",4
"We spent 5 days in HK and the main reason for our trip for for us, finally to show our children Disney.As a former WDW cast member I have a soft spot for our famous mouse and in light of the fact that I met my wife while working for Disney Cruise Line it is often a very emotional visits to any Disney properties.Getting there is a breeze   use the subway we took 3 lines to get there and it took 30 mins   get to Sunny Bay and then you are transported onto Disney's very own rail system and they transport you to a lovely Disney styled train stop.First and foremost Disney do what they do very well, they have a level of guest engagement that all other parks strive for and that is exactly the case here in HKFrom the very moment you enter the park you come into contact with Cast Members who love what they do and that reflects in the level of service that you receive.The park is divided into 5 zones and if anyone has visited a park in FL for example they will be instantly familiar with the geography.Main St gives you a view of the Castle and an amazing backdrop of the mountains in the background.Adventure land, just like in FL give you the old west and the run away mine carts.A point of note, if you have kids and they would like to take part in Jedi Academy   make a point of going to tomorrow land first as this tends to book up fast.The majority of the FNB is centered around the local demographic and that being said I found it great to try something other that burgers and fries, which does tend to wear thin theses days.Parades   Disney do them so well the first starts @ 1530 and the night parade starts @ 1930   loved them.We chose to take a 2 pass and loved every minute of it.Great day out..",4
"We went there a day before Christmas (so this is a late review) anticipating that the park would be full but we diddon't expect that much people. Long lines for all the nice rides awaited us. Even to get a picture with the characters entailed a 30 min wait minimum. To get a lunch table, you had to dash to one when a table frees up so that you will not lose the table to another hungry group. Even then, we had fun. The weather was nice, no rains and not too cold. As we had a toddler with us, we spent a lot of time on the not so popular rides (or as my cousin would call them, wimpy rides, lol) and my daughter had so much fun. :) You can see the wonder in her eyes when she saw characters big and up close. We got fast passes for some of the rides and just waited them out sitting on some benches at the park. This is probably my third visit to this park and the first one with my daughter and husband with me. We enjoyed the shows especially the Golden Mickey show (the one with the 4D) and the Lion King. :) A not to miss attraction when you visit Hongkong, but maybe go at a non peak season so you can maximize the cost of your ticket.",4
"Disneyland Hong Kong is for everyone, children and adult! We spent about 4 hours in the park. Hot weather, crowded everywhere but we still enjoy ourselves even though we diddon't stay until the firework at 8pm. Nevertheless, we had a nice time in Disneyland in our Hong Kong holiday. ",4
"This is a great park for under 10s. This was our second visit, and we had two days here. First day was realised it just got busier and busier, even around 5pm people were flooding in when we expected it would start to thin out. Day two, we had a plan. Arrive before 10:30 opening time and hit Fantasyland first. Also, for the 3:30pm parade we were towards the entrance end of Main Street and they stop for a big dance and music routine. I think I enjoyed it more than the kids!!!",4
This was our second visit in Disneyland HK. The Park has improved a lot since then. All the Avengers attraction are quite interesting at least for our sons age 10 and 6. The best time for visiting is morning 10 13. Lately it is overcrowded and average waiting time for each attraction is 30 60 min.,4
"well, it's Disneyland so the prices of things food in there is expected.the rides are not too bad. some rides are very detailed and nice. unfortunately the weather was not too good when we went, so some rides were closed.food on the other hand, was horrible. diddon't taste good and was expensive.the merchandise was average but price was on the high side. eventually we still purchased some items as it is from  Disneyland .Diddon't manage to take any photos with the characters as they controlled the number. wanted to join the queue but they said it was closed. was kinda disappointed.coulddon't complain much as it was my 1st trip to Disneyland.I would say it was a nice trip there overall, but I guess that was cause we went there on a weekday where it wasdon't that crowded. I heard the crowd in weekends was crazy.",4
"My first time to a Disneyland so I cannot compare it to the other ones. They have several themed areas for every childs needs. Tomorrowland is where we spent most of the time. They have several interesting attractions. A day is in my opinion enough. The souvenir shops with overpriced items but hey, it is Disneyland. No surprise. But this is a must for families visiting HK. Enjoy it.",4
"A must visit for Disney fans. For those who expect a lot of rides and a big park sorry. But HK Disneyland is just the right size to spend a day. When we went, it wasdon't crazy crowded and did get on most rides , longest wait was 40min. Definitely a must do sctivity",4
"Good range of rides for all ages, only 2 real adult rides but still fun. Park is relatively small so easy enough to maximise in one day and highly recommend going when it's forecast to be cloudy or rain, it's usually sporadic and generally no queues. Recommend getting a meal voucher from Klook which is easy to use and reasonable value. You can bring your own bottle of water and refill at the park. Make the most of fastpass at the hyperspace mountain.",4
We were 2 adults. Better to buy online the ticket to jump the queue at the box office. I think that one complete day is enough to visit the park and try almost all the attraction.,4
Very good theme park. Ideal for the whole family. Very convenient transportation wise and very systematic. Though food inside the park is not really good and expensive. Kids will definitely enjoy the rides and the shows.,4
Kids loved it. Just the place to unwing and have some god family time. Would love to be back but in better weather,4
"We were lucky! The day we went to disneyland, the typhoon Beaufort force 8 signal was just reduced to a 3. So not many people were in Disneyland. All ride ques were less than 5 minutes wait! We got to enjoy all the rides indoors and some outdoors (when the typhoon force reduced to 1). The park still opens despite rain. Magical experience. Felt happy. The environment was friendly. Many staff around to guide you. Good attractions. Plenty food options around. Delicious food. If it is raining, just go around in a raincoat!",4
"The visit to Disneyland was the visit that was ruined by bad weather. Even though it was raining, we still went for the sake of our granddaughter. Most rides and shows were open. We enjoyed the Lion King show and lined up for photo ops with Mickey and Minnie and Donald and Daisy, ride the carousel, went inside Small World , ate at Plaza Inn and shopped for souvenirs. Too bad, the parade was cancelled due to bad weather. It would have been the highlight of our granddaughter's visit.",4
"We managed to get great weather and enjoyed 6 great hours of Disney fun. The park has the traditional Disney atmosphere with lots of activities and stores to keep you busy. Activities for all ages from kids to teenagers   then again which adult doesdon't turn into a kid when they see Mickey Mouse. You'll need stamina to walk and if it's a busy day, you'll need patience to wait in the lines. There are no traditional fast passes, look around as each popular ride has a unique fast pass method through vending machines. The food options are basic and can get very very busy at meal times. We waited for 30 mins at one location for a table and then ended up moving to another area of the park just to get a bite. ",4
"We are group of 6 girls. In short: the weather was too hot, a lot of people, long Q for each game (around 1 hour), food also expensive if you dodon't book in advance.I like the fireworks show and crazy rides. Tip: Bring your umbrella or big hat. Bring a book or whatever to entertain yourself while queuing. Bring small bag if you plan to play the crazy rides. ",4
"Though nowhere near the same size as Disneyland in Anaheim this Disneyland is well worth a visit. Very clean, organised, well signposted, most of the rides were the same my only criticism would be there are not enough places to sit down particularly considering the oppressive heat and humidity.",4
"You already know what to expect from this theme park. I highly recommend to try the newest attraction   Iron Man. It is 4D experience. If you have kids with you, a 2 day itinerary is highly recommended especially during summer as it's really hot. You also need 2 hours to line up for a mickey and minnie picture. It's best to visit this during the cold season.",4
"Return visit. Smaller than Paris one but ok for a day. Went on a weekend but longest we queued was 30 mins and we also made use of free fast pass for 2 rides. The parades were great and viewing easy if there 15 20 mins early. Free water fountains by toilet areas but we bought bottled, about 12 70ml over the day (4 of us sharing) as sooooo humid and hot. Not great for adrenaline junkies as only 2 3 big rides but out 11&13 yr olds still enjoyed. Queued to meet one princess but Donne there early as only out in the heat for about 15 mins at a time. Not supposed to take food in but we took fruit and was searched and ok'd. With a fast good lunch of fish and chips   40 ish plus Micky waffles   5 each (big) and water throughout day we spent approx   90 but that's so much cheaper than the Paris one. Disney does it well and we had s great but very hot day. Diddon't stay for fireworks as too tired. Travelled from city on metro and used a day ticket for approx   6 per adult. 45mins hotel to park! ",4
"Definitely smaller than the one in Paris, the Hong Kong Disneyland also offers what the other Disneyland parks offers to its guests. Rides, shows, meet and greet session with Disney characters, a parade of Disney stars, and an impressive fire works display to cap off the day just to name a few. Just like the Hong Kong Ocean Park, I personally wish that the shows were done in English rather than Cantonese. Visitors of this place should prepare for long queues so if its a sunny day make sure that you also bring an umbrella with you aside from wearing comfortable shoes. It can also get quite hot in Hong Kong so also bring along extra water with you.",4
"Compared to other Disneylands, perhaps not great value for money. The queues are nuts. There's a heavy emphasis on merchandising, more than other Disney's. Brace yourself for the interesting convergence of cultures re lining up lol.   It's okay. Wodon't be back.",4
It is always wonderful visiting Disney properties! This is a smaller Disneyland but we loved it! The rides were fun! We loved HyperMountain ride! We were at the park on a week day and the lines were short compared to DisneyWorld in the summer! The park is a great adventure for younger kids for sure!,4
"We have visited many theme parks all over the world and Hong Kong Disneyland was one of the top 5 in our list. Getting to Disneyland was easy and the rides were also pretty great. You can get a fast pass for some of the rides where there is a long wait or you could go for other rides in the meantime. The only downside for this was that, it was not available for all the rides and you had to wait for it no matter what, which was frustrating and tiring. The universal studios in Singapore had a better system where you could get an express pass by paying extra and skip the ques and save on a good 2 3 hours. The weather is also known to change pretty quick so remember to get an umbrella. The cost for the tickets was around 600 HKD pp and it was cheaper to buy the tickets at the airport. Remember to get your own bottled water as water was very expensive in the Disneyland. Overall it is a great activity to do with your friends and family, so remember to get a good camera for amazing memories!",4
"Great day out it's a small Disneyland but they have still paid lots of attention to detail!Very accessible from the Disney metro, super clean resort. Try to get there as soon as doors open (before 10.30) as locals dodon't appear to get out before 11 12 so there were practically no queues and it just got busier and busier the later it got.There is only really 3 rides and these are not big so it is definitely not a park for thrill seekers.The parade and musicals were amazing but they get full fast so make sure you queue up early!Drinks are about 3hk dollars and main food meals from 10hk dollars and up so relatively good prices for a park like this!Overall would recommend!",4
"It's Disneyland, what can you possibly say except that kids would definitely love coming here for the rides and the other attractions. It was a lot of fun and their parade is a great thing to wait for and experience. It was incredibly HOT though when we visited and I was thinking it'd probably be best to avoid these summer days next time. But aside from that   which is by no means or possibility Disney's fault   it was definitely a lot of fun for the kids and us kids at heart alike.",4
"Went to Shanghai Disneyland what a big difference when we went to Hong Kong Disneyland. It's like night and day!! Less crowded the people are not rude, no cutting lines everyone waits their turn. Really enjoyed seeing the Tarzan play it highlighted the Chinese acrobatic talent. That was probably my favorite show at Disneyland. Because it is not crowded we were able to see and cover more of the park in less hours. We only had time for about half day   4 hours and it was plenty enough time to cover what we wanted to see and do. All in all this is a pleasant experience and worth going to visit despite everyone saying it's so small and not worth it. Believe it I enjoyed myself here more than Shanghai Disneyland. Thumbs up for Hong Kong Disneyland and the people have more class here and wait patienty their turn.",4
"The children had a lot of fun at this HK park, waiting time for the attractions was not too long (surely we did not go in the peak season).  Average food quality, fast food type, as in all Disneyland locations tough.",4
Our 3rd time to HK Disneyland as an older couple. Love seeing the young people enjoying themselves. Very humid and several showers of rain. Our food at the Explorers Club Restaurant was very average and overpriced. All merchandise is too dear. Staff well trained and very polite. $28 for a bottle of water.,4
"Pay close attention to the guide to get the best out of this place. Plan carefully...Try not to miss the parades, stage shows, and many attractions. It's a long day if you stay for the 9pm fireworks display and you should, it wodon't disappoint...Plenty of food outlets and I mean plenty, merchandise stores also. All in all a slick well run operation...Disney does it right after decades of experience you'd expect nothing less from the moment you step on the Disney train with the Mickey Mouse ears...One worthy note, the fast track tickets are only valid at specific times for rides and attractions. You may arrive at an attraction only to find a sign saying come back in an hour...as with most places in HK if you visit at the W E or public holiday, there's gonna be long queues. Try to visit midweek...",4
"Of course, its Disneyland so my kids loved it! the food inside was okay too but quite expensive.of course the souvenirs are expensive too hahaha! we have been to Disneyland in Anaheim, California and if I compare the two Disneylands, Anaheim would still be better. But, HK Disney is still Disneyland : ) My only comment would have to be that some of the shows were in Chinese, because it is in HK! but they could have considered that there are many foreigners too who would have loved Mickey Mouse to speak in English not in Mandarin (?). But all in all, still loved Disneyland!!!!",4
"the first time my wife and I have been to a Disney park without our son or grandkids, I even got a senior discount! Full marks for the ease of getting there using MTR and the special connection.We went on a Friday and it was quite comfortable. I imagine at a weekend during school holidays it will get very crowded, but we were able to get on all the things we wanted to without big queues.One or Two day passes are on sale. I cannot see how it could take more than one day to do everything, even with children in tow. In all a very pleasant day out.",4
Definitely get a fast pass. We went in holiday period of China was crazy busy and certainly no manners with some tourists alot of cutting and pushing..can do it all in one day...staff friendly and helpful...very hot in the park...if like us your children are tall take a copy of their passport we were spoken to so rudely because our children aged 11 and 9 are extremely tall they accused us of lying about their ages (was a bit of a dampener at the beginning)..The parades are great and the fireworks amazing...,4
Enjoyed our Asian Disney trip. The lines were not that long. The Lion King production was SUPERB. The food was ok. Overall it was a spectacular show.,4
"It's the first time me and my wife had went to Hong Kong Disneyland and I must say the whole experience from start to end was a really magical one. Although the rides do not have the same thrill and excitement level as compared to Ocean Park, HK Disneyland well makes up for it in other ways bringing out your inner child with the familiarity of the Disney franchises. We really love some of the rides like the big grizzly mountain runaway mine, RC car, Disney express, mystic manor and it's a small world. Not to mention the parade and firework finale which was both the highlight of our visit at the theme park.Compliments also to the staff for the efficient crowd control during the fireworks. We thought that they did a pretty good job keeping the situation in order despite the huge crowd. ",4
"Great little Disney park which isdon't too bad for the price of admission. However, in typical Disney fashion the food and drinks are hugely expensive and not very nice. The range is average and if you're a vegetarian good luck finding something appetising.The fast pass system works well and we loved the Star Wars coaster. ",4
"I went on the Chinese holiday and it was hot and extremely busy. Put my bags in their holding area (at a charge) then walked further down to the entry area and lined up for an hour to get in. Every ride had a sign saying 70 or 80 minute wait. Saw a hot dog at a vendor, the only thing in the whole park I liked to eat and after lining up for 40 mins, when I asked fir one they say  sold out, sorry I walked around in the hot hot sun in and out of all the people and then left. Was not a great particular day for me to go. ",4
Amazing park perfect for young children maybe not so much young adults but as not many adult rides. My kids absolutely loved it from the rides to meeting their favorite characters. To be expected everything is expensive costing near $5 aud for water. But its a smaller very well maintained park with alot smaller wait times then the Anaheim park. Loved it. The only reason its 4 not 5 is prices.,4
"Probably not the best idea to visit Disney when it's 36 degrees Celsius. But we enjoyed our day at the park. Not as much big roller coasters as in the other disneyparks. Lines were not too long, longest about 30 minutes. The new Marvel attractions are great. Because of the humid and hot weather we decided to leave early so we diddon't catch the light show.",4
"Had a great day @ Disneyland, although their outlets food and beverage prices are outrageously high, except for that, a great day for the kids.",4
Nice park and has some good rides . A good place to enjoy for adults and kids and spend a nice fun day.,4
"We went just after they open the Iron man ride. Kids loved it! we even went twice. A good tip is to go during the week day, and avoid the national holiday, and school holiday, as it get very crowded. By going during the week, we barely wait more than 5 min per ride. Dodon't miss the new StarWars mountain, steeper, and faster than the Space mountains.",4
My family and I went to Hong Kong Disneyland end Decemeber 2016. The crowd very pack. We spend whole day there. Fireworks was spectacular and amazing. Suitable for children and adults.,4
Too many queues to wait honestly. But it's a must for those family with young kids as they will love it. Im not really into those kind of the theme park so it's kinda boring for me. I prefer yhe universal instead. They also have a parade and fireworks at night. ,4
"My 38 months son really enjoyed. Compared to other Disneys, it was a small one. But i think it is perfect for family with little kids as you can cover the whole park in a day. Well managed and clean. Little bit pricey for foods and drinks. However, the entrance fee was worth the money as my son really liked. Overall it was another great family time. ",4
                                       Fantastic experience!!! Must for families with children or group of friends.   Try to visit Hong Kong during winter.     ,4
"I have an awesome experience in Hong Kong Disneyland although I cannot play all the attraction. I reached HKDL around 11am and there are quite a number of people queuing at the security check and waited 10 mins. Maybe we visit weekday, we just waited 10 mins to enter the park. It was fast. Please make sure you go to Toy Story Land to play the attraction first. Because the waiting time for Toy Story Land is more than 60 mins. Then only go get the fast pass ticket for the Iron Man Attraction Hyper Space Mountain Winnie The Pooh attraction. Lastly, make sure you wait till the end to watch the fireworks, it was super nice.",4
A lovely small Park with plenty of adventures waiting for young Children. My 4 year old and 3 year old sons havedon't stopped talking about it since. Plenty to see and do with a good variety of World wide cuisines,4
"It was a an awesome experience, despite not riding everything due to a long queue which is normal in a leisure park. I so love the evening parade and the fire works. Except for food and water which are expensive.",4
"We went there on summer, and the heat just almost unbearable.The rides, however, really fun. And once the sun is down, the park feels much better.The rides: good, the ambience: nice. The food: great. The public facilities: well maintained. However, there are nothing more. Basically, just as expected from a Disneyland.",4
"We visited this place 10 years ago with our girls , most of it are the same except one or two new land ( like the Toy story ) .It was very hot becos it is summer , and everyone will look for a air conditioner cafe but there are not many plus it is Jam pack with loads of tourists. if you have young children , it is better to bring an umbrella with a portable fan for each child . Q up for rides and show is not really that long but for some famous ride , it will take up about half hour to an hour Q up time , sometime the area is not air condition so do remember to have water and some snacks for kids to keep them entertained .If you are travelling with young children , do remember when the last show ends , there will be a lot of them leaving together, so it will take up at lest half hour trying to go to their Disney train b4 changing to MTR , so your travel time to go home will now be at lest half more than your original time .",4
"Very easy to go there by train, even though you need to change it few times. Clean and friendly staff as in all Disneyland parks. Our kids are 12,10 and 5 and they really liked the attractions. Restaurants offer mainly Asian food but pizzas and burgers can be found too. If you visit the park during the rainy season, bring your rain poncho or buy it from the park (kids size 60 HKD). Fireworks in the end are worth of seeing. ",4
"We were super exited about going to Disney but we were a bit disappointed with the size of the park. This is the smallest Disney theme park but it's has expensive as the other theme park. They should sell their tickets for a bit less, it's quite expensive for a family. In all we had a great day, the parade and fireworks were magical. ",4
"Children and adults will enjoy this place, its called the happiest place on earth for nothing. But it rained really hard when we went there, and wearing the ponchos sold at the park makes you a person with wet pants and sweaty shirt.. its so humid hot wearing that rain ponchos lol. So either sweat or get wet from the rain. We only get to tried two rides and lined up for almost an hour under the rain for a picture with mickey and minnie mouse. The parade and fireworks was cancelled due to bad weather. Wish we had better weather as we could have enjoy the park more.",4
"As expected, high quality rides, shows, standards and expensive food and souvenirs! You dodon't do Disney every day so suck it up and enjoy. Had a great day!",4
It is very good for entertainment but small and do not go on weekends is very crowded. The food inside is very expensive and the staff it is not like us but is a good park and you will have fun,4
"We had a lovely time at Disneyland Hong Kong! Not as big as Los Angeles Disneyland, but still get that wonderful Disney vibe! Happily spent 2 days here.",4
We went with our Kids ages from 10 to 21 the park is small and the rides are also for smaller kids. The show during the day was lots of fun and the evening show was amazing. For the rest not the most exciting park I have visited. ,4
"It is one of the famous amusement parks in Asia. Though not being as big as others in Asia owing to limited land in Hong Kong, it still has its peculiar feature, a fusion of Oriental and Western style.  It is worth seeing",4
I went on a fairly rainy day but it was still fun. Toy Story land is really good. The Small World palace is incredible. It's fairly small compared to the American Disney places but it was still cool.,4
This is a small Disneyland but there is more than enough to do for a full day there. Lots of good rides and shows. I dodon't understand why they open the gates at 10am but then make everyone stand in the sun until 10.30 before you can go to the rides.,4
"It's easy to go by MTR. We arrived at 10.30 am (opening hour) on Monday, but there's a lot of people in lines in front of the entrance. We already had tickets so it helped a lot. The weather was very hot, but our 2 kids, my grandsons, 6 and 2 years old, had a lot of fun. We stayed there until 7.30 pm.",4
"Our daughter had never been to a Disneyland so it was a special treat to go there while in Hong Kong. It was a long MTR ride from Wanchai  Kowloon area and we had to stand all the way until we connected with the Disney train at Sunny Bay. That train was cute with Mickey shaped windows and handles to hold.Yes we got to have a photo with Mickey and Minnie which was our main goal! The queue was lng and it poured with rain while we were in the queue but we persisted.The street parade was fun, but our highlight was the Lion King show. It was amazing! Top quality performance.As we live on the Gold Coast, Australia where we have four big theme parks, I would have to say that their rides are better, but overalll it was a fun day and gave a touch of Disney that had been missing in our daughter's life.You can take food and drink into the park, they do bag checks but just to check for weapons dangerous items.",4
Tip: Ask for a Senior ticket if you qualify as it is a quarter of the price of a child's ticket.  I wanted a photograph with a Storm Trooper but he turned his back on me and ssid that he was on patrol!  Very in Disney,4
"A Disney experience with a China twist, like every Disney Park, it is crowded, just more so here but the nice thing is the people are much more friendly and very interesting to talk to while on line.",4
Remember to get fastpass (is free of charge) at certain attractions to cut short your waiting time. AND stay for the amazing fireworks at 9pm! Please be there early to get a good view.,4
Enjoyed my day from morning till 9 pm. Maximized the visit since it's quite expensive entrance ticket.  Get online promo for ticket and meals if possible (meals are very expensive),4
I love Disney land because there is everything you need to have fun! There is yummy food amazing rides. I would recommend this place to tourists.,4
Nice....though I feel you have done a few disneylands they loose their appeal...was visiting one after almost a decade so was fun to see my son enjoy...loved the parade (which is much more hi tech than when we were young) and the fireworks,4
Put on your hat and bring your umbrella if you are visiting the park in summer time. Dodon't miss their parades and fire work.,4
2nd visit to Disney hk but found it more interesting now. My 4yo kid & 2yo kid enjoy their trip as they played about 10 games. Good !,4
"2 adults went to Disneyland for the first time. Beautiful theme park and very crowded as expected but we really enjoyed our day. Impressive quality of the rides & details of the toys, castle, etc.. everything was very expensive though (souvenirs & food). Feel bad for the staffs in the bakery section, as they looked super exhausted. the one who served us was being unfriendly & mistaken our orders.. other staffs were generally very professional & helpful",4
"It was level 3 Typhoon warning when I went there in the morning. The staff informed us that outdoor rides close and ask we wanted to come back another day. They told us no idea when they will open. But since our itinerary was all planned, we decided to go in. After few hours, warning level escalate to 8 and we were inform Park has to close. It wasdon't chaotic at all. People still strolling and looking around. Staff did I not really physically chase customer out. We quickly redeem our meal voucher and make our way out. Along the way we asked the staff and was told to keep the tickets as we can come back within 6 months with the same ticket. And so we did, on the next day afternoon, as the Typhoon came and left within a night. It was a good decision by my wife as the park is almost empty. We get to sit most of the rides without queue. Night parade and fireworks still on. But just a note that you need to go to the booth to exchange for a new ticket before entry. ",4
"We've never done any other Disneyland's so we cadon't compare there. This park was clean and friendly with no horrible lines, the app worked well for that. Food was expensive. Definitely a fun experience in Hong Kong!",4
"We enjoyed our family visit to Disneyland.Pros:  Excellent food court food, service and cleanliness.  Clean and spacious location.  Fast and friendly service.  The lines were not long (we visited on a weekday). Most ride wait times were 15 minutes with the maximum at 45 minutes (the scarier rides).Cons:   The park is a little dated.  The range of rides for older children is limited.I would visit again with younger children (or lovers of Disneyland).",4
"if i compare with Paris Disneyland , hong kong stands nowhere , comparatively small , however only one thing good about hongkong disneyland is shorter ques comparative to west",4
"They had an ongoing promotion of one day park ticket with a meal combo voucher for the same price. Available online, this was worth it. You have to redeem both the ticket and the meal voucher at their guest relations area. There was a still a lot of people considering it was a weekday but we had a relatively short waiting time for each of the rides except for the ones in Toy Story Land. Those had a waiting time of minimum 40mins. Overall we had a great time.",4
This is a great Place for Parents with young kids..Visit on a weekday as Weekends can be very crowded. Lots of rides to do with kids plus amazing shows to watch. Best rides to do are the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars and The Space Mountain. Best Shows to watch are Festival of the Lion King at Adventureland and Mickey and the wondorous Book at Fantasy Land. Kids will surely love these Musical shows. Plus watch out for the Disney Parade which happens at 4pm everyday. Do wait till 9pm at the Park to watch the Disney Fireworks... Out and out a great Place to spend time and enjoy with kids....,4
Spent several hours here after the passing of a typhoon.  The park was pretty empty and we were able to get on any ride we wanted with little to no wait.  This is the way to experience Disneyland!,4
"we went there on a very hot day, 32   to be exact. and some of us forgot a hat which was not a good idea! the rides, staff and service were excellent. highly efficient as Chinese tend to be. only reason why I diddon't give it 5 stars was the food served at the place, as expected was really quite mediocre. otherwise, for those with young children holidaying in Hong Kong, it is an unmissable stop.",4
"Our family had a great day at Hong Kong Disney. We were a little spoiled by having visited Disney World in Orlando quite a few times, but it was still really fun to find Disney spreading joy in Asia! It was hot, but the people of Hong Kong were so nice and gracious, this is the quality was there in the rides, food, and entertainment. Definitely worth your time! Price quite a bit lower than Disney World too.",4
"Magic, adventure and the world   s favourite cast of characters await. Embark on a journey with magical adventures for all ages! Hong Kong Disneyland offers immersive and unforgettable experiences that cannot be missed.Experience the magic of Disneyland Hong KongEnter seven themed areas based on your favorite Disney moviesMeet Mickey Mouse and all your favorite Disney charactersSee live parades and firework displaysMarvel at Cinderella's CastleWatch Broadway style showsWe bought the ticket online for 1 days pass gave us enough time to visit all the attractions inside the resort! It was amazing. The rides were good as expected but due to the heavy crowd and hot weather, the park should provide more sheltered areas for people waiting for rides. For many rides, waiting in the hot sun was most uncomfortable especially for children.Though I was disappointed that there is no vegetarian shops available at all. So my whole family could not get any food because we are strictly vegan but we managed and prepared some sandwiches before we begin out journey to Disneyland.Hong Kong Disneyland website stated that Food may not be brought into the Park but at the security point, they allowed and said it's ok. Unbelievable!",4
"I believe that it is the most smallest park of Disney in the world. The equipment and facilities are still good condition. However, most of the facilities are only suitable for young kids only",4
"Never been to a Disney before. Very impressive place. Certainly a full day's entertainment. Kids liked it ... as an adult I enjoyed it for their sake. Air conditioned shops pepper the landscape and draw in hot and sweaty punters. Then the relentless souvenir spending kicks in ! Just go with it. For some reason, I cadon't get  Holiday Road  out of my head. ",4
"A great attraction for families of all ages. Hong Kong Disneyland is a much smaller attraction than the original one in Anaheim, CA. My only disappointment with this theme park is that it does not have the Splash Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean and Thunder Mountain Railroad ride's, to name a few. However, you do get the same great feeling you get at the original Disneyland. Kudos to Hong Kong Disneyland for upholding Walt Disney's vision of bringing the  Happiest Place On Earth  to this city.",4
"The park was much better than expected. I think it's a great for all ages, everyone has something to do. The live shows were not magical as those of the US Disneylands                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ",4
"The park is kinda small but everything is well maintained. It was a rainy day when we went to the park and the lines were short, never had to queue more than ten minutes for any ride. My 5 year old daughter enjoyed her time there and played everything she wanted. The Wonderous Book show was interesting and the Lion King show was good too. But there was no parade in the evening due to the rain.",4
"It was the day after Tropical Cyclone Merbok, Storm signal 3. Before entering the theme park, the crew asked if I would want to consider returning another day or to proceed as some of the outdoor rides will be closed due to rain & park may be closed if weather decide to turn for worse. We thank her, went in nonetheless and there were the initial 30 minute queue to meet Mickey & Minnie at Town Square but there were quite a number of crew members helping out, speeding up the process to wait in the rain. Crew inside Main Street Corner Cafe provided impeccable service (fetching me a glass of warm water as I was feeling cold) and food was delicious (Singapore Laksa tasted better than what we have in Katong). The attraction queues for rides were extremely short and we only had to wait a maximum of 10 mins at most for some. We took a total 13 rides   meet & greet. The park was clean and my children had a blast. It was a pity that most of the street entertainment had to be cancelled in the day due to rain but when night falls & rain stopped, the Nighttime Spectacular  Disney Paint the Night  &  Disney In the Stars  Fireworks were absolutely wonderful! The crew's hardwork paid off as they brought smiles to my children.",4
This was my second visit. The first one was in Feb 2007. The attractions are old IMHO. USS Singapore is better in my opinion.,4
Lots of Disney characters and lots of shows for the kids. A bit disappointed as we were caught in the typhoon and the park was closed early. But the kids enjoyed the shows! It was great fun. The pooh ride as well as the Toy story ride was great fun for the kids!,4
"So I'm comparing this park to the one in California and it just doesdon't come close. It is so much smaller and just doesdon't have many rides. It's pretty and definitely clean but just lacking in attractions. I'm not sure if they plan on adding more, the park is not new. We went to Ocean Park a couple of years ago and that was much more fun. ",4
Although the overall area is not as big as some other disney land parks but I would still recommend to take the 2 day ticket specially if you want to cover all the attractions shows and also take pics with the characters. Would recommend to download the disneyland app so that you are updated on the show timings and the availability of characters in different areas at different times. Ofcourse do not miss the light and fire crackers show at the end of the day. Almost all the restaurants offer atleast 1 meal   menu option in vegetarian. ,4
"We have an 8 year old who would find a lot of the rides a bit boring. We focused on the rides with  big drops  (see HK DLand website)    Grizzly, Hyperspace, RC Racer, and Iron Man    and they were all fun rides. We rode the Grizzly 5 times, as the wait was less than 5 minutes (lucky considering it was a Sunday afternoon?). We also rode the Toy Soldier Parachute drop, which was fun, but way too short (less than 60 seconds) considering the long wait (25 minutes). There are 2 parades everyday    one at 3pm and one at 7:30pm. They are different, and both are fun to watch.Two things I would recommend everyone do. One, get the HK Disneyland app on your smartphone. It shows the wait time on each ride, so it helps planning on which ride to go to next. Two, eat before or after your visit, and bring a big bottle of water. I did not think the food was that great, and things are pricey inside the park.",4
My 2nd time in Disney HK. The new attraction Iron Man Experience fell short of my expectations. I dodon't know but the ride not excite me enough. There were not a lot of people when we went so lines are shorter. We watched 2 parades the one around lunch and the one in the afternoon. Both parades are short now. I think I remember the parades before were longer. We did not stay for the fireworks and evening parade. There were not a lot of character sightings also for picture taking. The only character we were able to take pictures with are BB8 and Chewbacca. We did not see the other characters. I still love Disney despite all this. Just wish that they could make the characters come out more for picture taking since there are a lot of Disney characters anyway so they can just rotate. I would have loved to meet the characters again. ,4
"We are a group of 5, 3 adults and 2 kids. Stayed at Kingdom Club. Wonderful service by staff in most places in its Hotel and Park. Dining with Characters was an organised one as the staff made sure Mickey, Minne, Pluto and Goofy visited every table. Well done for this. Kingdom Club was good for those with high budget, for 3 days 2 nights was about SGD4000. Room wise, except for 30 over bed bites on my legs and my sister's legs in Disneyland hotel bed near to the curtain, overall furnishings were quite old. Facilities were alright since most of the time, we were at the Park. We made two leisure walks from Disneyland back to hotel, time was about 15mins, we liked it and would do that again. Park experience, overall good except a few grumbling young ladies who were selling the ice cream and popcorns etc mobile booth outside TomorrowLand, probably due to hot weather. They shouted at the customers to queue up when there was no queue line in sight unlike other mobile booths. Waits for rides were about 45mins to 80mins. We had fast pass so not too bad for us. ",4
June is HOT HOT HOT so dress for the heat and humidity. Be sure to take lots of sunscreen and a hat. Toy Story has no shade so take the little ones there early otherwise it's just too hot in the summer! The park is well laid out and most of the staff speak English. The light parade and fireworks are great so be sure to stay and enjoy them. We spent 10 hours there and only saw 4 characters which was very disappointing. ,4
We've been to the Cali and Fla locations so heading here you'd find less. It's fun for the kids but for some strange reason the lines beefed up on Tuesday. It was unbearably hot this time of year. The food was so so at the park. The smiles and laughter though we're fantastic. ,4
"Based on other travellers' reviews, there are several things I can affirm. The meal coupons are really cost saving. The wait for the rides in June was short as there weredon't very much visitors. BUT the heat can easily cause sun burn. There isdon't very much cooling places to escape from, not very much seating for the elderly. You MUST look out for water coolers to refill your bottles. Other than that, it was a great experience.",4
Kids go crazy here!! Plenty of restaurants & snack stalls. A good place to spend your day with family. Lots of shopping as well.  What I liked   Iron Man 4D shows.,4
"Disneyland is cute and exiting for kids with it's theme which is visible anywhere you look, but the only thing is that their height limits are kinda high compared to Universal studios in Singapore for example. Our 3 year old daughter who loves fast rollercoasters, diddon't get to go on a single one, because she was 104 cm when the minimum height was more to some attractions. But she only complained for a minute and enjoyed every second in the other attractions for smaller kids, since they were so good and beautiful made. We saw a 30 minute musical about Lion king which was wonderful, and just a perfect little time for a 3 year old to hang on to. In the evening when Disneyland closed, a firework began behind the Disney castle. I was very impressed myself even if I'm 28 years old. That was definitely everything but a fiasco. The disney stores in the theme park are very crowded before closing so make sure you buy your souvenirs during the day time to avoid long lines. We went to Ocean park too. If you cadon't deside eather you should go to disneyland or ocean park, we definitely recommend disneyland. It's better, even for adults and I'm not a huge disney fan or anything. ",4
"Small place and lots of people, Have to line everywhere and every programme...But people were happy, a magic place worth to go...",4
Best for kids under tge age of 14. Not for adults or even teens. Not too many restaurant options. It's really not worth it. Just like any other theme park. The only thing worth was this magnificent Disney theatre show.,4
"if you are a big fan of disney, you have to visit HK disneyland. Although the rides are not very challenging comparing to other disneyland, but it's still is nice. Tip: be sure to go early and pre book your entrance ticket and meal online :) save the hassle. Also, dodon't waste time lining up to take picture with the disney mascots. Be sure to ride all the rides first",4
"Saw many kids here have their eyes sparkling with everything.Also saw many adult here have the sparkling eyes and laugh easier.Good place to visit as the family and a group of friend, so much fun with all the show they have.Long wait for the line even we do visit on week day though.",4
"It's not our first Disneyland visit and it is in fact one of the smaller one we visited but visiting with Kids is an all new ball game together.. Plus: Adequate stroller parking areas, kid friendly restaurants, wide spread of food available, good English speaking staff aroundMinus: character meet and greet schedules are mysteriously hard to find for us. We knew the Springtime Carnival and the fireworks timing (who doesdon't?) but character meet and greet is like a hit or miss. Still crowded, wondering if visiting in Winter will help. ",4
"I diddon't actually know there was a Disneyland in HK until we got there. I have been to the Disney in Orlando and California, and while there obviously there are way more attractions in Orlando, I would compare this park to the one in California. Prices are comparable to the other Disney parks. I went in May and was surprised to see the lines to get on rides were less than 20 minutes to get on. We did not wait longer than that for every ride, so we were able to go on all the large rides in a morning! (We are in our 30s, so did not go on the kids rides, however would have had time if we wanted to.) Over all fun visit   if you are looking to do something fun in HK! ",4
"The entrance and facilities , crowd control , ticket facility, commuting is well planned and appreciable. Inside the park the sections and it's details for all categories of ages are well planned and well maintained.  The parade and fireworks is a world class feature worth going for again n again. Kids will enjoy and thank their parents for the visit.  The food stalls and it's contents should be planned for all types of crowd as people around the world visit this park to enjoy.All types of cusines can be included in menu as far as possible.  Soveniour stalls are appreciable. Overall a classic place . Visit worth remembering for a lifetime.",4
"I was interested to see how Hong Kong Disneyland compared with the parks in Orlando and Paris. I wasdon't disappointed. I visited on a Thursday as having read many reviews I wanted to avoid the weekend when more local guests visit. I also opted for a Disney Dining package to cut down on costs. Travelled to the park using MTR from Hong Kong via Sunny Bay. Ordered tickets online and picked up at  Magic  collection booths to avoid queues. First off it's small, compared to WDW in Orlando it's tiny and even compared to Paris it's small. That said everything is really accessible, you can criss cross the park easily and I would say 1 day is more than enough to take in the major attractions and shows. If you do have small ones then maybe 2 days would be needed as it can get hot and the queues tend to be for the Fantasy land rides of which only the Winnie the Pooh ride has FastPass.Whilst I was there many of the food outlets were closed so I was restricted using my food vouchers, however there were 4 5 places I could use them. The food options are varied with both Western and Oriental options. Prices vary from HK$95 for a burger combo to HK$159 for a mixed grill combo. There are side dishes available too for uner HK$50.Main Street was crowded at the 10:30am rope drop as the Main Street is smaller than other parks but guests dispersed quickly and after heading straight to Tomorrowland there were no queues for Hyperspace Mountain   I rode 3 times without having to queue.Some areas open and close at different times   Grizzly Gulch opened at 11 and closed at 19:45   I'm assuming for  crowd  management and maintenance. Throughout the day I was able to re ride a few times on the main roller coasters without queueing   longest wait was 15 minutes on Runaway Mine Cars due to a hardware glitch.Many of the rides are similar to the US and Paris versions but with subtle differences. Space Mountain is tamer than Paris but racier than Orlando   no inversionsRunaway Mine Cars   has cool reverse section like Everest in Animal KingdomMystic Manor   Haunted Mansion 2.0  serious upgrade.Ironman Experience   Star Tours rebrand.Only 3 FastPass rides Hyperspace Mountain, IronMan experience and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh   nothing over in Grizzly Gulch or Toy Story Land.Lots of rides have indoor sections so you aredon't outside in the heat and humidity all day.Park was kept clean and tidy with no obvious signs of litter.All in all a great value day out.",4
"A piece of Americana in Asia. The only compromise to location is the food which is predominantly Asian style, which is not a problem, but if you after a Burger and Fries, you may have to plan ahead to find what you want. Can get very busy when there are a lot of 'pushy' tourists around.",4
"Disneyland will definitely bring out the child in you. It is indeed the happiest place on earth...so many rides to take although most of the attractions are for kids but one will still have a good time in the park. Dodon't miss out the parade bec it is where all the characters go out and dance. Upon entrance at the park, make sure that you'll get a guide map so you'll know what  world  you want to explore. It is also where you will see the schedule of shows. For those who doesnt understand Chinese, fall in line on the attractions with English guides. The fireworks are to die for, I dont know but it gives us goosebumps...maybe bec it brings out childhood memories in us. When you get to the train going to Disneyland, make sure that your cameras are ready bec it's just going to be a short ride. Everything inside the train is all about Disneyland.",4
"Easy to get to by MRT. Little bit of a walk to ticket gate but filled with the excitement of Disney on the way. Entrances a little slow, they check all bags. Not so much for safely but to make sure no food or drink brought in. Lines on a thur. Not bad. Some attractions where closed though, kind a disappointment. Not sure the cost of the pass to save on waiting in line but might be worth it! Lines even slower due to these people getting to go first.",4
"Sadly, compared to other Disneylands the Hong Kong version is not quite up to other versions. Whilst a two or sometimes three day visit to L.A or other parks, a day would complete Hong Kong D.L.The rides are average , but o.k and still scary for the newcomer. Though in truth all Disneylands have all the youngsters happily contentented, so dont let these words put you off. Still well worth a day's visit.",4
"Although the Disneyland is not very big, you can probably spend a day or two. We visited the theme park on weekday so we had no need to spend so much time to queue up. The roller coaster is not so scary but it's exciting. We also had lunch in the park. It's not cheap but relatively reasonable. It costs you HK$120 150 for a lunch with soft drinks. The food's not bad and we enjoyed sitting outdoor where we found very comfortable.Recommend to spend two days on weekdays. After that, you can go to nearby Tung Chung MTR station for shopping and dining. If time allowed, go to take the cable car in Tung Chung as well. The view is fantastic and there's a small interesting town in the terminus where it's worth to pay a visit.",4
"We absolutely loved this place. There were four of us, all in our mid 50's. We felt like young children again, going on rides, eating delicious food and having fun. The park was beautifully clean. Only issue was not such good weather. A must visit when visiting Hong Kong.",4
"This is always a good place both for kids and adults. Personally this is also the place where all staffs are friendly and genuinely tried to help you.I'm impress with the cleanliness of the toilet.It is pricey, but hey, it's worth it.Bring your own bottled water to save money. They have halal meal and praying room.",4
"No matter how old or young you are, Disneyland is a place to be. Hongkong Disneyland is far from the city, but transportation is not a problem. They have their own Disney train, complete with Mickey Mouse windows, that you can ride from Sunny Bay station going to Disneyland. If you are staying in HongKong central or Tsim Sha Tsui, it is a one hour ride and you have transfer trains. Before you enter the main gate to Disneyland Theme Park, there is a luggage storage area at the side so you could leave your things though I'm not sure if it's free. You can also but food for a much cheaper price outside, and of course, eat it there before going in. We availed our ticket from the host of our hostel and got it for a cheaper price and we were able to skip the long ticketing lines.Once you got in, you may get the map and attraction schedules on the side. This will help you decide where to go first and what time are the shows and parades. We went there on a Friday so the line wasdon't long. Toy Story attractions are more about rides and I suggest you visit that place first. There are restaurants inside Disneyland and they are expensive. About HK$130 for a full meal. But we got a discount coupon from the airport (Go to the tourism board booth) and we got 20% off on the meal we bought. The servings were big and good enough for 2 so you can share. The best place to watch the parade is on Main Street USA, beside the cafe. Check the schedule of the parade. When we went there last April, we watched the production of Lion King and it was really great. Dodon't miss out on watching these shows. Staff inside Disneyland give out stickers for free. If they dodon't give you one, you can ask them. The stickers are good souvenir and it's free! You can also ask them to take your pictures. Walking around Disneyland is tiring so dodon't forget to bring water and wear comfy shoes. For those who are wondering, it's HK$50 for a mickey mouse or ironman waffle. The ice cream is for HK$30.Dodon't forget to watch the fireworks display!",4
"It's really a fun and enjoyable place to be. But the queue for photo taking with characters was too long. Average waiting time for photo taking is at least 1hr, and it was during weekdays. Queue for rides took very long as well. We had to choose what we wanted to do and skipped the rest. Unless you for 2 days. Gotta get to the performance and fireworks area before it starts to get crowded. It a performance not to be missed.",4
"The smallest Disney Park in the world, but has the main key attractions that highlight the recent acquisition of the Star Wars franchise. It was busy, as it was a statutory holiday, but felt less crowded as waits diddon't need Fast Pass. An easy day visit via the MTR Subway. The International Food Court has an Asian bias, but looked better in the pictures than it tasted. I woulddon't plan more than one day there.",4
"Very small park, only the magic kingdom. Iron man experience was really good. Not a very good choice of disney merchandise. Enjoyed all the rides but unfortunately the weather was awful rained all day,",4
Visited the place in weekdays and enjoyed the rides with less queue time. My son so enjoyed this place that he wants to visit again. He likes most the adventure land.,4
"The place is really small and cozy. I think its great for toddlers that have just started to learn how to run. The place is small enough to catch them quick. Going on a weekday like we did also lessens the chance of losing your little one. Rides are almost all toddler friendly. My son had a blast! Although he only went on a few rides because he's an impatient little boy, he still had loads of fun running around the place. Food is quite expensive, since, my wife, son and I were really hungry we probably spent over HKD600 for lunch and snacks. But still we got to take home a really nice Mickey Mouse shaped lunchbox. All in all, we had a great time there. Everything is convenient. We brought our on stroller, but the place has strollers and wheelchairs for rent. Walking is a breeze. It's pretty much flat with little elevated areas making walking less tiring. Great place to bring the little ones. I feel like it's a prerequisite for the bigger theme parks as my son grows up.",4
It was a little smaller than expected.It was a raining day which highlighted the lack of cover from the rain. We managed to get to enjoy most of the attractions we wanted to.The lines were short and that was probably weather related.One day is probably enough.Overall an enjoyable day out.,4
"A great day out and a really cute mini version of a Disney park, no where near the size of Florida but a very nice park all the same.  Check what is open during their off season",4
"We spent whole day at Disney until fireworks still we only watch the show, a day tour is not enough, shows are all spectacular and amazing to watch, the day and night parade are superb, i'm 51 yrs old but at that time my fairy dreams comes true as if i was child, i recommend you take Iron Man experience wow, enjoy much the 12 minutes grandious fireworks, you will be amazed, will come back again to have pictures with my favorite disney characters ",4
"My boyfriend and I are two 23 y o Canadians and we had an amazing time at Hong Kong Disney. There was almost no line at all the rides which made it a lot more fun than other Disney parks. We paid about $100 CAD per ticket which is also cheaper than the other parks. (Look online for discounted tickets, at the park they are more) transport is very easy from just about anywhere in the city. ",4
I find many new attractions inside the park. The bus service from  the New Territories is easy for access to the park. Waiting time for many games is not too long.,4
"My wife and I had a great day here, riding rides and taking in the sites. It was our first time at any Disneyland, and we were very impressed overall. Our only complaint was the food quality. For the price we paid (yes, I know, Disneyland) we should have gotten better quality.",4
Had fun with family of 9.  Lines were not that long!  Have so many places where you can seat to rest.  Food and drinks a bit expensive,4
"Try to avoid weekends when visiting the disneyland. Visited on weekdays, the crowds are managable and the maximum queue time was 30mins. Try to go earlier to buy tickets before it gets crowded.",4
"Maybe due to the opening of Shanghai Disneyland, the queue wasdon't as long as before. Formerly we have to wait for 45 min for a kiddish ride, like Pooh Bear. Now, even for the latest ride   like Iron Man, the wait at the queue is about 15 min. The cut in the waiting time and good weather definitely contribute to the enjoyable experience in Disneyland. Do stay back for the Disney parade at night   very spectacular! Nice! ",4
Went there on a public holiday but the crowds weredon't too big.  Longest wait for a ride was probably 15 mins and we diddon't get fast passes. Smaller than the LA one but still good.  Plenty of shops for gifts and food and good rides.,4
"Have visited Disney parks in California and Florida, and recently had the opportunity to visit their park in Hong Kong. Getting here was very easy. The MTR provides Disney park with its own line. You can get to the park from pretty much anywhere the MTR services Hong Kong. We made our visit on a Tuesday ( May 2nd). Arrived there just minutes before the park opened (10:30am). Pleasantly surprised with the small crowd. The park entrance is very wide and clean. Landscaping is traditional Disney. As you pass the entrance (the main train station ) and walk into  Main Street, USA  you will understand why I chose the title   it's a small world after all . Had I done some research prior to coming I would have not been surprised by how small this park really is. It's nearly one fifth the size of Magic Kingdom in Florida. Aside from the small scale , the park is very much  Disney . Tarzan's tree house was closed for maintenance. This has a big impact considering the few attractions in the park. For the roller coaster enthusiasts , I recommend the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. I wodon't give it away just suffice it to say there are surprising maneuvers. Over all a fun park despite its small size ( you can easily cover the entire park at a leisurely walk in less than 5 hrs, just my opinion). Expect hefty prices for any and all goods you purchase in the park. Most park employees speak English enough to communicate with you. We were pleased to find most employees had left the Honk Kong attitude at the gate. Get a bench early (6 6:30pm) in front of the castle for a good view of the fireworks. Park closes promptly after the pyrotechnics (8:00pm). There are plenty of trains to take you back to your destination so no need to worry. Overall a pleasant experience , but the size of the park was disappointing. ",4
"Smaller than Anaheim park and is like a minipark compared to Orlando. Easy to navigate and shorter distance between attractions. They have multiple languages to suit the needs of the customers. There are rides that are different than the US parks. Expensive because the entrance fee is just slightly lower than the US park. However, you go on more rides as the line ups are shorter. Very easy to get there as the MTR goes to the front entrance.",4
"It is a nice attraction for family and children but if you stay in Hong Kong it is not a priority. More or less is the same of the other Disneyland around the world. A little bit difference for food arranged for Asian taste,",4
"This park is definitely smaller than the parks in the United States, but still lots of fun. Loved the Mystic Manor ride and Buzz Lightyear shooting ride. For the Jungle Cruise, they have three lines for three different languages, one of them being English. Plenty of food options through out the park. ",4
"I will never forget my Disney adventure in my entire life. Although it was just over a half day's visit and my group wasdon't able to explore every nook and cranny, still the experience was terrific!I am very much enchanted by the grand parade and the magnificent fireworks that capped the day's events...so mesmerizing! I also particularly enjoyed the jungle cruise where the sights of animals seemed real. And of course the different rides that we had...brought on memories of my happy childhood (sentimental feelings).The destination is really a must see when you're in Hong Kong.",4
"Very glad we purchased two day tickets as it was crazy busy (due to being holidays in China and lots of people visiting HK). Heat was incredible on Wednesday   saw two different people require medical attention due to queuing in the sun. Waited to see Mickey for nearly an hour and gave up as there were still at least 50 people in front of us (even though we were told it would take one hour when we joined the queue, that was also in full sun). The queues for photos with the characters were full of adults and no consideration was given at all to families with kids. I know everyone pays to get in, but does every adult really need a professional photo with Mickey and Minnie and then take another 10  posed photos with their own camera?!?!?! Time limits need to be set, ie each  group  (and not each individual) has xx time with the characters so the queue actually moves.Got the MTR to Disneyland from Kowloon   easy but busy.Food choices available and prices ok (paid about AU$60 for four people at the Tomorrowland dinner   burgers etc). Still cadon't believe I paid HK$32 for an iceblock but it was so incredibly hot there was really no choice.Kids had a ball, which was the main reason we attended.",4
Fantastic 1st trip to Disneyland. It was pouring down but that diddon't dampen our spirits. They sold Ponchos etc. The queues were quiet but unfortunately the outside rides were closed. The whole place was magical (even if I am in my late 20's). I've never been a huge Disney fan but I would highly recommend it. ,4
"Spent a full day at Hong Kong Disney and the whole themed park is well designed with lot of rides for children and adults.Customers can use their tickets for the fast lane at selected rides like the iron man and Winnie the Pooh ride. My favourite rides would be the star wars and the hot wheel rides which are fun.You can easily find food and drink stalls within the themed park, including bathroom.They also have luggage storage facility for tourists (located before the Disney entrance) and stroller rental in the premise.Do stay till the evening to watch the fireworks. Overall, it was a fun experience especially for guests who grew up watching Disney cartoons.Tips: drink lots of water, wear a hat and apply sunblock.",4
"I remember first going to HK Disney and thinking it was quite small, now they have two new areas open (and a third coming soon) which has improved it no end, but it still feels small compared to the other Disney Parks around the world. Regardless of that, it is a lovely afternoon to spend with the family and if you go on the right day then you are not going to be queuing any more than 15 minutes for the rides. The parade and fireworks in the evening are also great.",4
"We visited HK Disneyland during the week of Easter and Good Friday. It was not as busy as most locals had travelled outside of HK. The wait for the rides was not long at all. Our average wait was 20 minutes. The staff there was nice. I have to say that the food at the park is very expensive. Overall, it was better than the first time I had been there since my 7 year old son came with me this time around.",4
"As lovers of all things Disney, the park was accessed via the very efficient rail system  culminating in a Disney train complete with Micky shaped windows etc. the crowds seemed smaller and younger with most little girls attired in a princess dress   very cute. The rides are provided to suit the whole family participating which is really nice. Some rides albeit a bit extreme were enjoyed by young and old alike with no tears or tantrums. Some of the rides  amusements were better than Anaheim and these included the mystic mansion, Disney garden and Toy Story rides. Front of the line passes were available for some rides with the younger rides such as Pooh Bear requiring the longest wait. The food and facilities were excellent and grounds pristine. The new Marvel ride and the Disney Musical experience was great with large groups of people accommodated at each session reducing the wait time. Great gift shops and Pandora now provided exclusive Disney options. Western options available in a cute cafe in Main Street with amazing children's meals. A magical day   however mid week attendance highly recommended   avoid weekends at all costs. ",4
We visited for the day and had an excellent time. Staff good but not like the happy cheerful American staff. Not too busy   never waited more than 20 minutes for a ride. Parades good. Food on site adequate.  Lots of good rides.,4
"Quite a small Disney by all accounts and when we went it was extremely busy with most rides having a 45 min wait, some as much as 1.5 hrs! Easy to get to by MTR, but make sure you have enough credit on your Octopus for the return journey! If you stay to the end of the fireworks expect the MTR to be very bust indeed, but they diddon't let it get too overcrowded.Some of the attractions were being renovated, but the major hit with our 4 year old was the Ironman Experience which was worth the wait.",4
We stayed at one of the hotels at Disneyland and the rooms were very spacious and well appointed. The crowds were very manageable being there in March. Our only complaints were the bar in the hotel was closed and the parachute ride was out of service. The other rides were great and the kids had lots of fun. Our granddaughter and her grandmother(on her 75th birthday) rode the roller coaster.,4
"Get family days with our 7 and 9 year olds, My 7 year old was tall enough to go on all the rides and my 9 year old was still young enough to still want photos with Mickey and Minnie. Only complaints I have is Mickey and Minnie need to be out way more for photos everyone wants photo with them and there hardly out. Another is common curtesy a certain type of guest have not idea on queuing and covering mouths when they cough and does no selfie sticks mean no selfie sticks, this should be enforced more. Got so feed up people standing in busy walkways to pull out the selfie stick and pose for photos of themselves ",4
"We went on a regular Friday around 11am under the cloudy sky. Not many people & we needed max 10 min for a ride if there was a line. Some ride we went 2, 3 times in a row without waiting at all, unbelievable!!!I went to Disney Tokyo & Paris, it's smaller. Good if you have smaller kids. Main languages are Cantonese, English & Mandarin.Now it's not allowed to use the selfie stick in the park & I dodon't see clear indication at the door. The staff sometime screamed at the microphone for some people who diddon't understand & the people were really crazy, ignored them too...Toilets are everywhere & it's very clean with staff often cleaning. Souvenir shops are at all the corners waiting for you to spend money.Baby facilities available. Can leave the pushchair just outside the attraction in a special area, sometimes there is someone keep an eye of the area.Last year I went into Space mountain with my 6 year son then, without knowing how it was exactly, however I've asked if he's allowed to go on & he was tall enough, & we would be sitting next to each other. Anyway, it was so scary that I thought he would fly out of the car anytime. This time the Ironman area was built. We visited the Ironman experience. We took our time to ask questions & got detailed answer. If I'm not wrong, there are 4 (cinema liked) rooms, this means less waiting time. It was a tour visit of HK but with Ironman & monster in between, 3D, air, chair moving experience. Nice atmosphere with everyone was laughing & screaming.The ride is fairly short, a min or 2. Sometime the staff spent so much time to check all the doors were closed & secure than the ride.Moneywise, I found it's quite expensive for the daily extrance fee (1 Adult HKD 589) , as well the food, a simple meal easily cost HKD 100. There is a 2 days' pass which you can use 2 times within 7 days period, that's much more interesting (1 Adult HKD 759)Overall, if you're well prepared, it would be a pretty good experience with your kids.",4
"Disneyland Hong Kong is the smallest of all the Disneyland parks but it has been expanding with new rides such as the Mystic Manor and Ironman Experience.Went during the May Day long weekend Sat and it was packed as usual but manage to take a record of 10 rides due to the longer operating hours. Yes 10 rides is nothing to most people but for us who will que for an hour just to have a few minutes of photo taking with Mickey and Minnie, this is an achievement in itself. If it was winter period where sunset is earlier, will not be able to meet it to 10 rides since a fraction of the riders were done in evening.Noticed considerably lesser China tourists than before.Take the meal and ride combo package which offers good value for lunch but food was nothing to shout about however the portion huge.",4
My first visit to HK Disney which I enjoyed very much as it is only small and wasn   t too busy. I have only been to the parks in America but I would recommend HK if visiting Disney with small children as by comparisons it   s a manageable size.,4
"Just like any other Disneyland in the world, this small theme park will make any adult feel like children again. Though it been 11 years since it opened, you wodon't feel like that. I could see that they keep upgrading it anytime new Disney's character coming. I went there first time in 2013 and there was no fairy tale garden at that time. This is my third times visiting HK Disneyland and I always feel enchanted with their magical atmosphere. Though this park a way much smaller than any other Disneyland, but they keep it compact and attractive. And since a new Disneyland opened in Shanghai last year, so there was less tourists from Mainland China (which is good for me). I recognize that all staffs can understand at least 3 languages; cantonese, mandarin, and english in quite good. Keep performance well! ",4
Fantastic theme park. Fun for all ages.   Lose 1 star for the lack of vegetarian & vegan food options.,4
"Small but perfectly formed, we've visited Eurodisney and compared to there it's smaller. However it also makes it more manageable time wise and for a day visit. Longest queue time was an hour but most rides were 30mins or so during our visit. Rides for young and big kids at heart! Lots of food stations and restaurants dotted around, toilets were clean and plentiful. There wasdon't a parade at the end of the day due to the fact it had rained and health & safety because of this. However we stayed for the fireworks and this made up for it, worth staying for. MTR links were quick and direct and not too bad when exiting after the fireworks despite the big crowds.",4
"Admittedly I have never been to other Disneylands, so I dodon't have a point of comparison, however I thought that HK Disney was pretty good. It is not a large park, but large enough when time was limited. I visited on a Saturday and most rides had long lines. It is worth downloading the App as it updates the wait time for rides and was handy in providing general information about the park. Gift shop was extensive in its range. We purchased some mouse ears and they threw in embroidery of the child's name, which was great. Food wasdon't bad and they also had gluten free items on the menu which was unexpected. The site including railway station and grounds were well maintained and the Disney train was super cute with the Mouse shaped windows. Good value for the price and greatly enjoyed by the family.",4
"Indeed the Hongkong Disneyland is a good experience specially the parade and the fireworks. Most of the rides were really made for kids. Some of it I got bored. Three times we fell in line and after waiting for sometime they told us there is a technical problem.Can be access by MTR.Regarding food, yes, it is expensive. But, there is a fast food inside near the Marvel area that sells 2pc chicken, 1 rice, 1 drink, and fries for 99hkd. The chicken are relatively big so you can just buy another rice and drink and make the meal for two.They will search your belongings if there are food.Recommended time to use here is opening till fireworks.",4
This is our second trip here. It's great with young children especially due to its smaller size and more kid friendly rides. They dodon't have to walk as far. It was a little disappointing that the Lion King show was not on as it is a definite highlight of the park. The ground crew are not as  smiley  when compared to the Tokyo parks. Most people flock to Fantasy park but dodon't forget about the Toy Story section especially if you have young children. ,4
"It is a place which our family always go. Well, nice staff and nice attractions. We did enjoy the park because it has a number of kids friendly facilities and equipment. You cannot compare this with the other Disneyland in other countries regarding the size but it is enough for you to spend one day.Recommended:1) Install the Apps then you know the waiting duration for each attractions and the timeslot for entertainment.2) reserve the restaurant once enter the park if you want to get a good position to watch night parade and firework.3) Try the new ironman attraction, it is quite interesting.",4
"HK Disneyland is small but that is more of a positive, we purchased two day pass and the Easter Sunday was quiet with q was no more than 30mins be prepared when it does get crowded it can take longer and it can be overwhelming. My family have gone to Disneyland Orlando, CA and that was our bench mark, however KL Disneyland had their charms and still we had a magical experience. As always use fast pass when you can and keep hydrated in the warmer months. Technically we could of done the whole park in one day but wanted to take it easy and our time, the new Iron Man experience was new as was some of the other rides. Toy Works was a hoot and the kids loved it. They have a dedicated train to DL via the MTR whiich is super efficient. Highly recommend to people who are first time visitors.",4
We visited there at Easter Sunday. It was not so crowded and 30 mins Q time in average. My personal opinion is half day is good enough to explore. But make sure you got to stay till the end to experience the night light parade and fireworks. ,4
"Our visit was cut short by heavy rain, but the parade before this was great to see. Did not get a chance to go on many rides. Overall smaller than Tokyo Disney. But still a magical experience.",4
"From what I've previously heard it's not a small park, like many have said. It's a clean place and well organised. Services are ok but the restaurants have expensive prices for the varieties of foods they have to offer. The rides were high quality. Dodon't go on a rainy day. ",4
"DOdon't. expect a trip to be comparable to Florida or California. This park is much smaller. But that does have benefits. Queues tend to be much quicker,especially midweek and the park is very easy to navigate.Some rides have different queues for mandarin,cantonese or english commentaries..Very clean.Good selection of both Asian and western food outlets.Best way to travel there is on the mtr   cheap, fast and reliable",4
"I have been to the parks in the USA. This park is like a small version of those. It has a couple of the standards like It's a Small World and the Jungle Cruise (in Chinese or broken English   your choice). It has one great ride in Mystic Manor, which is really cool. Otherwise it is small Disney. Easy to do in one day. Buzz Lightyear is very fun.",4
My family of 2 adults and 3 kids really loved our day in Hk disneyland. We all love the iron man experience and mickeys philharmonic. Although the lines in the shows where a little chaotic it could not dampen our enjoyment..well its not call the happiest place on earth for nothing!,4
"I guess it's pretty obvious that there cadon't be much that isdon't fun about going to any Disneyland right. It's very easy to get there using the subway and also very affordable and safe. This was a really good month to go as the lines weredon't long at all which made it even more pleasant. Some of the rides etc were close but it diddon't matter. Food and cool drinks (and even water) are very pricey, you can pay up to 40 HKD for a water. There's quite a few restaurants, mostly traditional Asian food with a few  American  food stalls here and there. Overall, an amazing experience. And staying for the firework show over the castle at 8pm is definitely worth it. ",4
Going to Disneyland with the kids is always a great time. They had several rides that were unique and well worth the trip. The kids loved the live shows and the fireworks. It is a tad small and two days was more than enough. The western food was of poor quality but the Chinese food was great.,4
It's very fun and enjoy play in the Disney theme park. But very crowded and long Q for all the games.,4
We buy two day tickets and no need to rush. The park is not much big and could be visit all activities within a day. The HK DISNEY app is good to located to place and waiting time.,4
"The only downfall was the unfortunate rainy weather whoch meant the parade had to be cancelled but the fireworks still went off with a bang!Plenty to do and see, not the largest of parks but theyve maximised the space.Food and drink avalible throughout the park and personally didnt think pricing was too bad, same as souvenirs. I purchased a tshirt for HK $200.Wasdon't on my list of places to see in Hong Kong but glad we went. Trains run frequently to the park as well",4
"I'm writing this review so that other travellers can get an idea of how busy it is at Hong Kong Disneyland during the Ching Ming festival. I could not find any information about how busy it would be on this particular public holiday so hopefully this information will be helpful for someone else.As we came in on a cruise we coulddon't pick our day of arrival (or the time unfortunately) As a result we arrived late in the afternoon. Yes it was a little crowded but we diddon't have to queue more than half an hour for our desired rides. We diddon't get to check out all the classic rides at Fantasyland because we ran out of time. This was because we were forced to arrive so late in the day, not because we spent ages queueing elsewhere in the park.The only rides that we saw queues that went for more than an hour were in the Toy Story area. Luckily we weredon't too fussed about going on them.This is definitely a park for younger children. We had children aged from 5 to 11 and they all loved it. None of the roller coasters have loops and the rides dodon't go too high on the thrill factor. The only characters we lined up for were at Tomorrowland. The line to see both BB8 and Chewbacca were really short. No one in our party were particularly interested in seeing Mickey and Co. so I coulddon't tell you how long the wait was. Ask every staff cast member that you see if they have stickers. We became obsessed with collecting them.We bought the play and dine offer available on the website which meant that we got a free meal. The staff at the restaurant in Tomorrowland were really helpful to explain what we could order. The food was of a theme park standard. Plenty of western options available if your young one isdon't open to trying the Asian options.Our highlights were the fairy garden, mystic manor, hyperspace mountain and the awesome fireworks show at the end of the day.I also had trouble trying to find out how much the Minnie Mouse ear headbands cost before coming to the park so here's the prices as at 4th April 2017: The headband with sequins was HKD138 and the plain polka dot ones were HKD118. My boys weredon't really interested in the options available for them so I cadon't tell you how much the goofy hats cost.If there's a good deal going on cheap flights to Hong Kong i'm tempted to try and visit with the kids again (if only to get all the stickers, mwah hahahahaha!)",4
Hk Disneyland has grown over the years and there is now so much more to see and do.  Shame that only every second toilet was available for use ...made queues quite long in some areas.  Waste of valuable time !,4
They have expanded the park over the years and it wasdon't crazy busy even though it was a Sunday. The new iron man experience is pretty cool and buzz light year is always fun. Enough to do for a full day now that the park has expanded over the years. ,4
"Visited the Hong Kong Disney park during our stopover.As others have said, the park is not huge but has some good rides for all ages. we were able to fill pretty much a full day (despite awful weather) and the park is easily accessible on the MRT (with Disney themed trains)",4
"This place was on our bucket list. So visited with our children. Overall a nice place. Typical Disneyland. We booked tickets through Klook, which got us Auto magic access without any need to wait in ticket lines. Automagic is nothing but getting your printed tickets from a machine by using QR code on your Klook tickets. So we just walked in within no time. All attractions are very nice. But the highlight is Disney Character parade during the day and in the evening with fireworks. The only difference is that the parade songs are in Mandarin language. A must do attraction is R Racer in Toy Story land something very thrilling. Make sure that you occupy the benches in front of Castle at around 615 630pm. That's the place with the best view of evening parade and fireworks. ",4
"As far as Disney goes this is a clean and friendly park. Everything stocked and open. Can do this in 2 full days with children. The lines aredon't long. Except if you want a photo with characters Mickey and Mini  get there as soon as they open or half an hour before and go to the main circle and start lining up first. The first day we caught the train from central HK city  terrible idea   took too long to get there. Caught an uber home. Very quick, luxury and not too much more than the train (family of 5). Next day uber there and back. The only downside I would say is lack of food options and availability. If you're travelling with young children take food and drinks. It takes too long to go and find a food stall and then when you do they only serve the same thing   nothing healthy. ",4
"Its like any other Disney theme park with multiple zones. We liked the Tomorrow Land, Toy Story Land and the Grizzly Gulch. Unfortunately on the day of our visit, a lot of rides and restaurants at Adventure Land were closed. We enjoyed every bit of our stay but the queue lines were a bit long for comfort. If there are not enough people, park staff should open up gates so that visitors do not have to traverse the longer routes.",4
"It's nice to be in Disneyland. It's makes me relax and happy. Going back to be a child again. No problem, no worries, very happy.",4
Many say HK Disney is smaller that some of its overseas cousins.....so what !everything is there and the only suggestion I would make is to do your research and get there early in the day as the crowds increase as the day goes on.We were there this month ( April) so the weather was near perfect.If you lan to have a sit down lunch hit that early and enjoy more attractions while others are in the lunch queue !,4
"I'd never been to a Disney park before, so I have nothing to measure it against the others around the world, but compared to other amusement parks I have visited, this was very slick, very clean and very well run   as you'd expect. I dodon't think I saw a queue of more than 40 minutes, however, nearly all of the lines for the rides I went on were no more than 20 minutes in duration. All of the staff (or cast as they're called) were on the ball and helpful   you can see how well they're trained. The parades were choreographed to perfection and wowed the youngsters. My only gripe... in all of the shops I visited (and there are many), I coulddon't find a single book for my kids   surely people want more than t shirts, cuddly toys and action figures still... dodon't they? ",4
This a quite a small Disneyland in comparison the California but is still good fun. I did think the staff wore very dull clothes as did Mickey and Minnie. I have been to other disneyland and the staff wear brightly coloured clothing so they are distinctive. A few more eating places would have been helpful.,4
"People say disney parcs are the happiest places on earth. It's true. The parc is not that big but perfect for a day trip. You can do everythin in one day, if you dodon't have to cue too long. Make sure to avoid weekends or public holidays. Since last time we went the added the irin man and star wars attractions. Both were fun. The parc is, together with hong kong off course, a must do in Asia (with kids).",4
Second visit to a Disneyland after a family trip to California 12 years ago. 15 of us ranging from 15 to 76 years of age and the park did not disappoint. Much smaller than the original but enough to keep all excited and engaged for a full day.,4
"Been there back in 2009 , and the park has not changed that much . The train ride around the park was so bad . After one stop they made you get off and get back in line for the next one . My wife complained as I am disabled but they did not care .Still a fun pace to go ",4
Get there for it opening   we went in April and waited no more than 10 minutes for a ride   most 5 mins or straight on. Plenty of eating options and big range of souvenirs to buy. MTR very easy and cheap to get there. ,4
"Notes on my review; my wife and I went as a couple to HK (diddon't bring the kids along) and were on a tight budget. We havedon't been to any other Disneyland theme parks. But we definitely made this as a  cannot miss  itinerary during our first visit to HK. 1). Be prepared for a lot of walking   It is a large theme park, so make sure you wear comfortable shoes (or slippers sandals), bring sufficient drinking water (depending on how much hydration you need), and wear comfortable clothing (depending on weather forecast or season). Moving from one theme area to another involves quite a lot of walking if you sum it all up. I had my pedometer on and clocked over 13k steps for the whole day we spent there. 2). Buy your ticket online   Decided to buy our tickets online to save a bit and avoid the queue at the ticket booths there. So when we got to Disneyland we were able to skip the line for tickets and went straight to the entrance. (We went on a weekday so I noticed the line wasdon't so bad. But it does add to the time you waste waiting in line) 3). Allocate a whole day for this visit   With the size of the park, plus the different attractions, rides or activities. You definitely will need to plan this as a whole day visit. We were there from 11am to 8pm (to watch the fireworks) and we were just a couple visiting. If your bringing children along, being earlier (be there by 10am) will definitely give you a more relaxed pace to go around and enjoy a lot of the attractions. 4). Weekend or Weekday?   Important note, we went on a weekday so I dodon't have first hand experience on weekend volume of people (its just a hunch). If milling around in a park with a LOT of people trying to get in line to the different attractions is NOT your thing then I suggest going on a weekday. Fewer people   shorter lines   more attractions to visit or ride. Granted there are some attractions that might be closed, but its just a handful so it was not a big deal for me. Longest wait time we had for an attraction was at the carousel and it took us approx 10mins to get seated. I can just imagine the weekday crowd pushing the wait time to at least twice that duration (just a hunch). 5). Bring your own water and food   being on a budget, we brought our own food and water. At first I was thinking these might not be allowed but we got them through and saved some money. For portability we brought a few sandwiches and 3L of water (for the both of us). 6) Notes on gadgets   make sure your phones cameras are fully charged and bring extra powerbanks and maybe memory (if you tend to take a ton of pictures and videos) if your phone camera has limited capacity. Having pictures and videos of your visit is a mortal sin (okay, not a sin but helps build nice memories) when visiting Disneyland. There are also certain areas with free wifi in the park so that helps you in updating your twitter, instragram or facebook accounts as you are experiencing the wonder of Disneyland. 7). Check the schedule of activities on their website or app   To make sure you dodon't miss on any major shows   activities. Make sure to check their website or app for whatever is happening on the day you plan to visit. This will help you decide what to watch or visit as some shows or activities overlap one another. 8). Check the HK forum for advice, suggestions and tips on Disneyland   I'm an organized   planning person, so doing research on where I'm visiting is a must. Check the HK forums here at Tripadvisor and you'll get tons of advice or answer to questions.",4
"GET THERE EARLY! Being the first time at this park I thought it was ok. I would love to bring the grandkids here as they would love it. I enjoyed all the attractions. Two were closed for refurbishment so if you are keen on a particular area, I would contact ahead to avoid any disappointment. Reasonably priced as far as parks go. Overall, great for kids. One thing to mention, the boat ride can scare the really little ones as I observed one poor little fella upset with the noise.",4
"Convenience, Staffs are friendly ,, there are not many rude mainland ppl,, didnt need to line up for long time for rides,   There are several restaurants provide nice food.",4
Do not expect Hong Kong Disney to be anything like FLORIDA or even LA.But the park is to the usual high standard you can expect from Disney with many of the all time favorite attractions and a few new ones as well.Stay for the parade and the fireworks to make it a full day,4
"My friends all told me to visit on a weekday and i sure am glad i listened to them, i diddon't have to wait long for most of the rides, so yes,,, try and come on a week day.This is my first visit to a Disney Land and its pretty cool, the food is definitely pricey, but you expect that for an attraction, plan to spend the whole day here to get your moneys worth, say till the end for fireworks etc.It seemed large to me at first, but a few days later i visited the Tokyo Disney land and USJ in Osaka and this is definitely smaller. Overall great for kids and adults but just be careful as some of the rides are not explained properly and young children while they might be taller enough still might not like the twists and turns...",4
"We had a great couple of days at Hong Kong Disneyland with our three small children. It was small enough to get round in two days and all the children were able to go on enough rides together that it made it worthwhile. We have visited three other Disney lands worlds across the world and this is definitely the smallest, but perfect for young children. The major issue at the park is the staff   they are definitely lacking the Disney magic that you come to expect, especially in the American parks. They are often rude and very unhelpful, although you do come across the odd gem! We went on a Sunday and a Wednesday and the weekday experience was definitely way more enjoyable than the weekend which was VERY busy! Get there early, go and fast pass Winnie the Pooh first and you will have a fab day.",4
Reached Disneyland station by around 10in the morning the park opens by 1030 so be there early! Book ticket online to avoid the rush there !!   Usual rush of 20mins per ride but choose your area first I would prefer going to the jungle river...More,4
After massive cues rides and restaurant were really good.  Small and manageable to navigate This Disney was perfect for a day.,4
The place is a replica of the ones in LA and Florida though much smaller in size. The security gong in is rather tight to prevent anyone bringing in food of their own. Restaurants inside are lousy!,4
"The park is great for day out with children. The size is not that big, so can cover in one day, however the queue times can be long, as it is popular.",4
"Conveniently located; easy access to MTR. I went on a Monday and luckily it was not crowded. the maximum wait time i had for a ride was 20 mins. i went to all the rides. Lot of Children friendly rides. My 9 year old son enjoyed every moment of it, the Iron Man ride and Star Wars ride in tomorrow land were worth mentioning. Icing on the cake were the Parade of Mickey and gang and the Fire works display. A must visit in HK",4
"Having seen Disney LA and Florida, the Disney setup in HongKong might slight not match up to the standards. You had the IronMan meet and greet which my son enjoyed. The only plus was since the setup was not as big, we could easily cover the entire attraction in a single day. Overall,my kids enjoyed and had a blast.",4
"More for the kids than adults, although there's plenty to see and do. Disneyland offers a variety of rides, sights, and character spotting is lots of fun! Take the Disneyland train MTR to the Disneyland station. The restaurants inside are relatively expensive. There are plenty of opportunities to purchase souvenirs, although they too are a little on the more expensive side. Loads of rides experiences   the kids will love it.",4
We were surprised that we diddon't have to wait long to the rides and attractions. Even the restaurants were not full. Flowers and Easter eggs abound the place. It was sunny but the weather was cool. We were so tired but the kids had a lot of fun. ,4
Was surprised how small this park was compared to others.  Was able to get around with ease and hardly any lines.  Food is not of high quality.  Park well maintained.,4
"Great amusement park. Lots of rides, shows and photo spots. Rides   from merry go rounds to roller coasters. ( there is a ride even for the disabled wheelchair bound )Shows   wide range   from street shows to live performances to 3 4d animations.Dodon't miss the lion king show it's Awesome!Photo spots   with ur favourite characters, nature spots, castles and more.Wide range of restaurants, shops for Souvenires.Do not miss the Disney in the stars show at 8:15pm   a spectacular fireworks and projection at display. Tip: Catch a place near the castle at USA street early.If you are visiting the park on Sundays or holidays better to opt for the fast VIP pass as the queues are long and waiting times may be as long as 30 45min. Tip: better to book a weekday  non holiday.There is a MTR to Disneyland   use it to get there faster and more conveniently.Travel light with kids for maximum fun.",4
"We had a pleasant day at Hong Kong Disney, it is small compared to USA Disneyland and Disney World however worth a visit.  We are a couple in our early sixties but still enjoyed the rides and had a great time on them.",4
Pretty small Disneyland compare to other parks around the world. Could be completed in just half day. Easy access via train service. Rides are okay. Food and drink are similar to other parks.,4
You cadon't miss visiting Disneyland when you're in Hong Kong. Especially when travelling with family. Great for kids especially below 12.,4
"I've been to Disneyland in Anaheim, California and Disney World in Orlando, Florida in the United States, and this is definitely the most compact Disney park I've been to. But there is an advantage to its small size: You walk less. This is especially advantageous if you have very young children. In Disneyland or Disney World, you must do so much walking that even the adults poop out after half a day. The HK Disney Park is so compact and if you go on a weekday, you could finish visiting the Park in half a day! I was there today, arriving by MTR in the morning at about 10:45 (It opened at 10:30). There were no long lines awaiting to go in. I went straight to the entrance turnstile and show the attendant my ticket code (I ordered the ticket online early in the morning), and he processed my ticket immediately. I walked down Main Street (by passing all the photo opportunities with Disney characters) and went straight to Tomorrowland. There I immediately went to the Iron Man ride which I expected to be the most crowded since it's Disney's newest ride. I was surprised that I was in my seat within 10 minutes. I followed it with Hyperspace Mountain, Starwars Command Post, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster and Orbitron (since all were in Tomorrowland), and all waited no more than 10 minutes. I then went to the next theme section, Fantasyland, and tried their most popular ride, Winnie the Pooh, and once again the wait was no more than 10 minutes. I followed that ride with one of Disneyland's best known, It's A Small World, was able to walk right in. Then went to see the shows Mickey and the Wondrous Book and Mickey's PhilharMagic, and once again walked right in without waiting. I wanted to watch Festival of the Lion King in Adventureland but it was closed until April. So I went to Grizzley Gulch but decided I did not care to ride the Mine Cars Rollercoaster so I proceeded to the Mystic Manor which is similar to the old Haunted Mansion and once again was in within 10 minutes. I entered the park at 10:45 a.m. was actually ready to leave at 3:00 p.m. If it were not for the afternoon parade which started at 3:45 p.m. I would have departed at 3:00 p.m. I did not have to use the Fast Pass feature of my ticket at all and was able to repeat a couple of rides with very little waiting. So from this, I conclude that you can do this park in one day if you go on a weekday and arrive by opening time. But like all Disneylands, I recommend you have a plan of routing before going to save yourself time and unnecessary steps. Here are some of my suggestions after being there today: 1. Order your tickets online to save waiting in line to purchase tickets. 2. Bring water and small snacks (cookies, chocolate bars, trail mix packs) but leave your lunch size sandwiches behind as park security will not allow bringing food items into the park.3. The MTR ride from the Hong Kong Station to the Disney Station takes at least half and hour, so allow yourself adequate time for transportation in order to get there by opening time.4. Once you enter the park, by pass photos with all the Disney characters on Main Street and go to the Information Board to the right of the Circle before reaching the Castle and check ride closures and show parade times. 5. Then head straight for the first ride on your planned route. Most people in Hong Kong dodon't seem to be early birds so you should not have to wait long for these first few rides.6. Be sure to work in the shows into your schedule: Mickey & the Wondrous Book, Mickey's PhilharMagic and Festival of the Lion King. 7. Lastly, also work in the afternoon and the evening parade (if you're staying til closing) as well as the fireworks show to complete your Hong Kong Disney adventure.",4
"so easy to get to here, thanks to Disneyland Line. I reached there at mid noon and manage to catch all the parade and theater show which was great. Plan your meal as earlier as possible so you can avoid the crowd. Stay until the fireworks and you wodon't be disappointed about it.",4
"Discounted tickets available at local travel agents in Hong Kong.Parades are most exciting experiences.Dodon't miss out the fireworks after night parade.The balloon lady was racist and kept us waiting until she served all the local Chinese guests. The ride operators are grumpy and many times forget to repeat the instructions in English.The overall rides are in good. We spent most of the time in Tomorrow Land , Toy Story Land and Adventure Land.Jungle River Cruise around 6.45pm (just before it closes at 7pm) was amazing. The Disneyland hotel guests get 3 passes per room. We had 6 passes for two rooms and did not use all passes. Not long queues for rides average would have been 5minutes, except for new Iron Man ride.",4
"Nice ride options; fireworks and both the parades are must watch. Be ready to expect long queues to snap a pic with Disney characters. When we visited, most of the restaurants were closed for renovation which is surprising as how can they close all of those simultaneously.",4
"Had went to Disney World and Disneyland in Anaheim. Although Disneyland Hong Kong is alot smaller, but its just as magical like the others. I was there with my 4yo and 8yo kids during the weekdays and it was not very crowded. Probably also because it was drizzling, and we're glad that the heavy rainpour happened in the early morning before the park opens. I'm lucky that I did not encounter any bad behaviors from the mainlanders which I read in some of the posts. I would think that 1 day is enough to cover the whole place. But if you are like us who likes to take pictures and autographs from the characters, 2 days will be a comfortable pace so as to cover the rides, shows and parades. The shows are good, make sure to catch them when you are there. We enjoyed ourselves on the ride. The parades were entertaining and the firework was fantastic. Do be mindful that you are not allowed to bring food to Disneyland, but sandwiches are OK. We bought the burger bun at the bus food kiosk outside Disneyland and I simply love it. It was nice and tasty!In all, we enjoyed our visit at Disneyland Hong Kong.",4
The park was not too busy and we were able to ride without too much queuing. Only down side was that we seemed to arrive at character meetings just as they closed. never managed to get the photo with Mickey. Overall what you expect from Disney.,4
"Was visiting Lantau to see the Big Buddha, and then planned to visit Hong Kong Disney in the late afternoon. Having done Hong Kong Disney before I was well aware that it diddon't require a whole day. Disneyland here has really improved since my first visit. I was actually quite impressed with the new additions to the park. It appears that there is plenty of space for expansion so think there will be more to do in time. The only downside to this theme park is that it is rather pricey   especially considering its size and if you were to Ocean Park it's poor value for money.Will more then likely go again and for any Disney fan it's a must.",4
enjoyed a family holiday and its fun for both adults and young. lots of good rides. weather was perfect,4
"I have been to Disneyland in California and Orlando. We were in HK and so decided to bring our kids to the one there. We were pleasantly surprised, becos' on trip advisor there were so many negative comments about the place.Even though it is no where in size compared to the ones in the STATES, it was very nice and compact to walk through especially for kids. My kids are not walkers and hate the heat. So this place was great! We felt that there were sufficient things for them and us to do without being overwhelming like Orlando disney and it 's multiple lands. The productions there were top notched. We watched the Lion King (great puppetry), Mickey and the wondrous book (really amazing stage! must see) and Mickey's Philhar. The most surprising and fun attraction for us was Mystic Manor   another must see. It wasdon't what we expected   it was better! We visited Disney Hk in Spring so the day was cool and becos' it was a weekday, there were no line ups! It was a great trip.",4
"Earlier I thought of giving 5 stars, but I am reducing it to 4 stars after visiting OceanPark. The latter is having more number of thrilling rides than this Disneyland. Overall, you can enjoy and feel better in Disneyland if you are accompanied with your child. The afternoon and evening parade are must to watch.Make sure that you check the park map online and make a rough plan as per your interest of rides so that you can cover them up early in the morning without any rush. Shows     (check latest shows and timings in the website)The Festival of Lion King   must watch show. Timings   12:00 PM, 2:00 PM, 4:30 PM, 6:00 PM     Adventureland     30mins show.Mickey and the Wondrous Book   12:00 PM, 1:15 PM, 3:45 PM, 5:15 PM, 6:30 PM     Fantasyland     28mins showOnly light snacks     such as crackers and cookies, and water, juice are allowed in Disneyland.Ticket booking options: 1. Direct on the spot but depends on the availability. 2. Get online ticket from direct website 3. Get online voucher ticket from Klook (Singapore based website), KKday (Taiwan based website), Yatra (India based website) Timings: 10.30am to 8.45pm",4
"Easily accessible by train from Hong Kong Station Very toddlers friendly We downloaded the mobile app which indicate the waiting time for popular ride Rides like Dumbo , Cinderella, Winnie the Pooh , the small world , train are all toddlers friendly Waiting time average 20 minutes The parade starts at 1915 and last for 25 minutes Followed by fireworks at 2015 There are many F&B outlets too Good dim sum at Plaza Inn on the USA Main Street Priority is given to old man with wheel chair   my father at 92 years of age even rode on Dumbo and Winnie the Pooh This is the most child friendly Disneyland we have been Very enjoyable ",4
"We bought 2 toddlers  1 and 2 year olds to Hong Kong Disneyland and am quite surprised there were plenty for them to do  as in rides. Mainly at fantasyland. I counted there were at least 12 rides that does not have height or age restrictions which is plenty for a toddler. Most of them are also wheelchair friendly. Which by the way, wheelchair people have priority when it comes to queuing up.We went on a Friday and it was literally a pram city. It was quite busy but not packed. Some rides you had to wait for nearly an hour.There are plenty to eat. If you are worried if there is any Chinese food to eat.. there is a restaurant serving Yum cha  plaza inn (on the Main Street on your left before you enter fantasyland).Their app is great and easy to use. And save you a lot of trouble walking back and forth. It also tells you the wait times for the popular rides. Free wifi is available at the park. You will have to sign in every 15mins because that is the max limit their allowed for each time you log in. The park is very clean. The toilets by the end of the day was disgusting unlike a typically clean Hong Kong toilet, most likely due to the mass number of tourist who dodon't know how to use the toilet properly. The easiest and fastest way to get to HK Disneyland is by train from central. ",4
Went with our 4 year old.  He loved it and it was worth the trip.  Spend the whole day and saw maybe half of the park.,4
"Although it's not as good as other disneylands , still there's a lot to enjoy! You can feel happiness everywhere! Using disneyland app helps a lot regarding show times,etc. Firework was worth to wait until 8:30 pm. I diddon't like disney characters that much (especially their dresses). MTR is the most convenient way to get there.Food court needs to improve.Dodon't miss mystic manor , it's a small world , jungle cruise , big grizzly mountain!",4
"Somewhat different from several years ago there are new attractions and they do keep on developing.I just love their fireworks show it's the most impressive part of the whole day. Their carnival parades are impressive, there's one during the afternoon and another just before the late night fireworks show. Recommend seeing both.The music definitely gets stuck in your head, great place for all Disney fans and generally for families with children.",4
"Went to Disneyland with our 3 year old and had a lovely time,while this is not on the scale of Disneyworld Florida its a great way of spending 2 days in Hong kong. This disney is more geared to the younger kids i think our daughter coulddon't go on 1 ride, the longest queue was for dumbo and that was about 20 mins most of the other rides were about 5 mins.",4
"Great day at HK Disneyland. It's a much smaller park than Anaheim but with intense sun and heat, we were grateful to get around most of the park in a day. There's plenty to do and we were there from the minute it opened until close and we missed out on plenty. The parades were awesome, Springtime procession, paint the night and fireworks were all must sees! Be aware, we used a global wallet card and all our credit card transactions were duplicated across multiple currencies and have not been returned two days later still waiting for help on this. Overall park was great and hard to criticize when I love Minnie so much. Be organized though we waited 90 minutes at the start for photos with Minnie and Mickey and got sunburnt in the process. Those of us who have been to other Disney Parks may be disappointed with the more limited merchandise selection. ",4
Lots of fun activities and parade going on . Doesdon't need to wait long for each ride and shows . Best of the experience is the fireworks show with theme .,4
"Went in March, which it was warm but not hot and humid, so it was comfortable in terms of weather. Also, went on Monday to avoid weekenders. There were basically no lines for rides and it wasdon't crowded at all. So, perhaps weekdays could be ideal. We've been to Orlando, CA and Tokyo Disney and I would say Hong Kong is the smallest (not a bad thing!). The hours are shorter as well (ends at 8:30pm or so). So, it's a good one day event and dodon't really need to spend more than a day unless it's too crowded and you cadon't get on all the rides. We got there little after opening time (opened at 10:30am) and it was plenty of time to go through it all. When walking up from the subway station (not sure on bus or taxi but subway was super easy and recommended with the Octopus card, the public subway transfers directly to Disney train tram), we noticed luggage valet area where you can drop off your luggage and pick it up later. I thought this was a nice service if you need to check out of hotel and you got a late flight out. I think it was only $100HK. The rides are mostly similar and or same vs other Disney parks but there's some new unique to Hong Kong. I would say it's more tailored to younger family as the rides are not as scary or hard. Our kids are 6 and 9 and they had a blast. Even Toy Story RC ride was good enough for adults while kids thought it was fun. It's a small world ride is also updated with Disney characters and they did a great job with a classic ride. In all, just keep your expectations in check and you will have fun. ",4
Spent two days there and had a good experience......but we visited paris disney last year so in comparison to that the staff didnt seem to be very up to the standard....though there were some who were really helpful.Like disney paris has the concept of the character autographs which my kids really enjoyed but everytime we asked the staff at HK disney they seemed a lil annoyed. The afternoon and evening parade were both amazing. Overall fun days spent...Disney is magical as always,4
"Good park in Lantau Island. Pretty easy to access by metro. Not so cheap ticket to go inside. If you are looking for only amusement park ride, there is a few good, but not so special place. Parade was great.",4
"I have been here three times in the past 5 years and I observe that the crowd in HK is less than Disneyland Tokyo or even Paris (esp now that Shanghai Disneyland is open, most China tourists go there instead of HK one). The new attractions   Iron Man Experience and Hyperspace Mountain are super cool. Thrill seekers will also love Big Grizzly Mountain. Go for those rides! The queue is not too long (manageable). Food wise  i think Royal Banquet Hall in Fantasyland has the best range of food (international, Jap and grill). Price is around $120 140 per set. If you are planning this as your last day activity before flying off (like we did. Our flight is at 9pm), take a taxi from Disneyland to the airport. Cheaper and faster. Only around HKD120 (including luggages fees) and you need not transfer trains. ",4
"Just spent a weekend there with my 90 year old parents. You can rent wheelchairs at the concierge. Unfortunately, there is only one game 'It's a small world' allowing the wheelchair user to have special privilege   jumping the queue. Since my parents are annual pass gold cardholders, we can have free parking and pay $389 only for the ticket. This special deal will last until July 2017. Better get an annual pass for the seniors, around $488, then you can have all the benefits.",4
"We went on a Monday, there was no line longer than 30 minutes. Compared to the Disney's in the US, it was much smaller, but worth the price. We bought our tickets on the mobile device the hotel provided and saved about $20 total. It's very clean and we really did have a great time as a couple. ",4
I am propably one of the biggest Disneyland fans in the world. Because of that I diddon't have a lot of expectations of Disneyland Hong Kong. We visited it last week. Weather was okey and it was so quiet! Unbelievable. We could do every attraction twice and even had some time left. I loved the Grizzly train and Mystic Mansion. The last one is one of the best attractions I've ever been in. I was disapointment of the Iron Man Experience and the fact that a lot of restaurants where closed.Overall a fun day and a must do for Disney lovers. ,4
"I and family went to Disneyland HK this last Christmas (exactly on 25th Dec). As predicted, the park was full with visiotrs. Thanks God we have booked our ticket online before. This is a very recommended way to avoid the long queue on ticket locket especially during holidays. Just print out the online ticket and redeem your ticket in ticket machines available near the entry gate.",4
"We have been all 6 Disney parks now. This is the 4th best but still fun to go see. You can do the park in 1 2 to 3 4 a day. The park opened at 1030am, but somem of the areas did not open until 11am, so you need to listed and plan accordingly. The grizzley Gulch coaster and the  haunted mansion   not really haunted but really cool   are a must see. Winnie pooh and Buzz were closed so that was a little disappointing. The simulator on Iron Man is a must do as well. The Space Mountain was redone to now have scenery that is like you are in Star Wars jet shooting at the Empire. Best Space Mtn ride of all of them. Its a Small World was even a little better as the scenary is different and includes Disney Princesses in each set, which is fun to find for the kids. Go early as there are multiple line checks to get in. Buy tickets ahead of time as 2 3 of the people that went thru security stopped to get tickets there.",4
"when comparing the castle with the overseas one, the one in HK is  tiny  but the experience is also fun, nice, happy!   Good to see ShellieMay and Duffy here! I love Duffy!!!   Scrumptious foods.  Overall experience is fantastic.",4
"It is a place to be seen, beautiful and congested.Modern yet old, expensive but cheap on some levels.Transportation from the airport is as expected expensive as any big city. We use uber to get around and it was the most cost effective.Mass transit also works well and is reasonable to use.We did the combination of the two.Victoria peak is a.must see at sundown and evening. HK is stunning from there. Hotels are not cheap and rooms are very small by our standards.Food was surprisingly expensive in large restaurants but there are always fast food options!HK is a must see place if only once in your life.",4
"A good day out but thought park was small , even compared to Paris , quite expensive but if you are in Hong Kong with a seven year old you will have to take them as its Disney land , food is cheaper on the park than other disneys we've been to !!!!",4
"Hi guys, I have heard a lot about The Disneyland across the world but decided to visit HK and witness the show there being from India. First let me speak about the attraction and then the reason I chose to visit HK. I would like to specify that the premises is spread wide enough that you cannot cover the complete attraction in 1 day for sure even if you just play two games in one division (there are about 8 9 divisions in the complete attraction). Hence, I suggest that you book your accommodation along with the tickets for the attraction. First time visitors can definitely go ahead. I would like to inform you that you cannot carry any food into Disneyland. Only water from outside is allowed into the park. You have MTR service directly reaching the park from the mainland. You can also reach the park which is close to the Airport by bus and cab. Now coming to the reason for the visit to HK Firstly.... it is one of the tourist destination close to India featuring Disneyland, Second... it is a good tourist destination having lot of attractions near by like Macau and Shenzen. Third .... you get to have edible veg cuisine and a lot of sea food cuisine if you are in HK.",4
This was out first Disneyland experience and enjoyed it even though it is obviously more targetted for families with small children. It had a  feel good  vibe and was a relaxing environment even with crowds,4
"First time visit to any Disney establishment.Being an aged pensioner pleasantly surprised to receive reduced admission fee $1oo HK dollars instead of $600HK.Once inside it is Disney,Disney and more Disney.No matter whats your age it is a visit that has to be done.Plenty to do for families and enough for people of my age group to do without experiencing a cardiac arrest.Great friendly atmosphere and pleasant staff.",4
"Stepping into the world of Disney is always an exciting one. The Disneyland at Hong Kong is no different and in fact you tend to spend less time queuing here than the other Disney parks around the world. Yes it's not the biggest of the Disney parks, but it's great for a day visit or two. We went on the new Iron Man Experience which I diddon't think was all that great, but Toy Story land is fantastic, great design and you feel like a big kid. Make sure you stay for the 'Paint the Night Parade' which is simply Disney at it's best, it's one of the best parade's i've ever seen and I would have made the visit just to see it!",4
We have visited Disneyland first time in life and found ultimate and awesome place for Fun and Entertainment for Adult and kids both .Rides are awesome and best experience .Theme are perfect .Good view and surroundings .Full day fun place in Hongkong !,4
Arrived during the 2nd week of March and had a 2 day admission ticket .There were relatively little crowds during the weekdays and the temperature during this time is cool between 18 to 23 degrees Celsius. The park must visit rides include the iron man experience and for pre schoolers all rides in fantasy land. The picture taking with the various characters would take up most of ur time as crowds magically appear whenever these sessions are on. ,4
"It was my 3rd trip and 2nd trip for my 5 year old. She absolutely loves it! We got the ticket with the dining offer (that offers one combo meal at designated restaurants in the park) and it was value for $.There are new attractions as compared to my last trip like e Iron Man n the toy story.There is even a night parade that is one hour before the fireworks. The fireworks has reinvented itself by having a laser show at the same time!Overall, it was a fun experience for my child!",4
"Great day in the park , easy to get to  On underground , not as big as Orlando  Or Paris but as normal with Disney good , rides seamed not do fast here",4
Been looking forward to my first visit and it diddon't disappoint :) Loved everything we visited. Since I'm weak hearted no adventurous rides for me but still enjoyed the tamer rides and all the sites. Seeing the parades with familiar Disney characters and of course the fireworks show at the end made me tear up with happiness. And I am already old :) really awakened the kid in me,4
"I have been to other Disneylands many times. The Hong Kong Disneyland is very well done as Disney always is. It Is a smaller park with many very good live shows. There are not many big rides such as rollercoasters and fast rides. But overall the park was lovely. My grandson had a great time in Fantasyland, the buzz ride, Toy Story land etc. I would definitely return with small children.",4
"Small Disneyland park, perfect for kids of 3 6 years old. If there are not many queues, you can experience almost all the attractions in one full day. Night parade highly recommended: very involving!",4
"It brought out the child in me. We visited on a week day and found it easily on the MRT (it has its own line and even the train was Disney themed). We were concerned we'd be the only adults there, we weredon't and the majority of people visiting were adults, there were hardly any children which was nice. There's plenty to do to fill up your day. It wasdon't overly busy so we diddon't have to wait long. The only let down was the food which wasdon't very pleasant. On the way out we were given souvenirs for taking part in a survey about our trip and felt our opinions were listened to. I can definitely recommend visiting, even as an adult! ",4
"We visited Hong Kong Disneyland with our 2 year old daughter and loved it. Way smaller then all other Disneyland parks we have visited, but great for small kids and very short waiting lines. Had a great day over here and will definitely visit again when we have the small one along. ",4
"One of the company's parks, it has many attractions similar to other Disney parks. The name, however, boosts the entrance ticket cost to high levels. Nightly fireworks display at 8 pm. Easy access by car or MTR train.",4
"Hong Kong Disneyland is considered small among other Disneyland. The bright side is you will only need a day to conquer all the attractions.Since mainland tourists of China also opted HK for a getaway, this place kinda packed and crowded even in a casual weekday. So I suggest everyone who plans to visit to start as early as you can.Oh the last, the price of meals and snacks here slightly cheaper compare to other Disney parks. ",4
"I went there almost the end of February 2017. Unfortunately, the weather isdon't on my side, it was cloudy and windy (extra windy with Disneyland right near the seacoast). It took me 40 45 minutes by MTR to go to Disneyland (can be shorter or longer depending on what station is near you, mine is Yau Ma Tei station). I arrived around noon on a Friday, not many people yet (becomes crowded around 3 4PM). It is best to take the Disneyland train if you come in the morning so as you can see the whole park and know which you want to go first. For me, I went from right and circle my way around (my last ride being Grizzly ride). Oh, and I bought an online ticket for one day   plus one meal (589 HKD) from selected restaurant (cheaper than buying at the park). During the day, there will be several recognizable Disney mascots (mickey minney; donald d; Elsa; etc) going to different spots to take pictures). For those planning to collect them all, plan well! You can end up waiting 1.5 hours (seems longer with the cold wind) just to take a pic with one mascot. Ask the staff around the park when and where the mascots will be.As for the rides, there are several to choose from, my favs are Grizzly and Star Wars (all coasters!). You can bring a bottle of water in but doesdon't allow food. Eat before entering as the price is quite high.One whole day should be enough to cover most of the rides and activities and parades and fireworks (and by whole day I mean from opening until closing) but two is preferable so as to not get too exhausted (lots of walking!).",4
"Everything you would expect from a Disney theme park. The mark is on the smaller side but everything is new and maintained. The best part is the private train to the park, very easy and accessible.",4
First came here more than 13 yrs ago and it was packed like sardine but this time round it was much more easier to queue for the rides. average queue for the rides was 25 min on a weekday so there was no need to buy express pass. Easily accessible by MTR but distance might be a bit far. Would be best to stay 1 night here if travelling with young kids.,4
"If you are a senior, age 65 or over, you can get admission to Disney Hong Kong for about $10.00 U.S. It is not all for children and teens, and there are many good restaurants also in the complex. The cable ride itself is worth it, and shows all the amusements and theatre's from a bird's eye view. The Theatre itself is worth it also, comes with vibrating seats, mist for rain, wind, so it is a real involved movie theatre. Have fun",4
"Me and my partner spent the day hereWe got there via the MTR which was very easy and they even have a Disney train with micky mouse shaped windows This was my first time to Disney land and I'm 26 years old I still had a great time, obviously had a better time because I dodon't have children to annoy me all day and see all the kid attractionsDefinitely check it out once in your life, prices aredon't as bad as you think there going to be either ",4
enjoyed every moment!!   We have been there to celebrate our kids birthday and he enjoyed every moment. It was a hot day but we like it and best part of the parade.  Dodon't miss it.,4
If you wanna visit Disneyland I would suggest you spend at least one day here. I and my friend spent a day and we still coulddon't finish all the attractions. The queue to take a picture with Mickey and Minnie is very long. Also some attractions like star war and iron man. You can download their apps to see the waiting hour and timing. The show for night parade is at 7 pm. It's really a great show.. Also firework at 8pm.,4
You'll become a kid again when visiting Disneyland. There's a train with metro connection. If you arrive by train you'll be mesmerised. The only issue are the extremely long queues for the rides,4
"This place is perfect for both elderly and kids.. We thoroughly enjoyed a day out, a perfect outing, it is not that big and we covered almost all attractions. It is recommended to visit in weekdays as there are long queues during weekend and you lose lots of time in the queue.",4
"Animated colour vision life !!!! Once in a lifetime, never go to Disney' Universes   you wasting your time in your life. Trumbling heart parade. Tooooooooooooo crowds. Kids must plan earlier to be in the front of the line with many surprises !!!!!Smile from hearts for all !!!",4
One of the famous activities in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Disneyland was small place that you can walk around easily but full of the attractions. Its very suitable for kids.,4
"super enjoy but lines will take up much of your energy and time  do not miss the shows, the parades and the fireworks",4
This is one of the famous attraction in HK. I think it is worth to visit especially if you have children or if you are Disney fans. It was quite relaxing and great for photos taking.,4
Hong Kong Disneyland is worth going to if you are going to be in Hong Kong for an extended trip and you are with your family. Make sure you check out which rides will be closed when planning your visit! A ton of (much needed) renovations are happening.,4
"Very enjoyable day at Hong Kong Disney, it cost aprrox   65 for the one day pass, the fireworks were excellent at the end of the day, we did get around the whole park in a day which indicates it is quite small, but all in all well worth it!!",4
"great to see, lots of walking and fun things to see.  the parade was exciting . rides thrilling. good food choices",4
Great place for children. Food expensive . Crowded during holiday season Chinese New Year . Must try if in Hong Kong,4
"Disneyland, who doesdon't love Disneyland. Hong Kong Disneyland has 7 big part of area, tens of shows and parades. So you need at least half day to visit this amusement park (I said at least). Tips: buy ticket in your hotel to get cheaper price and ticket box's queuing line in Disneyland.",4
Not just kids that enjoy this place but also adults where rides are also for adults.  It brings out the kinds in us.,4
"Took the meal ticket offer. Smaller park, less people, and managed to queue for quite a few rides. Might return someday.",4
Hong Kong Disneyland is relatively small compared to the other Disneylands. But I think it is still very entertaining except the service level of the staff could be more cheerful.,4
"Disneyland is always a fun place to visit. Be prepared to spend your time and money there. The queues can be daunting for some of the attractions. You need to plan your visit properly in order to enjoy the whole park. Food and drinks is expensive inside. To get here, you need to take the MTR to sunny Bay Station and then change to the Disney Line. You will be amused by the design of the train.",4
Smaller compared to Tokyo Disneyland but still fantastic! Went there on a weekday so lesser lines. Check first showtimes before lining up for the rides; shows are great. Dodon't forget to try Space Mountain and the Rides in Toy Story land.,4
We can walk from end to end within 15 minutes. The rides are about the same as any Disneyland but this park is small compared to the others in the US. Its still a nice day out for the little kids.,4
"It's definitely a must visit once in your life....this one is definitely not a large one....maybe one of the smaller ones but then that doesdon't take away much. It has almost all the makings of a perfectly fun day for kids and if kids are happy then so wil the parents be. In my case, I was happy that the daughter was quite happy and excited but what was even more surprising in retrospect was that my wife remembered it very fondly and maybe even enjoyed it even more than my daughter, and hence the title.The rides are all included in the price, and there are quite a few of them all good for the kids for sure and very few that adults may have fun too! It is advisable that you carry your own food as it's expensive inside the park. Also, carry umbrellas and be ready for a long and tiring day as it's quite expansive. There's the option of priority pass that you can choose on select slides which is really good and must be explored.",4
"by no means cheap, but great entertainment for the young and young at heart. Do not bother to eat the crappy fast food in the park it is dismal, but the hotel food was very good. Will go again",4
Been to almost all Disneyland Parks in the world so expecting almost the same experience as the other parks. HK Disneyland has an Asian feel to it though. We waited for the Disney character parade and the fireworks at night.. didnt disappoint.,4
"Perfect family day out. For thrill seekers this is not the park for you as the more adventurous rides are still quite tame. It's not a huge park, which makes it easy to navigate. The shows and parades are everything you expect of Disney and check you map for the locations of characters for the memorable photograph.Food here is typically overpriced and catered to local tastes.",4
"Decided to take a trip to Hong Kong before Chinese New Year and took the kids to HK Disney. Kind of odd because we live about 10 minutes away from the original Disney in Anaheim. First impression, it felt like Disneyland. The decorations, layout, feel and employees all made it feel like Disney. The main difference was the crowd. We arrived early so diddon't have to fight as much of a crowd. We took the boys on a few rides early, and was even able to get on the new Iron Man ride with minimal wait. It felt like there were more rides suited for young kids and less extreme rides, but since we went with younger kids, it was fun. We watched a few shows and felt that the shows were actually better in HK Disney than the Anaheim one. The performance wasdon't necessarily better, but the overall compilation was better. Seeing that the tickets were cheaper than the US Disney and they had more food selections, the overall experience was not disappointing. Although, I did have to tell some guy off for not being able to stand in line correctly, and the best part was his lame excuse. But that diddon't ruin our family time. ",4
"Well, it's Disney land ! Great place with lots and lots of activities for kids and adults.  But take care of your belongings, theft is quite common. I really doubt if there's any security monitoring like CCTV ,etc.   So please be careful with your belongings!!",4
"As an expat   I have visited HK Disneyland three times over the years since it opened and continue to enjoy it, even now my kids are mid to late teens we all like a day there   but as with all Disney theme parks   they are busy and you seem to spend most of the time in long waiting lines   the rides are clean, fun and well managed   food halls are ok, nothing special, but do the job   for a family staying in Kowloon (as the Disney hotels are expensive and always booked) then its cheap to get a taxi to the park   if just one or two people, then take the express train there   entry tickets are not cheap, as none of the large amusement parts are, but still a must to do   get a nice HK Disneyland t shirt or cup.",4
We arrived shortly after the opening and the first thing we did when we entered the park was fall in line for a picture with Mickey and Minnie of course! We went there on a weekday so it was not that crowded but the waiting time went as high as 40min. For a picture with Mickey and Minnie we had to wait in line for ~40min. The popular rides also had 30 40min waiting time. One day wodon't be enough so I recommend getting the 2 day ticket.,4
"So, it is a very small Disney and people tell you that it can be accomplished in 4 5 hours. That could be true if you did not have to spend an hours in line for Dumbo ride, or to take pictures with the characters. I think if you get there first thing in the morning, before the gates open, it would probably allow you to do more. After 1PM, there is a long line for everything during weekends, or Chinese New Year. We got there at noon, and by then, the crowds were there. Also, despite how amazingly orderly everything in Hong Kong can be, one thing that the locals (and maybe mainland China visitors) are chaotic about is cutting in lines and just generally shoving their way around. It can get quite annoying. Many people spend a lot of time in the shops, it seems. What a great business to charge a huge entrance fee and then make the easiest place be the shops, where you spend even more. The Fireworks are really nice as advertised. Take the MTR to and from, but be prepared for huge crowds and being sandwiched in the train. It is like taking the public transportation after a sports even lets out.",4
"We arrived an hour before opening and were one of the first ones in the gate. We went on most rides straight away without any waiting. By midday most rides had in between 20 to 50 minute wait times. I think it was also in our favour that we went on a Thursday and not the weekend. This is a small Disneyland compared to the ones in the U.S and would be perfect to take young children. We walked the park 3 times around and went on most rides as well as having lunch and we left at 4pm. Getting to Disneyland was very easy by the mtr. We caught the train from Jordan to Lai king, Lai king to sunny bay then the Disneyland train.",4
Fun attractions and for the young at heart. Mickey mouse train theme was a nice touch. Special train station for Disneyland goers,4
"We actually stayed at the Disneyland hotel the 3 days we went into the park. they have a good transportation system to the park, the only downside is that it's a long walk to the entrance. I would suggest that they have additional transportation from the transportation hub to the gates, even if they charge. After all, there is nothing free at Disney.The staff greeting you are very friendly and courteous, despite the fact that they have to deal with unruly mainlander crowds.Surprisingly, almost all the staff had pin lanyards to trade pins with, which mainlanders dodon't know about yet, so bring pins to trade. I was told by a friend that it is only because it was CNY and they had to all show the pins due to higher ranking bosses making sure that they looked good during this Festive season.The parades are well organized and professional. access to characters can test your patience, as some. lineups, specially for Mickey and Minnie were running a couple of hours long. Best to check for times with their staff and get there early.The restaurants were many but be prepared to pay lots for little food as the norm at Disney parks.The stores were full of merchandise and no shortage of buyers.Their Ironman experience was new, but just a conversion of the Star Wars experience at other parks.They are opening a 3rd hotel, so no doubt the park will get much busier. A note if you are going around CNY, go on the first day of CNY. no crowds at all",4
"I just love the place ! It is a small place compare to the one in Japan or US but that what I love about it. This place tough suitable mostly for kids anyway adults can also enjoy some excitments. I love the theathers, parks, small ridings as well as water cruising. Tarzan tree house is good, it provide views from the top over the rivers and parks. Grizzly mine was exciting and thrill (at least for me). Your kids probably will LOOOVE the toy story sections. Simba theather performance is truly not too miss. Overall, I enjoy my moments here, excitement without being overly exhousted :)",4
"Im a big fan of Disney.As with any theme park, I would recommend going as early as possible to avoid the longer queues later in the day.I have been a couple of times and I still find it entertaining.My only issue with the Hong Kong Disneyland, if any, is the availability of the characters and a lack of certain movie merchandise.There are so many Disney movies, yet the number of character encounters are limited.Also, between my first and last visit, under 1 year apart, they dodon't seem to have restocked on Lion King merchandise.I guess these aredon't major issues, as I've said, I love it and I intend to return.I recommend the photopass, at just under 500HKD you have every photo you have taken on your day at Disneyland in digital format, no need to choose which to print.",4
Try to go early if you intend to snap some photo with Disney characters. And you can have plenty of time to take all the ride.,4
"We enjoyed Disneyland Hong Kong. It is a fairly small park, but easy to navigate through in just a day, no need for multiple days. T it is easy to get to using the MRT. Disney line is clearly marked in all the stations (the pink line), and the train is very Disney oriented. It had memorabilia and Mickey hand holds   lots of fun for the kids to see. The rides were fun. Fast passes are only available for three rides: Marvel Experience, Hyperspace Tours, and The Winnie the Pooh ride. If you dodon't like  Asian inspired American Food , bring your own lunch. The Lion King show was awesome, but the crowd management is awful   only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five. They line you up to put you in groups, then it is a mad dash to grab a seat. Felt like Walmart on Black Friday. Get there early to be in the front to avoid the pushing and shoving. It needs to be more organized, but again, the show was great. Lines weredon't too bad, and we went on Chinese New Year. They do a good job of letting you know what's happening around the park. Most employers speak English enough to help if needed. Prices for souvenirs and merchandise is comparable to US parks. They will let you pay with either USD or HKD, your receipt shows you both prices. Just be aware they are offering a lower conversion fee ( .4% I think). They do offer many  freebies  and deals with purchase that seemed to be a good deal. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at Disneyland Hong Kong. ",4
"So much fun   it's Disneyland, just a smaller version. If you've never been to any other Disneyland park you will likely be in awe and amazement of all the fun and wonder... But if you have been to another Disneyland park before, you wodon't love it as much. Dodon't get me wrong   it's awesome...but it's a lot smaller than most other Disneyland parks. The scenery is beautiful (there's mountainous hills behind the park which offer a really nice backdrop), and it does have some of the standard Disneyland rides (Space Mountain, the Tea Cups, It's A Small World). But it's not really a full day thing, especially if you're an adult. Having said that   it's still Disneyland! :) ",4
"This theme park is comparably small with other countries'. But there were not a lot tourists, so diddon't wait for too long for each game.",4
"Disneyland is indeed the happiest place on Earth. It is located at Lantau Island, Outlying Islands. Disneyland is truly The Happiest Place on Earth. It is where our childhood princes, princesses and other fairy tale creatures come to life.",4
"This being one of the smallest Disney resorts, it was definitely well managed and pricey. Though it was chilly we had the best weather that day and the place looked magical :) The ticketing and the entrance was hassle free and faster than expected. We diddon't like much of the foods available at the resort as it was really bland and tasteless. There was a lot of activities to choose from and thought the rides were short it was ok as the wait for the rides were not long either. We got to see the Flights of Fantasy from the front row and it was pretty cool. Recommend waiting for the night light show. Definitely worth a visit if you are in HK :)",4
We enjoyed the experience of Disneyland Hong Kong but found it catered more to our 5 year old more than our teenagers. It seems to be more suited for younger children rather than EuroDisney which we found better for older kids and adults. Definitely worth checking out if you have a day to spare and havedon't been to Disneyland before. Fireworks when the park closes were lovely but packed and I'd suggest if you want to buy things from the stores to do it earlier in the day as it's crowded and crazy at the end!,4
Definitely worth a visit and is easily accessible via the MTR. If you have visited any of the other Disney parks then you will probably find this one a little small. When we visited in January the park was nice and quiet. Most of the queue times were around 15 mins. ,4
"Lots of fun but a good deal of the day is spent in lines, lines for the rides, lines for the shows even lines for the souvenirs, there are a reasonable number of attractions but it's not as big as some of the American parks. Our brochure said allow around 3 and a half hours, we were there for six and probably missed about 30% of the park due to the waiting around and that was on a Wednesday & not during the holidays, while I'm happy we went I woulddon't go again. ",4
"Being a big Disney lover, I absolutely loved the theme park! Compared to the others I've been to (Florida and Paris) it's not quite in the same league, but it's still worth a visit if you like rides and the whole Disney experience... The lines for the rides weredon't too long, but then we were there during term time and in the week! The food in the park varied and probably there was something for everyone !Will definitely go back in the future! ",4
"Enjoyable couple of days in January Weather was comfortable Longest wait time for rides was around 30 minutes Street parades and fireworks worth watching, very entertaining Plenty of merchandise to buy Only downside, not all attractions open and some food carts and restaurants closedBut above all, a very enjoyable time for young and old",4
"Although small in comparison to its American cousins, it does epitomise everything Disney. You wodon't find Mickey shaped pretzels but all the characters are there. Go in winter, you have shorter wait times and the weather is great. Just be aware that the park closes early with fireworks between 7.30 and 8.30 pm.",4
Disney land always makes you feel the younger version of yourself to see all the famous characters you had seen in fairy world and movies. Must visit for all ages and njoy the old nostalgic time. Its worth and good time spend.,4
"We caught the MTR for approx 40 hkd return, changed a few times but never waited more than a few minutes for a train.Park is fun, not many roaming characters but parade at 3 pm covered that. Reasonable queue for Mickey Mouse photos and merchandise expensive and food just ok. Rides are all there and cater for younger kids well. Transformers, toy story, space mountain all great without really long queues. Not really warm so dress warmer than other legs of the cruise",4
"Personally, one full day is enough to cover the whole park (provided you dont have kids I suppose). Though I was abit disappointed with the size of the park, overall it is a fun experience. I recommend to stay until the evening for the parade and fireworks.For those who do not have the time to cover everything, i recommend:1) Festival of the lion king2) Big grizzly mountain mine cars3) Mystic Manor4) Space Mountain5) that new Iron man simulation ride (forgot the name haha)I also recommend visiting during weekdays to avoid crowd. Have fun!",4
"An exciting place to be with 2 teenagers. My husband and I enjoyed being 'kids' again. Although we spent the whole day there but diddon't get to go on all the rides as we did not have enough time! The shows are fabulous which should not be missed! We were disappointed that the second parade had to be cancelled due to the weather but were lucky enough fireworks for the finale was not. My only 3 negative comments about this place that some staff dodon't look happy (remember that is this should be the happiest place on earth), the queues to the show were not well organise (everybody was pressed up to each other and when the doors open there was a frantic rush) and announcements in English were so difficult to understand! Nevertheless, overall it was a wonderful family trip!",4
"My wife and I visited this park with our 21 month old daughter and had a great time. The lines were short (no more than 15 20 min) and the park was not crowded. We loved the character meet and greets because there was a short line so we were able to do many of them. We stayed for 2 days but could have done everything in 1 day.Only con is most of the park closes an hour before fireworks. For us, that meant the rides we planned to do were closed at 7 instead of 8. This was not communicated well to us but there were signs and warnings (that we did not see on the guide map). ",4
"We had 2 young kids under 5 with us. Queues were long but moved relatively quickly considering the length of them! Staff were friendly & efficient. As the gates opened people sprinted for the most popular rides, I would say head (fast!) to the ride you MOST want to do as the queues got longer as the day progressed, the first 2 rides we did we didnt have to wait for than 3 minutes to get on but when we got to the more popular rides we waited 30  minutes. Food was relatively good, no long waits. The shows were a great way to get away from the swarming crowds & hot weather. We spent 2 days going through, which I would recommend due to the crowds & being able to get your moneys worth on the rides. Plenty for the younger kids to do see. If staying at the Disneyland hotel, be sure to be outside waiting for the complimentary bus early as the crowds for that were incredible!",4
Disneyland is fun anytime you go. Its even better this time. They have now Iron man experience center and strak expo for iron man lovers. Micky's magic show is a must watch its a 3D show with water n wind being real. The train is again a must go as it gives a full round of the Disneyland. Only problem is food choice is very limited n is very very expensive. Remember to carry ur water bottle as its 6 times the price inside. Shopping is fun. N guys there is this locker service inside which is very safe n convenient just in case you have extra stuff. We had our transfers booked but we took the MTR(metro train) its was very fast n comfortable. Have fun guys be a child again!!!!,4
"We went there on a Saturday and was half expecting some huge crowds but surprisingly it was manageable. The queues for the rides were within 30 mins and some are just 10 mins. Overall still a very magical place even for the adults.We stayed for the night light up parade and the kids enjoyed themselves. Baby care room was clean, neat and well equipped. I expressed milk there in the nursing room, warmed up the milk with the bottle warmer, used the high chair while I was warming the milk and fed my baby there too. Men are allowed in the baby care room, outside the nursing room. Got a little crowded when the dads, moms and some with grandmas when I was feeding my baby her milk. But still a very comfortable and pleasant place.Do download the app before you go to Disneyland, preferably in your own country. I downloaded mine before the trip and my hubby only did when he got there but had problems with downloading. The app is useful and tells you the waiting time of each ride on the map. As well as the show timings.",4
Splendid experience to HK Disneyland with 3 nights stay at Disney Hollywood Hotel that have awesome food,4
"Disneyland a fun place to stay, well kept, lots of activities and always a fun place to be with kids of all ages.",4
"Magic place for families with kids to relax and unwind , commercial food and some good rides The lines are long so be patient , also look for some exciting Adult rides at the back of the theme park which have quicker lines as everyone gets stuck in the front of the theme park Hire a push car for kids ... hydrate and explore   a good taste of the real Disney World in Orlando Vivashal Singh Auckland NZ ",4
"Good theme park for kids and adults of all ages. Plenty of rides to choose from.We stayed in Disney Hollywood Hotel which has a free shuttle bus to the Disneyland Park itself. We went after new year on weekday and the average waiting time are 20 30 minutes, probably the new Shanghai branch lured people out of HK branch, plus in Asia most schools started around the 3rd Jan. The hotel itself is designed in old theme Hollywood Jazz era of 40s 50s?Weird, the hotel does not have any room service so we had to go down to one of the restaurants. Given the location is a bit way out nowhere it wasdon't easy to get out and about unless you took taxi, or the shuttle bus to MTR station, and another train ride into town.",4
"Christmas Day at Disney was a first and wonderful experience. Not as big as other Disney parks I've been to, but still big enough with all the fun and excitement. Tarzan' adventure island and the professor adventures were thrilling. The parade was amazing and a great way to end the day.",4
"All the fun you expect from Disney Land with less crowds if you pick your day well. We visited in December on a tuesday and the park was really fun. No real lines for rides. Great weather so we had so much fun. Go independantly, no need for special tickets. No fast track tickets available here.",4
We were here in early January after the public holidays so it wasdon't crowded. Most rides were less than 20 mins wait. It's so small. It takes no times to walk from one end to the other. It was disappointed when the classic It's Small World was shut down for maintenance. Food is horrible here. Saw visitors packed their own lunch and now I understood why. ,4
"Lovely weather for a day out at Hong Kong Disney ( not a cloud in the sky for the fireworks) and not at all busy ,such that no need to use Fast pass on the few rides where it was in use   what a difference from Tokyo Disney ! Good selection of rides and also other attractions but everything easily covered and we did not arrive until lunchtime. Food also very good. I had an excellent lamb curry at Mystic Point . Also very easy access by MTR from Central and at a bargain price ( HK $ 54 return fare ) . Well worth a visit all considered . ",4
"This is HK Disneyland we're talking about and not much to see and play for a thrill seeker. Better go there in the afternoon and wait until the fireworks flare the sky at 6 or 8 pm.But still too many visitors make you have to queue more than half hour to its top attractions.Some of quite amazing rides are space mountain, jungle river cruise and mystic manor.Enjoy the sparkling surrounding and its quite fascinating decoration during festive Christmas and New Year.",4
"This is great especially for young people and children, the special effects are great and very amusing. It is worth the trip! Using several lines of MTR, we finally get there. Please rise up earlier to get all the entertainments, dodon't be late out of bed in the morning.",4
"Great ! A wide variety of rides made available for children from preschoolers to primary schoolers. fireworks at 8.00pm every night. We went there thrice from opening to closing and both my children love it very much! Once awhile there were tourists who cut queue, but overall it was a good experience.",4
"We went to Disneyland on Christmas Day and it was not overly busy when we arrived, which was great. We watched the afternoon and the night parade which was fantastic but people were so so pushy. We had a 2 yr old with us and nobody even cared about pushing you around with her in your arms. The lines all had reasonable wait times, and there was so much to see and do  I'm not even sure we saw it all. Our 13 yr old boy had the best time. And there was lots for our little one to do. She LOVED it's a small world... And so did us adults secretly ;) Food was very limited and very average  that is why they lost a star! ",4
"I visited Hong Honk Disney on New Years Eve so it was packed to say the lest. Even so the place was spotless and most things were running smoothly. You dodon't get the same levels of enthusiasm from the staff as you do in Orlando so that dims it down a bit. Its a small park so you can get round it in a day no problem. But if you've small kids its a must do while your here, my daughter loved it.",4
"Visited end of December with my 7 5 and 4 year olds. They loved it. Very appropriate for their age however you have to be organized as the shows and character  meet and greets  have strict times. It is a good idea to download the app which is live and gives tells you waiting times at the different rides. The Lion King show was nice, the Parade at 4pm was fabulous.I diddon't think we would last 3 hours there but we were there from 10am to 7pm . The food is basic but we diddon't go there for food so no biggy. And signage was poor. But the app was very helpful ",4
"I came again to this park after 7 years. A lot of modernization they did and it is a job well done. The apps and some shows with laser works are excellent.I bought two day tickets which have almost the same price like the one day. Good treat for Disney fans.Queue between 2 6pm is (too) long, so come early before 12 for the best experience.They also provide new halal restaurant and a decent prayer room for moslem visitor. Great service overall.",4
"Everybody's magical place...fun exciting and great for all ages. We went around ten am and the park just opened so the queues were not that long but the lines get crowded by lunchtime. I suggest you get on the disney railroad and start from the attractions from a far so the lines are still not that long since most of the people are on the nearby attractions, then do the shows and the photographs with the characters later. Parade is at 330 and is also fun to watch and the fireworks. ",4
"Easily accessible. Queues move along quite quickly at the entrance. Queues for the rides are crazy ridiculous, especially if you have little ones who cannot stay focused for such long periods. Disappointed that only Mickey made an appearance, and not even for photo opps. just a short skit at the front of the castle with the brass band. ",4
"Last year we visited Disneyworld in Florida with our 8 year old in June and its huge offering would have needed a full week to enjoy. This time our visit to Hong Kong Disneyland over Christmas was a lot more relaxed. For one thing the Park is far smaller, more compact and less crowds and lining up. Also the weather was perfect, whilst winter, it was a mild 21 degrees most days. I woulddon't recommend going in June which in Hong Kong (like Florida) is just stifling hot and humid.Disneyworld is easily accessible by MTR from Hong Kong central. After two days we had been on most rides. Thankfully the new new Ironman ride had a soft opening and it was great, incorporating the Hong Kong skyline into the ride with great effect. The other rides were good and our 8 year old had a great time. There is a wild Star Wars roller coaster ride as well but not much else of Star Wars other than the Jedi Training academy and a lot of merchandise. The evening fire works also were fun.The great thing is for an Australian, Hong Kong is only 9 hours flight away and in Aussie time zones compared to the US with both Anaheim and Orlando big flights for kids.We will now only go back to Disney once the new Star Wars worlds are open in the US, that will be worth travelling for!!",4
"One of the smaller Disneylands out there, but has everything you need for you and your family to have a great time. Everything is bilingual (Cantonese and English), friendly staff. We went during the week, so the lines were shortly, only had to wait 20 30 minutes per ride, at most.The Star Wars additions in Tomorrowland were outstanding. A must see. The Ironman experience is a motion theater, not bad for a 10 minute way, may be a bit of a disappointment for an hour or more wait.Great holiday parade at the end with an outstanding fireworks display.Easy to get to with the MTRs.Would definitely go back.",4
"Disneyland was the main reason for our hong kong tour. We had a fun time. It was weird hearing the characters speak in Chinese but you will eventually get use to it. I love the star wars area :)It's great place for pictures. But please take note they strictly prohibit the use of selfie stick. This is my dream place for a pre wedding pictorial.One day is not enough to enjoy the place. No long lines, only 5minute wait with all the rides and attraction. Explore first! Dodon't shop at the first two hours of your stay in Disneyland.It is expensive, we expected that so we wanted good service. Maybe it's the culture thing but the staff could be more polite. It looked like it hurts when they smile. It's better to download the app before visiting the place than go find help in the information area. People there were useless and rude.Bring a big bottle of water, because it is expensive!",4
It is a great day out with your family!They certainly do know how to make it magical... but this park can be done in a day (from about 10am ~ 9pm). I have visited Orlando and California Disneyland. This park is not as magical as mentioned above but still a great day of fun for a 9 year old boy.We did not line up for characters or fantasy world.... so if you would like to you do need to plan for more time.Have a magical day peeps!,4
"Despite being the smallest of all Disneyland, the park is very well planned. My 11 year old son thoroughly enjoyed.  A day package is good enough. Not to miss Tarzan's tree house and the Grizzly Gulch.",4
"Even though the HK Disneyland is the smallest of all Disneyland, it is still a Disneyland. From the perspective of most children, there is no comparison with other Disneyland. Hence the small scale is no issue.Children will enjoy the rides and the attractions. My only wish is that more costumed characters may appear more frequently to allow more photo taking opportunities.",4
"Our third visit to Hong Kong Disneyland, probably our last visit as the kid had out grown most rides and not much of exciting, adrenal pumping rides attracting them further.Smallest among other Disneyland that we had been, we still enjoyed seeing the parade and the fireworks. Shopping for souvenirs are always a must in any Disneyland and fascinating in seeing and choosing as seems all are what you want ",4
"Although it's the smallest Disneyland park in the world, it's also the only one that has tropical surroundings, which is cool. The attractions that i definatelly recommend are Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain and Hyperspace Mountain, also a nice show with 4D movie   Mickey's Philarmagic.Not to be missed here, in my oppinion, are also the fireworks at the castle, the  Paint the night  parade and during the winter holidays, the Christmas tree lighting show.",4
"Not many people would go visit this Hong Kong Disney now, probably mainly because of the drop in mainland china tourists, for the opening of the shanghai one, or simply currency reasons etc. Favourable to anyone who'd like to try out a less crowded version of the Park. Have what it advertised of cause. Expect what you would expect, just less crowded. ",4
I took Disneyland Themed train from Sunny bay MTR and reached Disneyland station.. its very easy and comfortable fast ...although i dint visit inside i just walked up to the entrance and took some snaps around..as i was not much interested since i ve visited Universal studios in Singapore earlier.. The ticket is bit expensive and kids & adults can really enjoy it i hope.. ,4
Disneyland is a good place to visit in Hong Kong specifically if you have kids along with you. Even adults would have a good time here as there are lots of rides which even adults can enjoy.,4
"Special day out for my 9 year old daughter The park is very impressive and certainly worth a visit.I would recommend a visit outside of holiday periods as it seemed that most of Hong Kong was also visiting on the same day.It was extremely busy, which is a reflection on how good the park is.",4
"We went there early in the morning, we took a taxi instead of MTR which costed us a bit more. At the entrance they check all bags, and we purchased two tickets and went in, it is not very big, small a bit, wear comfortable shoes, it is mostly more fun for younger children, still interesting for adults. There were a lot of people from China and a few from Hong Kong, some from the States, and Europe. The people from China, kept cutting the lines, a few times I had to say,  Hello, do you not see us standing here? , Another place we were waiting to see a show, and there wasdon't any indication of where line started and ended just all people standing everywhere which was really horrible. All the Chinese pushed it was a bit crazy, and foreigners looks at each other like Oh My Gosh and we were all laughing even though we dodon't know each other. I would not recommend to go during summer, too hot. Choose a cooler season. Wear sun screen if you go during summer, might burn a bit. Food there was delicious, we had a few coffees to cool us off, we went during beginning of May. It is different than the one in USA, or China. Best to go there not during Chinese holidays otherwise, too many people and bad behaviours. You can buy the food there, it is not crazy high prices, and have water since you will be standing in lines to get in. We finished late and we tried to get a taxi, was not simple, we diddon't know which taxi's to take and etc, so we asked and people were helpful. Outside the DisneyLand there is a fountain, and a nice picture location. Enjoy DisneyLand",4
"The kids and I were glad to see some Star Wars attractions and rides at Tomorrowland and slowly taking over it, but also relieved that Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters is still around. We enjoyed blasting away at the Zurg that we had to take the ride twice! Hyperspace mountain which has you in a X Wing evading Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters was just too thrilling   it's twists and turns, and sudden drops and stops are not for the faint hearted! A crowd favorite is the Slinky Dog Spin   we managed to try it this time, but not in our previous 2 visits to the park as the kids were younger then and did not have the patience nor the stamina for the 30 minute (at least) queue! For the Christmas festive period, there was a Christmas tree light up and fireworks in the evening as well!",4
"This is my first time in disneyland and I am really happy. Most of the things in disneyland is mostly want to attract kids so mostly are for kids but for a 19yr old me, I really do love it. The most unhappy thing of this trip to disneyland is where before you enter, they will need to check ur bags. The girl call me to throw the fried rice i had in my bag away because I cannot bring in. My mum is a vegetarian and disneyland doesnt have vegetarian food so the fried rice i bring is in case she is hungry but she call me to throw. At last I throw but I am still mad at her for making me throwing it. ",4
"Yes, its Disney! Its 5 Star and the staff are super proffesionals! Everything works, parade is great, Attractions are fantastic, but... the line to every ride was about 60 min.And it is NOT cheap inside. If you go in the morning, have big breakfast before, or eat lunch before going there.",4
We loved visiting Disneyland! I went there with my partner and it was the first time for both of us to visit any Disneyland and we really enjoyed all the rides and seeing all the characters walking around. We stayed there all day and really enjoyed the firework show on the night! ,4
"Disneyland  always  cheering place  for  the  kids  to  adults.  May  not  complete  in  one  day  but  must  see  evening  parade,  fireworks  and  other  colourful  photo  session.  There  is  specially  one  MTR  station  right  after  the  main  gate.",4
Great theme park though small. Park is still maintained in good condition. Stark Iron Man attraction in Tomorrowland due to open in Jan 2017. Universal Studios Transformers ride is much better than Iron Man ride. More realistic and effects. Some attractions are conducted in Cantonese. Need to check the timing schedules for English sessions. Lion King and Mickey's Wonderous Book shows are good and the theatres get filled rather quickly.Hope to see more attractions added soon to justify the increase in park ticket prices.,4
"My 2nd visit to HK Disneyland.  Too bad, Iron man attraction only available from Jan' 2017..  Must try Starwars attraction.. but not suitable for young kids & adults with special conditions.",4
"My son love this place so much.. he is first coaster ride is Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, and he love it.. and another cool ride is space mountain.. will comeback here again soon.",4
"Disneyland HK is quite small compare to other countries. But most of the popular rides are present. Kids will definitely enjoy here but wer all adult, wer looking for a thrilling ride. But the kids inside us, are so excited and happy to see the parade and fireworks display. And the giant christmas tree in the middle. Nothing beats the memory of our childhood upon seeing those cute characters again. ",4
"Bought the 2 day fun pass at a discounted price from the HK Disneyland site.Went early in the morning, at opening hours, straight through to Tomorrowland and collected passes for children to appear on the stage show  Trail of the Jedi temple  which is only for children aged 6 12. They have limited slots each day and are distributed from the start of each day. Very popular among children who are 6 10. Instructions are given in Cantonese, Chinese and English, helpful for children, entertaining for parents.",4
definitely a place to visit when you are in Hong Kong! Lots of fun ride. However most of the rides are for kids or not so thrilling,4
Disney land was a good size and easy to get around. One day was plenty i felt. Yes there are queues but I had read the reviews and was mentally prepared! We had a sunny day in winter so took to the shade around midday. Diddon't get to see much of tomorrow land as seemed crowded and I had a 4 and 7 year old. We enjoyed the 3d show and lion king the best. Parade was fun at 330 but diddon't stay for evening as we had been there since opening and felt content and tired! ,4
"Make sure you spend a whole day in Disneyland. Dodon't forget to watch their fireworks at the end. Disney had the best fireworks show. If you want to had dinner   lunch, you can try one of Maxim's Restaurant there. They had a yummy beef brisket menu.",4
"Once again this park is magical. It's Disney so it's good right? The ride times are generally around 10 45 minutes on weekdays and 35 65 minutes on weekends or public holidays. Hong Kong Disneyland is smaller than most parks, but it is still super fun. Dodon't forget to ask the cast members for stickers and ride everything in toy story land, Grizzly Gulch, and Mystic Manor since these are exclusive to Hong Kong Disneyland. Also, Iron Man Experience opens January 2017, I look forward to riding it!",4
"We had a great day at Disneyland. Wasdon't very busy when we visited, minimal wait for rides. Park was very clean and well maintained. Merchandise was well priced, not overly expensive. Main street parade was great. Definately worth a visit if your in Hong Kong :) ",4
This was our 2nd visit to a Disneyland (1st being Paris). In comparison this was more focused towards a younger audience as a lot of the rides were gentler.It was super easy to get there taking the Tung Chung line to Sunny Bay and then changing onto the Disneyland Resort line.We arrived around 11am on Thursday (15th Dec) and overall the park was reasonably quiet (longest wait time was around 40mins with on average we waited about 20mins per ride).The best ride was the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars followed by the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters. Everything else was pretty average.We missed the parade but highly recommend the Lion King theatre   this in itself is worth the park ticket,4
Been to Anaheim and Paris Disneyland but I do enjoy HK Disneyland though it is smaller. We have two young kids under seven so we diddon't do many rides but being in DL aidon't about rushing to go on rides either  it's the entire immersive experience of being in a make believe space and suspending your disbelief (and paying $30 for a cap!)We love the toy story land and the Disneylanders who made us feel very welcomed. And the 7.30pm parade at Main Street USA and the 8.30pm fireworks... and the weather was so great at 13 18c. It wasdon't very crowded perhaps cos many of the mainland Chinese have flocked to the one in Shanghai.,4
"One day visit is ok for me esp my kids are all grown up they diddon't take all the rides but i find the parade very nice. You must ride the Grizzly Gulch, it is the most exciting ride esp if you are looking for very fast and roller coaster ride but not extreme!",4
"The Parade in the afternoon and at night, and the fireworks are awesome, our whole family enjoyed Disneyland. Although we queued two hours to have photo with Mickey and Minnie Mouse, and food is pricey around 99hkd per head it is still worth it. Overall experience was magical ",4
"I've enjoyed the shops, shows and the place, however there's no many activities and games for adults",4
"Ah   who would come to HK with their kids and not go Disneyland? It's a must see for a family and while the rides are not so spectacular, my 4 year old seemed to have absolute a cracker of a time, especially the toy story land parachute ride. We loved the parade and also the fireworks as well. Because we went during christmas season, they even had artificial snow all over main street! Super time!The only thing I need to warn about is the food. Generally the meals here are extremely expensive. We had our lunch at the Explorer's Club Restaurant and it cost us almost HKD600 for just 3 sets. One set was around HKD180! And it was horrible food. We had our dinner at Plaza Inn and the food was a thousand times better and the the price more reasonable. So I advise to avoid the Explorer Club Restaurant and just go for the chinese restaurant at Plaza Inn. Not because we are chinese and like chinese food, but because Explorer is a rip off and the food taste like dirt. I dont know about the other restaurants.",4
"We've been to HK Disneyland several times and at my son's request we go back every year to celebrate his birthday. This time we took the baby brother as well.It's easy to reach by MTR which includes a great purpose built train that kids love.The park fee is not cheap allowing you enter to rides. There are some rides only suitable for holder bigger kids but those for younger ones are sufficient to keep them busy for the day.Lines can be significant. In our last visit the most we waited was 30 minutes which was ok.Near the attractions if you are lucky you'll find the action figures to greet kids and grownups (Buzz, Darth Vader, etc) Disney characters are also around.You can find several restaurants that get really busy and food is... fast food. Some more than others but in general, from the 3 I tried you will not remember the day because of the food.In general it's a nice family outing, particularly if you dodon't go during summer) despite being a bit expensive.",4
"Was impressed with the cleanliness of the entire compound as it was very dirty when I was there 4 years ago. Kudos to the cleaning team!Very long queues for the rides as well as photo taking with the characters.The app wasdon't very user friendly as I wasdon't able to find the schedule of shows, etc. Overall kids love the place.",4
"Let me preface this review by saying that I've been to Disneyworld in Florida more than a few times, and my review of Hong Kong Disneyland will be compared to what I'm familiar with in ways that may not be fair.We purchased the  Play and Dine  ticket online for $539 hkd, a special offer that includes a combo meal along with regular one day admission. When we went to pick up our tickets we were told that we did not qualify for the lunch voucher because we had booked the ticket from a Hong Kong IP address. There was nothing in the terms and conditions that excluded booking the ticket from a Hong Kong IP address. After a very unpleasant 15 minutes of arguing with guest services, we were finally given our lunch vouchers. The vouchers were good for up to a $139 hkd meal in either a standard or Deluxe Restaurant. I'll come back to this later in my review.Getting to Hong Kong Disneyland was really quite easy. We took the MTR from Jordan Road Station, with one transfer, finally arriving at Sunny Point. At Sunny Point you can catch the Disneyland train right to the park. Once you get off the train it's about a 10 minute walk to the entrance gate. So the trip is both convenient and pleasant. We have the Hong Kong octopus MTR card and it cost about $20 hkd for the entire trip, so its also affordable.Once inside the park the first thing we noticed was it is on a much smaller scale than Disney World in Florida. I would guess that the park is about 25% the size of Disney World. Knowing that the lines can get very long we immediately headed out to the most popular ride, Space Mountain. In Hong Kong, the ride is called  Hyperspace Mountain.  There were no lines and we were able to move through without any wait. To beat the crowds we proceeded from Space Mountain to the other more popular attractions namely, Grizzly Gulch roller coaster, Mystic Pointe, and the River cruise. Again we found no wait.After seeing the main attractions, we had lunch at the Explorers Club in Adventureland. The food was expensive, small portions, and of cafeteria quality. There were no lines and no problem finding a table to sit. The combo meal was $139 hkd.At 3 o'clock the parade came through. The Disney cast were able to keep everybody organized, with those closest to the street having to sit down so that the row behind them on the park benches could view the parade. This was a very nice touch.Overall the day was enjoyable, but if you're expecting a theme park similar to that found in the US you wodon't find it here. The attractions are on a much smaller scale, with a fraction of the detail that went into the park in Florida. Highly recommended.",4
"Put your elder behavier down. Throw the stress away!! Be young again!!You will be full filled your children mind here by all Walt Disney's cartoons you grew up with.Gingerbread Latte Coffee at Market House Bakery is a nice start.There are many theme parks you should try. What I recommend are  Mickey & the Wondrous Book     Philhar Magic     Mystic Manor   I dodon't think  Space Mountain     is a good choice. It's too dark, too shake. You woulddon't see anything inside, just feel to be shaken. And you must try  Big Grizzly Runaway Mine Cars       . I am so sad not trying it because it's closed at that time.There are many cafes  restaurants. I have a dinner at Disney Land Plaza Inn Restaurant ($720 for 2 Included with exclusive view of fireworks*). The meals in the courses are Chinese style with a glass of Mocktail, Grape & Pineapple with Soda, which is soooooo good!!*A dinner course with the exclusive view of firework, they will bring you go to the zone at the middle of Mickey Mouse Circle for the fireworks show. I dodon't recommend it because another one will take a seat in front of you, and it's hard to watch the full screen of the show.",4
"This was our second visit to the HK Disneyland with the main purpose to visit the new Star Wars attraction. Young kids enjoyed the Jedi training session but too bad there was age limit applied. However, my kids loved the rides and enjoyed themselves in the park especially in Tomorrowland (hyperspace mountain), Grizzily Gulch (runaway mine cars). We found that the staffs are generally friendly and proficient in English Mandarin. The park is well maintained and still magical! When I accidentally fell down and hurt my arm, the staff on site responded fast and sent me to the first aid room to receive medical treatment. The paramedics were nice and professional.",4
"The tweenagers enjoyed the place very much. I am prone to motion sickness but was caught by the urges to go for the rides early and avoid the queues. It was not a smart move since I was giddy for most of the day after riding the Star Wars rollercoaster. The tweenagers complained of giddiness and heaving stomaches but in 10 minutes were ready for the flying saucer. The storybook show was really lovely, Tarzan tree house was fun. Had lunch at the halal restaurant  oversized servings and for Malaysians with our currency, it was ridiculously expensive. Similarly for the souvenirs, twice what we would have paid two years ago.The tweenagers went for other rides while I watched. I would have liked to see Lion story and paced myself for more rides. The parade was wonderful and the light show was spectacular, Disney characters lit. One day is not enough.",4
"I have been to the original Disneyland in LA and also to Disney World in Florida and my wife has been to Disneyland Japan, but we both kept an open mind going to Disneyland Hong Kong, it would do no justice to Disneyland Hong Kong to make comparisons. That being said Disney HK is a good place to go with kids for sure, but ideally it should be done on a weekday unless you want lots of pain and go on a weekend. I can only imagine the waiting time in the rides on a weekend given the over all size of Disney HK. You have to spend a day here to get to ride all the rides for sure. I also suggest not doing this on a hot summer day, late November is good as it is sunny but cool. Getting to Disney HK is easy with lots of public transportation available so that is not a hassle at all.",4
"I wanted to visit this place for a while now, finally I had the opportunity to visit it and I can say that I was quite pleased. Before I came here, my friends said that this disneyland is small compared to other disneyland. But I think that there is a lot to do and I did not cover even half of it in the whole day I was there.As soon as I entered the park, I saw the train ride. It takes you from one station to the other. I did not do any rides as there were lots of big queues for them. I thought that the shows here are what sets disneyland apart from other theme parks, so I aimed at watching as many shows as possible. If you had time to watch two shows then watch the Lion King show and Mickey's wonderous story (they are both musicals). They are a sight to behold. There is also a parade at 3.30pm and another at 7.30pm. Both are definitely worth seeing. The magical day ended with a fireworks show outside the castle at 9pm.The people are very helpful in Disneyland and if you need help they will go the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable. Before entering the park you have to go through a security check where they make sure you are not carrying any food with you. They prefer you eat their overpriced and greasy food inside the park. There are a lot of greasy and sugary options in there. Not a lot of healthy options and basically no vegetarian options other than potato chips. While they have done well with the shows and customer service, they have a long way to go in terms of food.",4
"My partner and I did this Disneyland in one day and it was perfect for us we got to do and see almost everything, however for a family or avid fan who wants to meet characters and go to all the shops I would suggest doing it in two days. We did go on a weekday so I understand not all of the food places were open but it was very very hard to find food that suited everyone that wasdon't extremely expensive. We got a snack from a stand around mid day but diddon't find somewhere to have a proper meal until about 6:45pm, in tomorrow land where they had a diner well priced and had western food. Going on a Wednesday was perfect there was hardly any lines I think the longest we waited was 15minutes for Winnie the Pooh.We loved our day and would go back again for sure! ",4
"Family friendly theme park that needs no further instruction. It's a good size though the iconic castle is rather small ish compared to Tokyo Disneyland's, but it's really not a problem. Quality rides with a good queue system   really helps with queue cutting attempts from some park visitors. Service wise, more consistent service and enthusiasm can be had from all cast members. There seems to be a lack of happiness and smiles are not that forthcoming. Not really the happiest place on earth I guess.I went with a 1 and 3 year old, and would appreciate more baby care rooms. I found only one there.",4
It was a fun day at HK Disneyland. They had lighting of the Christmas tree when we visited and they even let us experience snow! There were a lot of Disney merchandise as usual. They also sold Mickey Mouse pancake which was cute. The line to have a picture with Mickey Minnie Mouse and Donald Daisy Duck and Tigger Sofia the Princess was tooooo long that we had to content ourselves with photobombing them hehe we didnt try the rides at all as that was not our thing. The place is accessible by mtr. ,4
"I had a 24 hour layover and decided to check it out! It is convenient from the airport, and there is also a luggage valet service so you can check your bags before entering the park. The park is rather small, as I have been to Disney World a couple times, it is MUCH smaller! I was able to quickly walk through all of the areas (I skipped it's a small world, been there  done that!) in just 90 minutes!!! I also got there shortly after they opened on a Monday, so it was not super busy which was great. It cost about $70 USD, and if I had been there all day, it would have been a fair value. There were a couple restaurants closed and a couple rides closed, that's why I gave it 4 stars. The rides I decided to go on, I had a mere 5 minute wait, which was great, no need for the Express Pass! Most of the princesses characters had no more then 15 minutes wait time, some I were able to just walk up to and get a photo that quick!! The longest line was at opening for photos with Holiday Mickey and Minnie  I would guess it would have been about an hour. For those who have been to DisneyWorld  the main Castle here is Sleeping Beauty's, so it's MUCH smaller. Also, TomorrowLand is MUCH smaller as well. There is also a Main St USA, so it has a lot of familiarity! Overall it was a great experience, just wish all of the rides had been open!!",4
"The rides are very much for the kids. The parades are to watch out for. One in the afternoon and one at night. Dodon't miss the night parade at 7pm! The streets fill up fast so you have to find a good spot 30minutes before the parade. The night parade is the most magical!It is very near the airport so you can go straight right after arrival but if you have luggages, it costs 100 hkd per luggage. Stroller rental costs pretty much the same. Be on your most comfortable shoes as there will be too much walking. There is no tram or bike rental that would help you through the walking... just the train that has 2 drop off on both ends of the park.. for the oldies, there are wheel chair available.",4
"We booked the tickets online, but you will still need to queue up at the ticketing counter to redeem it (wondered why bother paying online if you cadon't save the time in the process?)The layout is similar to the rest of the Disneyland theme Parks. Girls enjoyed the Grizzliy bear ride (did 4X), Hyperdrive Space Moutain (2X), It's a small world, Dumbo, River Ride and Fireworks at the end of the day. There was also the snow at the Main Street in the evening. Overall a good day out, girls enjoyed themselves. ",4
It was our first Disney experience and it was magical as always dreamed. All the shows are amazing with perfection specially the final one with the fire crackers and lighting around the castle. Too much to cover for a day!,4
Great day out with the kids...very much for the kids. Many many rides and activities. Finished the day with Disney character parade which is a must for the kids. Probably worth to bring your own lunch as the lines and quality of food is below par. Definately worth the trip! ,4
"Super jam pack season, December 2016, All the carton Character Wearing red costume. In festive mood. My advise for parents are hold your kids hand dodon't loss sight of your love ones. The Theme park is so big and crowded. Foods are expensive. Drinks are super expensive HK$ 35 for 325ml Coke. Jedi Performance is must watch. Dodon't try the Space Roller coaster, you will regret ha ha... my heart is almost thrown out. Face turn pale and hair stand up. Dodon't try if you have high blood.",4
First visit to disney hong kong with my young kids and parents.The atmosphere does seem abit lacking as compared to disney tokyo probably due to the scale of the theme park. On the positive note queues for rides are fast in theme parks terms (no more than 10mins wait for rides during my visit) hence we get to experience all the attractions we wanted to during the visit. Weather was fantastic too.On the negative aspect will probably be the quality of the food. Food quality was pretty bad considering what we paid for thuo the serving was big.Taxi is easily available when we left at around 5.30pm as compared to the older theme park in hong kong.,4
"Very easy to get to using public transport. We went there on a Monday, Halloween and thought that it would be very busy. However it wasdon't too bad. Getting there was super easy, just a couple of train rides and you're at Disneyland Station. We got there a little after 12pm and still had plenty of time to do all the things we wanted to do.The lines were pretty quick, the longest time we waited was about 30min for Mystic Manor as they had technical issues for most of the day, so when it did re open everyone wanted to go on it. But it was worth the wait, different from the other rides I've been on. Download the app as it will shows you with the wait times for the lines and help you plan your day better. Even though we got there a little later in the day, we were able to go on all the rides we wanted to, got to watch the shows and parades and had a very leisurely day. No running around trying to fit it all in, so going on a weekday was a great idea. We stuck around until the fireworks, which were amazing!The only thing I wasdon't a fan of was the cost of the food! Very expensive, but then again most attractions are.",4
"We first visited on a Friday afternoon and pretty much walked on all the big coaster rides. Grizzly Gulch was fantastic and we really enjoyed Mystic Manor. The night time parade was lovely and the fireworks fantastic. We found the cast members pretty friendly. The Lion King show was spectacular. We returned on Sunday and naturally it was much busier but we still rode Spacemountain and met R2D2. The rides for the young children seemed very long   we were lucky to go on the Pooh ride on Fri night after the fireworks which enabled us to only wait 15 mins. It is pretty much shoulder to shoulder here on a busy day and the shops are insane ! I dodon't know where people get their money from to spend so much!! Lol. We have visited Disneyland and Disneyworld in the USA and of course HK is much smaller but it was fascinating to visit a diff Disney all the same, especially an Asian one.",4
Super time spent with family. Tickets were pre booked (advisable for all tourists else there are long queues for tickets). Be prepared for long walks....can be tiring but its very well maintained and has a nice touch to it. Kids will freak out on all the fun activities...plenty of options for snacks and meals. A bit over priced though !!! You may want to carry your own snacks. Carry plenty of water.,4
"My daughters are enjoying themselves in the park. Too many people and the queue are too long. Not change to take photo with Mickey and Elsa. however, the girls really enjoy themselves there. the fireworks is really wonderful and it is amazing. the parade is also wonderful.",4
A good tip is to get a two day ticket in advance as the queue at the park can be long. You have to be quick on your feat if you want to do this in one day. Check out the shows they are good. 3 big theatres. Take food with you as the meals are   10 each coke is   3. There is a bag search before entry for alcohol but normal drink and food are allowed. Stay for the night parade as this is worth it.,4
"It only has a fraction of the rides that other Disney parks have, but they do it well, and the shows were spectacular. You can probably do the park in 1 2 a day, but you will be missing out on a few attractions. If you are only interested in thrill rides, then not the thing for you, but it is, if you want the full disney experience. ",4
I enjoy a lot there with my family and friends there many rides from extreme to mildPrade is the must see attraction of the parkpark have many food courts and restaurants and I like the food  It need full day to visit and enjoy it fully with family,4
"First of all I must admit  I am a huge Disney Fan! I absolutely love DIsneyland. The beauty is in the details and you can tell there is so much passion involved in making the park. But I have been to other Disneyland and theme parks, and to be honest the HK one was a bit downer. Its small compared to others, less rides. Must visit for the Disney experience if you are a fan. The fireworks in the evening are spectacular. But otherwise, can give it a miss. ",4
"Went to Disneyland Hong Kong again last November 2016. What can I say? There's just something about Disneyland that makes you feel like a kid again. Wife's eyes lit up as soon as the train to Disneyland arrived at the station.Let's begin with getting there. Getting to Hong Kong Disneyland is easy. Use the MTR. Just be prepared for a couple of train changes.For the tickets, we would recommend purchasing online to avoid the long queues. Just present the printed tickets or mobile vouchers at the turnstiles for a quick entrance.There are a couple of shows one shoulddon't miss, the Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. The production values for the Festival of the Lion King is awesome! Definitely worth a watch. Just be at the attraction 20 30 minutes before the show starts to get good seats.As for the rides, they were just okay. Not really that exciting. Understandably, most are geared for the younger kids.Food...lots of food venues. Most are catered for the Asian diet (rice, noodles, etc) but there are some Western dishes as well (burgers and steaks). Restaurants can get pretty crowded during lunch time so either eat early or late. Obviously, everything costs a lot more. A few dollars can be saved by buying a ticket with food package online.There are 2 parades, one at 3pm and the other at night. These are also cool. There was also a Christmas Tree lighting ceremony around 6pm. Mickey and the rest of the gang sang Christmas songs by the huge tree in Main Street.During our first trip years ago, a huge fireworks display would light up the sky around 8pm. This was accompanied by popular Disney tunes. Unfortunately, it rained a bit during our most recent stay so the show was cancelled.Disneyland Hong Kong does not compare to the other Disneylands. The park is smaller and the attractions are simpler. However, it's still an enjoyable experience for the kids and the kids at heart.By the way, avoid going during weekends and holidays. We went on a Friday and it wasdon't so bad.Would we visit again? If it were just the wife and I, we'd probably skip it since we've already been there a couple of times. However, I'd take my son as soon as he's old enough to enjoy the place.",4
"Kids have a blast at disneyland.  Very well organised at all counters and all stalls.  The only minus is if you are a vegetarian, there is hardly anything you can eat. The veg pizza tastes bad.",4
"Thought things would be a bit more dramatic, i.e. 'Disney', but it was a little low key. Not many bigger rides either but fine for our 2 year old. Worth going but doesdon't beat Florida or Paris.",4
"Beautiful place, beautiful living characters, great rides and staff on the rides were friendly   which is rare in the city. There were so many baby strollers. I've never seen such a massive stroller parking like that before.Many good deals at the Merchandise Stores. We bought a lot of stuff from three different stores. There was no problem at the two stores, but this one store: everytime we asked for 3 4 shirts in different sizes they ALWAYS brought the wrong ones. When we corrected they seem upset... Wow, If you can memorize it maybe try to write it down next time. Still from the same store: there were misunderstanding at the cashier since the staff diddon't understand English well. We tried to tell them that we havedon't got one of our item yet, they thought we wanted to buy one more item with discount (should buy 3 for discount). The 'Supervisor' was screaming a bit, and showing unfriendly gestures. She really lose it. When they finally understood, she just put the item into the bag without saying anything and still put on the unpleasant expression.If you cadon't be nice and friendly that's fine  we used to it after traditional market experience anyway   but at least be professional!",4
"Much smaller than Florida or California or Paris. MUCH smaller with fewer rides. However in some ways that's a positive   it was not mobbed with people, there were good facilities for food and drink, plenty of places to sit and relax. Overall a pleasant day.",4
"I have been to Hong Kong Disneyland with my family in last year. I remember that the weather of starting day was bad. However, we went to Hong Kong Disneyland in the second day. Fortunately, the weather of the second day was better. When we arrived there, we saw amazing thing which was a few of people in Hong Kong Disneyland. We argued that it was because of the weather. In this case, we played games faster. However, compare to Tokyo Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland is smaller, the equipment of Hong Kong Disneyland also is fewer, and the consumption between Hong Kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland is the same. Although Hong Kong Disneyland is not as good as Tokyo Disneyland, there is also attracting me to go. It is because it is near to Macau, and has the same language. Recently, I saw the news that is about extending Hong Kong Disneyland. Therefore, I will go there one more time.",4
"unexpectedly very hot in mid November. wasdon't prepared. but because it was not peak season, still made the most of the day although there are rides which are under maintenance. the parades are a sight to see! the shows as well.",4
"Not on the scale of Orlando but still plenty to do on a day's visit. It has the same magical atmosphere as Florida and an enjoyable day out for old, young and anyone in between.",4
The smallest Disneyland in the world.  Take the MTR Tung Chung Line is the most convenient way to the theme park.,4
"Came on sunday Was expecting long queues, but guess the newly openwd shanghai disneyland has pulled the crowds away. Making the place more pleasant and less crowded. If compared to tokyo this place seems second to that. The sense of feeling in disneyland is lmited to the main street Elsewhwere for the other worlds, we feel like in just some theme park. ",4
The theme park is very nice all of the Disney characters are there. More over the place is clean and the park attendants are nice and friendly.,4
"We had magical memories about this place. This is not just for kids but for adult too. Sadly, we diddon't ride all the rides that was there because of long lines and we only have limited time. So we just rode the train that will let you see the whole disneyland. It was such a nice to remember       ",4
great place but do not rely on the staff for any information as they seem confused some of them  and u can miss out on important events there.,4
"I was traveling to HK on business and went to the park as a solo traveler. This is my first experience to a Disney park but I've been to Universal, Ferrari world, dream world etc. in comparison I thought this is more suitable for kids. Very few selective rides for adults. When you check the park map you see they have elaborated even little things like walk through snow whites castle, wishing well, fairy garden etc but actually there's nothing much to experience. I went there around 10 am and since I had e ticket my entry was easy. You have machines to get the ticket. By 3pm I had finished all different sections of the park and finished rides for adults. Hyperspace ride in tomorrow land and big grizzly mountain ride will give you adrenaline rush. Then there are some magical musical show with Mickey and few other like toy story parachutes fall. There's a ferry ride and visit to Tarzan's tree house which was so boring. I took adventure park boat ride and it is also recommended for kids. There's a train ride around the park which is good for you to get an idea of all attractions and how crowded they are. I coulddon't do lion king concert since I had a flight to catch. At 3pm the parade started. It was short and only about 6 carriages and was over within 30 mins. I left after this but heard there are light shows in the night but I coulddon't wait since I had a flight. But overall I thought you dodon't need full day for this park unless you have kids. You can either come at 10 and leave by 4 or come around 12 and stay back for night shows. It never extremely crowded. Queues were bearable. I went on a weekday so probably weekend could be different. I think this is good as a Disney theme park but it's very small so plan your day accordingly. Recommended for kids but not much for adults ",4
We went on a Friday and the park was practically empty until lunchtime.Castle is smaller and less imposing than Paris and Florida but in a very prefer backdrop.White knuckle rides are scarce but there are a couple that are good.The park is very very clean   cast members are friendly enough   not on the same scale as US cast members.Food is hopeless (same as all Disney parks)   overpriced and garbage but you know that before you go !Definitely worth a day there.,4
"when i come there on sunday, the crowd is manageable although to take picture with Micky and Mini at the main street still have to wait long enough, the food taste so much better than my last visit years ago",4
"Great fun and at this time of the year (start of November) there were not that many queues. While this time of the year makes the weather perfect and the crowds much smaller, the open times are not long enough and ride that need a refurb are done at this time. The RC Racer was closed and the Autopia was gone, I assume to make room for the new Stark Ironman ride. Gates dodon't open until 10:30am and it closes at 7:30pm so it made it difficult to have dinner and continue on the rides.",4
"Hong Kong Disneyland was my childhood which I really want to go. When I was young, the most exciting was hearing my family that wanted to take to visit and play Hong Kong Disneyland. In Hong Kong Disneyland, you can find that it was actually princess life. It was because that there are play an ancient house, roads and even had a castle. Additional, it also had the roller coaster, it was so exciting. However, Before, whether went to Hong Kong Disneyland that was determined by my family choice. But now, that was my choice. I would like to date my friends and nephew and niece to play. It was because that in my view, no matter adult or child, they still had right to play. According this view, in December 2015, I date my family to go Disney, the weather was great, sunshine when we started to play. However, it suddenly raining and brainstorm. Therefore, I suggest you that before you go Disney, you must check the weather conditions.",4
"A school holiday treat for my 5 years old Son and he had a blast today the only set back was my Son was exhausted by 4pm, I had a blast too..",4
"Though we started early morning and stayed till closing fireworks one day trip wont be enough to cover all the attractions at Disneyland. The experience was pleasant but the summer is a bummer. Shows were all fabulous especially the 4D show , will be one of the best you experience. Should have more options for eating out as one is spending full day there.",4
Twas a great trip with nieces and 3 nephews .   Hongkong disneyland was enjoyable due to the Halloween atmosphere.    So much fun. The weather was good and not too sunny.,4
Went here with a friends kids .  Had a great day out with many different rides etc.Easy to get around and very easy to get to on Train.,4
Great place! Your day will go by and you wodon't even know it. Obviously went there for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! Too bad the parade got canceled though.,5
"I can go on talking about Disneyland. Whatever I say about it, is less. Disneyland is all about your childhood dreams come true. Starting from the Entrance, the environment, popcorn, the shows, everything. Even the MTR Trains and the station is specially designed. In my opinion one should by a Two Day Ticket to explore it well if you have time. Else few of the attractions may remain incomplete in one day. An online Two Day Ticket can save around HKD 100 in comparison to an on spot ticket.  Must NOT Miss  attractions include the Jungle River Cruise, Micky's Phillhar Magic (a 4D Show), The Lion King ShowIt is better to have some home work regarding the Show Timings so that you can maximise the number of shows you can cover. It is better to avoid Sundays or the public holidays to avoid rush.",5
Disneyland never cease to amaze me! I've been to Disneyland florida and I thought I have exhausted the kid in me but nope! I still had so much fun in disneyland hong kong. 2 DL off my bucketlist and more to come!     ,5
"We spent the day here with our grown kids and I have to admit we had a great time. It seems the kids never tire of Disney. There aren   t as many rides as the states Disney parks but they have some great ones no less. Do the haunted house, catch the lion king show, space mountain, and the iron man experience to list a few. They have lots of shops that you have to spend some money in of course. The kids will love the day!",5
It was indeed the happiest place on earth! My family had really fun and it made my daughter's birthday a memorable one!,5
"This place is HUGE! Definately need more than one day. We had 3 children aged 11, 9 & 6 and they loved it. A great variety of rides and attractions for all ages. Food options were fantastic with 3D models of what you were ordering. Staff were fantastic, very helpful. An awesome family experience. ",5
There is nothing more to say except that you become a child once again as you step inside Disneyland in HK!  Easy to go and come out with dedicated trams and subway stations.  Wait for the parade at sunset it is definitely worth waiting!,5
"We bought a 2 day tourist ticket via Klook which made it better value. It was good to have a day to get our bearings and a second day to go on the rides we missed and to go back on our favourite ones again. It also means less queuing.The shows and parades were amazing. We saw the Lion King, Moana and Mickey   s Wondrous Book. Unfortunately there is some works on so the Castle isn   t visible and the train is not open. We still had a magical time.  ",5
"GO early if you want to do photos with the signboards and Mickey Donald Duck. Otherwise, you could spend an hour just waiting in line to get a free photo. The paid photo is also available at a price.Tomorrow land Iron Man was excellent and we did it twice.Philar Magic is really awesome.Fantasy Land is great for the rides.Adventure Land has some nice opportunities to take photos with Tarzan, a treetop house visit, a boat cruise for kids.Grizzly Gulch was one of my favourites, Roller Coaster ride was worth the 15 minute wait.",5
We have been to Hong Kong Disneyland a few times already but we still want to come back. Why? Because there are rides we were too chicken to try the first visits that we finally had the courage to try and we ended up loving them. We love the Big Grizzly Mountain ride. We thought it will be too scary but we love it now. Will be back again!,5
We visited here on a Wednesday. We arrived for opening and found the queue times to be short and had done most the rides we wanted to by early afternoon. Unfortunately there were no fireworks due to the castle being renovated and we have seen many parades at Disney world so we decided not to stay for the evening. ,5
"Took a five year old and a two year old. Could not fault anything other than a hire pram being pinched, which was quickly replaced.  Staff amazing. If you can stay at one of the hotels, do so.  Makes it all much easier.",5
"I went to Hong Kong Disneyland with a little trepidation as our family had been to Disneyland in California 6 months previously.No trepidation needed, we all loved HKDL! Loved loved loved it.Yes, its much smaller than California and there are not as many fast paced rides, none the less, we had a great day. The park is beautiful and the experience is just like being at Anaheim.We went on a day where large amounts of rain were expected, so numbers were down. We had line ups of less than 5 minutes on most rides. The rain held off until 3pm and we'd been able to go through all of the park by that time and we were going back over rides we wanted to do again. Once the rain started we found that most people huddled under their umbrellas, where as we went on all the undercover rides over and over.I totally recommend HKDL, just keep in mind it is smaller and slower paced than other Disney parks.",5
"This Disneyland is a lot of fun. There are many rides that are good like the Iron man experience, hyperspace mountain, the toy story car, and many others. I went to Shanghai Disneyland as well and that one is so crowded you can   t go on a lot of rides but in Hong Kong we were able to ride almost every ride in a day. Lines were very short and the park is small so it   s easy to get around. ",5
"HKDL got different event for different period. Like Jan Feb for Chines New Year, Apr May for Spring Carnival, then Summer, Halloween and Christmas, each event got different theme for both charaters costume and decorate, and sometimes might got the special daily parade too. Thats why recommend to check clearly which event you want to join before you make the disney trip. If you dodon't like crowded, Mar & November without any event happening will be your choice!",5
"Visited here with the family and had a very memorable experience. It didn   t seem as big as Anaheim, but very clean and well maintained.  Received priority queuing passes but didn   t need them as the lines were very short.",5
"We first did Disneyworld in Orlando some 40 yrs ago with our 2 year old.Back then, we had to buy different value tickets for various rides whereas that has changed and the entry fee now covers all rides etc, except for food. What hasn   t changed. The place is remarkably clean and well maintained given the number of visitors they see each day. Some rides had a long wait ie 40 minutes, so skipped them till later in the day ie 4 5pm, and the wait period was down to less than 10minutes.A very full day. We got there around 10.30 am and left when the street parade finished at around 9.15pm. Exhausting, but simply loved it ",5
"Had a great time at Disneyland. Great, but can be busy on Saturday and Sunday. Only point to note, is that the park opens at 10:00 but the first zone does not open until 10:30. I purchased priority tickets, if going at the weekend I would recommend priority tickets. Queues smaller during the week and not sure if priority needed.",5
"Even though the rain set in for most of the day, as an adult we still had a fun time at Disneyland Hong Kong",5
"I love Disney, I even worked at Disney World in college so when we came to Hong Kong I knew we had to visit. I diddon't visit the one in Paris when I went and I regret it. Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest of the Disney Parks. We were able to ride all the rides in 3 hours when we first arrived at 9:30 a.m. I loved the Wondrous Book of Mickey and the Mystic Manor ride. I also liked the new Ant Man and Wasp ride b c it's like the Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger's ride in Orlando. I also liked how all the characters were dressed up for Easter and the Easter decorations they had up as well. I loved both parades, the afternoon and the night time one reminded me of the Electro Magic Parade that was in Orlando. If you're a Disney fan then you must visit Hong Kong Disneyland!",5
"Small disneyland catering to kids, but they have some nice rides including the new Ant Man ride. Pricey food and somewhat long queues but that is part of the theme park. Try to go in the morning and then again in the evening, best is to stay one day at the hotel to maximize the park.",5
Awesome attractions that blew my mind away. The attraction is filled with amazing rides and entertainment. There are also halal food that definitely cater to my needs. Glad to be able to meet Mickey and friends.,5
Great fun for the family.  The fact that it is a smaller park than other Disney   s is a plus.  Facilities seem new and loads of different games.,5
Love this place very clean and safe have it own MRT to get here !!! Night time is beautiful too many things to do,5
Went for day xx brilliant food x was holiday day for local people so very busy buy so polite .. had a great time,5
"I would recommend to go through below tips to navigate easily and manage most of your time at this marvellous amusement park.We visited during new year with 2 year old infant so some points could be helpful for fellow travellers.Tip: 1. dont take big luggage or even trolley bag while entering as they wont let you inside plus you have to PAY to use thier storage service also..only BACKPACK (read not too big) is allowed.2. Book online from klook app to get discount. This only saves time as on spot booking as long que.3. Always reach disneyland by its special metro train as its interior is superb and gives you great feel.4. Take map or use free wifi to access their app for show timings and ride schedule.5. Do not miss any of the live shows as they are worth watching and direction is highly creative.6. Always ask from disneyland employees at ride entrance exit for stickers as they usually keep and gives it for free as soveniour, even when you leav door person can also give you some JUST REMEMBER TO ASK POLITELY.Rest this is worth visiting and whatever age group you belong you cannot miss DISNEYLAND LA LA LAND!!!",5
"A very small Disney and the castle was being worked on but overall had an amazing time. Was able to ride all the rides we wanted to ride. Very nice staff, lovely experience.",5
Superb atmosphere in HK Disneyland. Must enter the park by 8am soon it   s opened and have more than enough things to do until dawn. Better check which amusements are under renovation as usually it has 1 or 2 parks under construction everyday. If this is your last item in HK tour you can check in luggage at Kowloon station and visit Disneyland. But recommend to reserve two day ticket if you want to try out all excursions. Fantastic creation and life time snaps to capture in 48 hours.,5
"You will love this place for the fun, food and the nostalgia it creates! Even when you are not a great mickey fan, you have enough avenues to enjoy.   Its not just for kids; even adults enjoy this.",5
Just so friendly.  Lovely food.  It was Halloween time and we had a great time.  It was good that y on could see everything in in one day.,5
Took some family to park for their first time at a Disney park. They loved it and it was a joy to see the kid in their eyes as they enjoyed all that it had to offer. Weather was great as well.,5
"My first ever Disneyland, couldnt ask for more. Rides were good, shows were good, performers were all excellent! Rides more towards kids friendly. But theres a couple of adult rides. Overall a great experience.",5
this is a wonderful place to bring your kids of all ages!!!it was very well kept and clean!! alot of rides for young kids...amzaing staffs around!there were halal foods which was wonderful!! it was fantastic at night and the light parade was fantabulous!!!Its a MUST GO for parents with young kids!!,5
"Who wouldn   t enjoy Disneyland? Hong Kong Disneyland is really easy to access. They have special metro to Disneyland and special designed. You better get there before 10 and directly queue until the parks open (at 10), so once it open you can enjoy many rides without long queue. Just be there on weekdays, avoid weekends!For muslim traveler, you shouldn   t be worry since you can find halal restaurant inside called Tahitian Terrace. It is located close to Tarzan   s Treehouse. The price ranges from 120 150 HKD if i   m not mistaken. I enjoy big rides but avoid big thrill drop. I   ve tried almost all rides except Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. Shame, i   m afraid of fast backward drop lol. So far I enjoyed Ant Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle, Hyperspace Mountain, Mystic Manor, and Mickey   s Phillarmagic!",5
"Although this is apparently a small Disneyland, I loved it. Being from NZ, it was the first Disney I had been to and everything was amazing. The shows, the rides, the attention to detail. Highly recommend it, although you really only need one day. never queued for longer than 10 mins on a Tuesday in March.",5
"We bought a package through the Disney website. We started at the Explorers lodge and the package included several priority passes (like fast passes). We actually never needed to use them because the longest wait time for a ride was 10 minutes. All of the shows and rides are in English and most cast members speak English really well. This park is the smallest of Disneyland parks in the world, but we still felt like there was enough to keep us busy for our day and a half that we were there. The bus shuttles were very clean and ran on time.Would definitely go again next time we are in Hong Kong.",5
We have been to LA and Florida Disney MANY times so we were told we would be disappointed with this one. Not at all! We loved it. It had different rides and shows while still having the same layout and Disney feel. It is expanding a whole lot at the moment. My suggestion would be to add more food restaurants as the food lines were as long as the ride liens. We purchased online tickets and bought a partial ride upgrade. We wanted the full ride upgrade but it was sold out for the day. IMHO it is well worth it! We spent opening to closing there and loved it. The midway games were fun,5
"already went the for 4th times and it will never enough. It was a truly magical experience. Even though it is a small park but full of excitement. The parades, the rides, the characters and cast members all blend to make a great day with the kids. Going there by MTR was so easy.",5
"My wife and I brought 2 daughers in law to Hong Kong Disney recently. It has been more than 5 years since our last visit to Disney. Many new attractions have been added and we enjoyed very much during the visit. Our favourite ride is the Mountain Runaway Mine Car even with our age ranging from 12 to 59. In fact, we played 4 times all together and if time allowed, we would play more ! Take the ride disregarding your age when you visit Hong Kong Disney and have fun.",5
Definitely a fun place to visit whilst in Honkers. We had loads of fun there and would recommend a visit,5
"Everyone loves Disneyland !!! If you are traveling with young kids I would really recommend staying at one of the three Disney hotels. The hotels provide coaches, thereby making it more convinient. We stayed at the Disney hotel for two nights, the high point being the visit by the Disney characters at breakfast .  We also took a two day pass, it made the whole experience more relaxed and easy going.  Vegetarian food is only available at one of the restaurants. But the taste and quantity is good.  The park itself is well designed. There are enough options to engage very young kids to older kids.  The parade is not to be missed, as well as the different photo opps with all the Disney characters.  Other than the rides my kids really enjoyed the opportunity to dress up as young Jedi   s n fight the evil forces . A great family vacation. ",5
"This was a true highlight of our trip, they suspend reality so well in the park each lands attention to detail is incredible in decor, the sounds   smells, the staffs costumes and personas. There is truly something for everyone of all ages. The lines where very well managed with even on opening day of the new marvel ride just around 40 mins wait. Make sure you use smart fast track passes where you can they are free at some rides.It   s fair to say this park is much smaller than the others but somehow in that it becomes so much more charming.The staff could not do more for people bending over backwards they clearly love their jobs. They just seemed to intuitively just know what people needed.Would strongly recommend anyone with a day or two to spare. The current two day ticket offer was great for us as we did most of the flagship rides day one and the show and on the second day the other items.With this very close proximity to the airport and cheap bag storage it   s an ideal place to stop over or visit on your last day like we did heading straight to the airport after. ",5
Bucket list unlock.      One of the best trip we ever haven. Enjoy every single second inside Disneyland must to try every rides of it.,5
Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely a must see. It is a smaller park but what it loses in size it makes up for in quality. Hong Kong is currently home to the only Marvel themed rides and they do not disappoint. Hong Kong has many of the standard rides shows you expect from Disney but it also maintains a variety of exclusives. Hong Kong also has a lot of exclusive merchandise especially pins. Also most if not all of the rides are Bilingual. ,5
"Buy your discounted tickets on Klook (thus no ticket queueing when you arrive), get the MTR to Disneyland (35 mins from Hong Kong station where we had breaky at the Pret A Manger in the shopping mall there.). Take in lots of water as it   s expensive in the park. We also took in kids food and snacks as they are expensive and not great quality, you get searched on entry by if you have a good bag with many compartments, it   s easy to hide! Get there at 1015am latest and when the gates open at 1030am go straight for the Star Wars or ToyStory area. Only 2 or 3 rides have the fast pass, if you want to go to the Winnie the Pooh, use it there as the queue was long. Toy story land was great and big queues for the green parachute ride, so that   s one to go to first if you don   t start with Star Wars. The 245pm street show was very good (no need to get there early) but we were disappointed not to see the lion king show that is not currently on (download the free Disney HK App   will tell you what   s happening when). The Lion King show is a not to miss apparently and you have to get there before the street show ends or you might not get in. Recommend the musical show in the big Theatre, that   s next to the Small world. Saw the 1230pm show with lots of singing and Mickey Mouse and goofy !Our highlight of the day though was Mine train  amazing. Went on it 5 times.All in all, a good long day out   too tired to stay for the 730pm lights show !",5
"Despite being one of the smaller parks of the company, two days are really worth while with a five year old and a baby. It is most relaxing as you will find enough time to enjoy. The transfer with the metro and the disney line works like a charme, all super clear signposted. Truly a fun day out with the kids. ",5
This is the 10th time to Hong Kong Disneyland. I'll always recommend going on a weekday as on the weekends everybody goes with their children and the queues are doubled. The castle and other attractions were shut but they always inform guests on their website. The staff are nice and speak English so there's no need to be intimidated by that.,5
"Fantastic  Nice place and kids friendly  Easly to get food in that area.   Better buy ticket from online, traveloka i guest  Because we can save our time before come to this place. Near from bus station and MTR station",5
"What is there not to love about Disneyland? The attraction is well run, well worth a visit and a fun day out for all ages. The park is easily accessible from Hong Kong central by train and highly recommend the street parade and staying to see the park light up at night.",5
"Even though it is smaller, there is great rides and and wonderful atmosphere. The paint the night parade is a must. Hard to find good lunch food choices but diddon't matter. Great shops. Longest ride line was 20 minutes. 4 year old daughter did princess makeover and that was super cute. Ask all staff members for stickers, they generally have different ones in their pockets. We did 2 days and could have easily done a 3rd.",5
"We tried to buy our tickets online the day before but after entering payment details it said try later. We tried with a different card and it still gave the same message. The credit card company said the payment was taken but we had not received a booking confirmation. We took a taxi from TST area and it was not expensive and in an air conditioned car it was a pleasant journey. We arrived about 10:30. The next day at the park we had to waste time at guest relations where we were told the payments had not been taken, so we bought our tickets at the park. We will need to check our card statements to ensure no payments have been taken!We did not know if we should add the priority pass to our tickets as there was no information on how long the queues were at the entrance, unlike parks we have visited in the US, so we purchased them.Whilst at The Iron Man ride the priority cards were scanned on entry then scanned again before getting on. This is where two of the priority rides were recorded as used but it should only have been recorded as once   we did not know this at the time. When we tried to use our priority pass for the 3rd time later we were told we had none left. This was very embarrassing in front of the other park Guests. We said it could have occurred at Iron Man as they scanned it twice and was told to go back to Iron Man! We were tired by this point from going around the park and did not want to walk back there and so said we would go to Guest Relations instead. Guest Relations were not apologetic. We were offered the priority ticket for our next visit but we are from the UK and do not expect to return! We were offered a soft drink or popcorn   whoopy dah! We had just had lunch   no thank you. So we left with it not being resolved to our satisfaction.Please be careful if you buy online and if you have purchased a priority pass!The queues were about 15 30 minutes.We did have a great time at Disney but the pre purchase and priority pass experiences have left us feeling dissatisfied rather than elated and we still need to check payments had not been taken, so our negative Disney experience continues, even once back in the UK for the next few weeks.",5
Went to HK Disneyland via the MTR ( easy to get there and back) early March. Most days before were light showers but not cold. Our day was no rain :) and it took only 5 minutes to get onto the rides we wanted. Wife had never done a disney trip before and got some good shots with the Characters. She thoroughly enjoyed the Main Street parade and when we left the train was 2 minutes walk which was easy to get to our hotel.,5
Spent 2 days in Disneyland with my young children. Our 2nd time actually to the park. A must visit to everybody if ever you have the opportunity !,5
"It is my second time coming to HK Disneyland. Unlucky us, it rained. Haha! Although rain didnt stop us from enjoying. Its just sad that the afternoon parade was cancelled. But during the night when the weather cleared, HK Disneyland pushed through the Paint the Night Parade. It was my first time seeing it. 6 years ago there was only fireworks behind the castle (which is now still under renovation).My family and I will definitely go back. Love seeing my little one enjoying Disneyland. ",5
The start of the journey to reach Disneyland by MTR gives a fun ride with the train painted with disney characters. There is also a train within the Disneyland which helps you reach some attractions.,5
"I took my kids to Disneyland on weekday which was a great decision as there was minimum rush. very small queues. we reached there by 10 and started with Tomorrowland. we did all the rides by 5:30pm and left by 6:00 pm. Hyperspace mountain, grizzly mountain, jungle cruise, Mystic Manor and Iron man experience are a must do rides. better to buy tickets food combos from klook. you do not have to stand in queue. just scan barcode and enter. Also, most importantly, take your food coupons just after entry so that you do not ahve to return later to get the coupons. We went to Royal Banquet hall for food. average food. carry water bottle as water is expensive there.",5
"The monastery is really a beautiful place. The giant statues are truly awe inspiring, best seen on a clear day as the clouds can really limit visibility.  Great views from the tram up as well but Nong Ping is very commercial.",5
"Without a doubt, a true Disney experience.The parades, the rides, the characters and cast members all blend to make a great day with the kids.The journey is not long, and the MtR takes you literally to the front gate, so it is convenient for strollers.They will allow you to enter with baby food, as there are not many healthy options inside.With the classics like Small World, the park train, Main St. and the Castle you will not lack any of the    magical    feel.Make sure to have your tickets before as the line can be tedious in the morning, so don   t waste any time at the ticket counter",5
"I've seen many negative posts and comments on HK Disneyland in the past. It is really not that bad. Yes, it is expensive and small but it has tons of rides for all ages.As an HK resident, I always go to Hk Disneyland and the experience is the same every time. Whether it is the parade or the rides, the park is incredible. There has been tons of revamps in the past few years with the farewells to Autopia and Buzz Lightyear Astroblasters but has been replaced with a brand new section in Tomorrowland featuring Iron Man and Ant Man coming in April as well as a brand new revamp of Space Mountain. The staff are extremely helpful and the gift shops have loads of merchandise and souvenirs. The park is also extremely kid friendly. The only negative I can extract from this park is the food price. The food isdon't that bad but for it's quality, it is way too expensive. Since visitors aredon't allowed to bring food in, you might have to starve for a day or buy an expensive meal.If you have lots of free time in HK and want something enjoyable whether with the kids or with your mates, HK Disney is a great park although if you are a major thrill seeker, Ocean Park would be more suited for you.",5
"The place is no less..It is Disneyland :)My kid had amazing fun and the place is massive.It is such a wonderful place to visit when your kid is old enough to qualify all rides.My boy is 112 Cms and pretty much qualified every single ride.I loved adventure land personally as it is involved tree houses,boat rides etc...Mystic Mansion was out of the world..soooo digital and so well done..Eating options for Veg folks are very very very limited.Asked around inside the park about...veg food and people kinda looked at us weird..lol..Vegie Burger was the best we could get at 98$...Was not great but DLand compensated for the non food part..You could have ice creams at 45 HKD and pop corn at the same price.I liked the HK Tea in packed form.it was good.Bus from Disneyland R8 to Lantau costs around 6 HKD(very inexpensive) and i stayed at TST(Tsim Sha Tsui).From Lantau toll toook A21 to go to TST Prat Avenue.Costs around 28 HKD per Adult and around 20 HKD per child below 11.If you take a taxi from Dinsey to TST,considering decent traffic,it would set you off by 205 HKD one way.Peak traffic could cost you around 250 HKD to 275 HKD.Disney is a must visit and we took 2 days to do it as queue(s) are long and minimum it took us 45 mins of queuing to get to any attractions.Infants and toddlers,cap is mandatory and be ready to buckle up and stand the long queue(s),unless you have a priority pass.",5
I really loved Disneyland! The two must rides are the Mystic Manor and the Grizzly Gulch Runaway Mine Trains. Both are excellent. Highly recommend going on a weekday. We did not have a wait longer than 20 minutes any where on a Monday and Tuesday. You dodon't need the Priority Special or Priority Special   on weekdays.,5
"This is my first time going to Disneyland Hong Kong. Unfortunately the Cinderella castle is being renovated and firework show being canceled. Shows such as Mickey and the Wondrous Book or Lion King are amazing. The parade in the afternoon is also good because we can see all Disney cartoon characters coming out. I love big grizzly mountain runaway because it was thrilling. I recommend you to buy popcorn which sold at stand throughout Disneyland, it tastes good.",5
"We went here w my family by invitation. Coming to Disneyland brings the child in you scream and enjoy fun times especially if you have kids w you in the trip. As usual, even on a Mondays, the queing for the long lines of activities will leave you to make ceratin choice events, rides, etc. We did get a roller coaster ride on Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain, photos taken w the Iron Man who was strutting around for poses w us, parades, store buys, etc. But what made the stay most memorable was the live presentation of Lion King musical wc made the final cut of our 'one day' experience @ Disney memorable!",5
Amazing  The shows  Everything was amazing  If u are a Disney fan you should visit   Is in fact a must and if u didnt do it then ur missing out,5
"Relatively small compared to Disney World.  Well maintained, clean,  Admission fee the lowest  is $61  US dollars.",5
"I like shows.  Anaheim has no shows these days.  HK Disney is perfection.  My Chinese friend said,  I would be happy to sleep on that bathroom floor! ",5
"My husband and I love Disney and have visited quite a few of them. Hong Kong is a great park to visit! My favourite ride was the Mystic Manor   it has nothing to do with Disney, but a great little story which is a bit funny and has amazing detail in the ride. I believe it   s for HK only so really special. The run away train is quite deceiving, it starts of slow and you start to think it   s a bit rubbish...but it then surprises you. A winner with us. We got our tickets with Klook as this was by far the cheapest. It even came with the option for a meal deal which was did as it mean we didn   t have to worry about that. The food at Disney wasn   t great but ok. They are working on the castle at the moment and think it may take a while. At the moment it   s tiny! We found it so odd seeing the castle like this, but it   s because they didn   t have the money to build a bit castle. They do not so fireworks at the moment because of this but they are doing a light show at Main Street which was good. HK Disney has a toy story land, built before the one in Orlando. It   s really good but I love toy story. ",5
"It was incredible. We actually rode every attraction in the park, sometimes twice. Our longest wait   15 mins! We didn   t even use the Fast Pass or a Priority Pass. Compared to Disneyland in Anaheim, CA USA   If we had the opportunity; we would rather visit Hong Kong Disneyland. To save money, purchase your tickets and meals via the Klook app. (I do not have any relationship to Klook). Have Fun!",5
Not a trip to HK without swinging by Disneyland. A day will never be enough to check out all the attractions. The place is huge and  seems to always have something every time we visit.,5
"I would say that this place is really good, had so much fun with my friends. But, I'm little sad because one day is not enough to try all their activities and rides. A good place to get rid of all the stress.         ",5
The place was very huge!  There are many fun activities that you can do with your family or friends!  I would recommend you to go to this place if you have children as it is child friendly.,5
Disneyland is a perfect place to unwind and to be child again! I will always find a way to visit all disneyland all over the world!,5
"Magical, fun time at Disneyland. We had 2 wonderful days here. All staff make the visit extra special as they are so kind and patient.  Unfortunately we were disappointed to find the fireworks were cancelled both nights we were there. No warning or explanation.",5
"Last month,my parents,my friends and I went to Hong Kong.We arrived in Hong Kong on February tenth.The weather was cool and sunny.We went to the hotel first,it was clean and the service is good.Almost everything was perfect,the only drawback was the rooms of the hotel were too small that I diddon't have enough place to play.After we had a rest ,we went out to a restaurant.The food it's delicious .we had beef balls,roasted goose,shrimp ravioli and some herbal tea.While we were eating,my dad and I saw a store selling iPads next store and since then I had a new iPad.That's really fantastic.We went Disneyland the day after we arrived.We played many recreational events.There were many people there.We waited for a long time to play it.The Roller Coaster was really cool.If there were not too many people,I really wanted to try that again.After we played for a day,every one was tired,we took a small train back to the hotel.We played the rugby,on last day in Hong Kong.It's very interesting.I tried some times and can played very well.I won a match and I was awarded two white caps and two rugby balls.We need to go home.The trip was great ! I really diddon't want leave.I promised I will came back sooner or later.",5
"My journey started and ended with this magical sentence. Although HK Disneyland is not the biggest Disneyland in the world, no. of attractions and rides are adequate for you to spend a whole day here. Hearing from the news that HK Disneyland is now expanding attractions, adding Frozen land and Marvel land. I believe HK Disneyland will attract countless people in the future. At the same time, it is hoped that the dinning place can be increased because many people finds no place to eat in the park.",5
"The magic starts with the MTR, Mickey shapped windows and handle bars, then a five minute walk into the park with fountains and posters feels like you are already inside. Characters walking around everwhere, fun rides and friendly helpful staff. The parades are amazing . Oh and my kids had a good time too ... second time in 5 years and looking forward to visiting again soon.",5
Smaller than the original but still just as much fun.  Fair way to travel but can be reached by train from HK Central.,5
"It's Disneyland, what more can I say?We went there on Monday. The crowd was big but we were still able to get on many rides:Jungle River Cruise,Slinky Dog Spin,Toy Soldier Parachute Drop,Mystic Manor,Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars,Mickey's Philharmagic,Hyperspace Mountain,IronMan Experience (without fast pass).Special mention about the Mystic Manor. It's said that it's only available in Hong Kong, no other Mystic Manor in any other Disneyland. So we had to go there! Although it wasdon't a thrilling ride, it was still fun & very amusing for us. The MM souvenirs were also very cute. We spent quite amount of money there, because no other MM souvenirs at any other Disneyland shop (not even at the shop at the Hong Kong Airport!). So if you go there & find something you like, BUY it. Dodon't hesitate The only downsides were the Sleeping Beauty Castle & the Winnie the Pooh ride was closed for maintenance.",5
"We went as a family group to Hong Kong Disneyland and had a wonderful time. Our grandchildren just loved it, as did we all. It is good value for money, clean and well laid out. Highly recommended for a fun day out for children and adults.",5
"Easy to get there, only need to take the subway, inside the subway there is also disney decoration so can take pictures while heading there. Very convenience and clean. Inside the disney park, there are lots of cute sounveir shops, area is clean, people are friendly. Lots of disney characters to take pic with, not that long line up, it depends on the time and month you go. Although its not a big disney but you can still spend a whole day there. If you like cute stuff, hongkong disney is a must go. You will buy lots there.",5
"I'm working my way to all the Disney parks around the world. I've already hit Orlando, Anaheim and Paris, this is my fourth location (Tokyo in 2020 and Shanghai 2021). Although this park is slightly larger than Anaheim it doesdon't really feel like it. They have fewer attractions crammed into a small space like the original. Overall the park is clean, themed well and all the cast members we came into contact with were pleasant. I dodon't think you can compare Disney parks to each other, it's just not fair. I like the HK version although a lot of the attractions were mirror images (or very close) to rides in other Disney parks. Although they are branching out with the Iron Man Experience (think Star Tours with Iron Man) and the new Ant Man and Wasp attraction (which was not yet open when we went in February 2019.) Mystic Manor is HK's answer to the Haunted Mansion. It has a compelling story with a character (Albert the monkey) that draws you in and it has great effects. HK DL is almost worth it just for this one attraction, we rode it twice. Although not as big as FL and not as detailed as Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely worth a visit.",5
"HK Disney is the smallest of the Disney Parks and definitely something you can cover in a day. We contemplates doing a VIP tour as we had done in WDW, but left it too late to book and in the end glad that I diddon't waste my money here as it just wasdon't needed unless you were to go on one of the Chinese holidays.We stayed in HK central and took the train out which was easy to do with them running every few minutes, it really diddon't matter if you missed one. Even the return at night despite all the people it was frequent enough that there was never a significant wait. The People are somewhat pushy though it's some form of FOMO(fear or missing out). The train doors open people push in and out. If you finish one ride it seems you need to run to the next one so you can get ahead of 2 people. Rope drop which would normally allow a flow of people into the park was more like the starting gun of the New York Marathon.That said, we loved the park. Favorite ride is Phantom Manor, similar type of ride to Ratatouille in France but with some magical effects. The light show at night is also worth staying to check out.As a tall person 6' 4  I did find myself having to contort myself into seats to fit my legs in. Same thing with Tokyo, but you can fit. I found crossing my legs and moving my feet as far back in the seat as I could before sitting down made a difference.The Lion King show was amazing so I would put that down as a must!",5
"We visited Hong Kong Disneyland as group of family on 1st January of 2019. We thought that the park will be packed since is the holiday season but luckily the park is moderately packed.My thought about this place is a great place to spend your day in your HK trip. The park is very nice and it was smaller than your typical Disney park. Compared to other Disney park I've ever visited, this theme park has shortest waiting time especially for thrill seeker attraction and of course no need to check all the fast pass.You can download the apps beforehand to check the schedule for the parade, map, and waiting time for each attraction. Unfortunately in our visit, the Sleeping Beauty castle is still under construction but we managed to enjoy Disney Christmas Celebration.In our visit, We managed to enjoy 6 rides, 1 parade, 2 shows in our 4 hours of visit. If You're a thrill seeker, dodon't forget to enjoy the two attractions exclusive in HK Disneyland, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars and Mystic Manor. For a magical time of great fun, you can   t go wrong with Hong Kong Disneyland!",5
Great day out and it is so easy to do it in one day as it is so much smaller then other Disneyland around the world. Just be warned that currently the 8pm fireworks aredon't on due to maintenance on the castle,5
A great way to spend the day in Hong Kong. All the usual well run Disney facility's. Easy access to the venue we used the MTR all the way which was easy. Crowds were OK for mid week and winter. Cost HK619 for the day each adult. We ate in the explorers club restaurant and had an Asian curry which was OK although a bit bland to cater for all tastes. All in all e all had a fantastic day out. ,5
Awesome feeling and great experience. Really enjoyed a lot with family. Would love to visit the place again and again,5
"I   ve visited every Disney park except Shanghai and this is perhaps my favorite for a toddler. It   s a close replica of the Anaheim Disneyland but smaller without some of the big kid rides. PROs:1) For a Disney park, it   s not very crowded. I love Tokyo Disney Sea but the crowds really kill the experience there. People in Hong Kong apparently do not wake up early even when the park opens at 930am. There   s really are no lines for the first couple hours. Even during the busiest hours, the lines are moderate. 2) I love the variety of foods from all different regions. I actually looked forward to meals. 3) When we were there, they were 6 different times for the Jedi training and it was never full. 4) Admission tickets are so much cheaper than any other Disney park in the world. You can use apps like Klook to buy discount tickets and discount meals. If your children are under 7, this really is the perfect Disney experience. ",5
It is a worth it experience. Enjoyed it together with my daughter and grandchildren's. Feels like young again.,5
"Magical as expected. Fairy tale! Some great themed rides, highlight for us was the Iron Man. Go for the slightly more expensive ticket that gets you priority pass, otherwise you will need to queue quite a bit.",5
As a family we have been to Disney Florida many times. HK Disney is smaller but still has all the charm of Disney Florida. My girls had a great day and even at the age og 16 would go back againn,5
Stayed in Disney   s Hollywood hotel and spent 3 days in Disney Hong Kong with our 3 year old daughter   She had an amazing time with all the characters and princesses  Park is smaller than Florida and California but well worth a visit,5
"It was a busy night at around 1900hrs at Royal Banquet Hall on Feb 20. Long queue for ordering food and most tables were occupied. However, there was a staff called Wilson. He was absolutely professional. He smiled all the time even when he was cleaning up all tables (non stop). It made us felt warm like home. Keep up your professional work and effort. Not many staff could smile like you. Beautiful smile. ",5
"Fantastic experience. Enjoyed every step of our stay in this wonderful theme park. Thank you DisneyLand, Hongkong.",5
"No doubt people keep saying this is the happiest place on earth. To be honest, this place is quite far from the city, but dodon't worry you can reach here using MTR. I personally think the entry ticket is quite pricey, but it's all paid off with incredible attractions. It's truly magical! If you are family with kids, it's a must visit place, you can meet almost all Disney characters, and dodon't forget to capture your moments, there are so many beautiful photo spot to be captured. Suggestion: you'd better come in the morning, since the weather is not too hot and there will be more crowded in the afternoon. And if you are not in rush, be sure to see the parade or the fireworks show in the night (about 30 minutes before the closing time), that's really worth the wait, and I can say that's one of the best show I have ever seen.",5
"Much smaller than the US versions and you can easily cover the entire park in one full day. They have some things you cadon't find in the US, so, it was fun to see those.  The mystic manor and space mountain were my two favorites.",5
"Easy to get to using the MTR. Change at Sunny Bay station onto the shuttle service out to the Disneyland Resort. As you   d expect lots of Disney themed stuff going on, the train with Mickey shaped windows, hanging hand grips Mickey shaped, various statues of characters in the carafes. We went in February on a damp day. Not overly busy, with queue times between 0 and 10 minutes without any kind of priority boarding ticket. Having been to Disney Land Paris and Walt Disney World in Florida I was still hugely impressed and couldn   t stop smiling for the whole visit. A real mixture of East and West themes going on, similar in so many ways but different enough to make it still feel new. There was some building work going on around the castle and as a result the train wasn   t working though that didn   t detract from the day. Log in to the Disney Land Wi Fi and we got a HK$10 voucher. Thoroughly enjoyed Toy Story Land. The classic area of Tomorrow Land rebranded as Star Wars & Marvel. I was in Hong King as part of a short break celebrating my birthday and would thoroughly recommend taking the time to visit. You   re never too old for Disney!",5
It is definitely the happiest place on earth. Start off your day with a photo op with the balloons. Then make sure to have a photo pass you could get great photos taken by pros. You can opt to have your daughter be a princess for a day. If you are staying at the hotel it is just near the restaurant. Make sure to catch both the day and night parades.,5
Great place to visit if you are any age! Really clean and the workers do not allow line jumpers (which is good). It is a smaller park but this makes it easier to navigate and you dodon't have to keep going back to see thing you missed out on.,5
"Sure, after Anaheim, this park is small. But so much fun. We travelled with our 3 year old and it was perfect for him. We enjoyed 3 days in the park. You cadon't quite see everything in 1 day   2 is perfect and 3 just gave us the luxury of time to see everything with time to spare. We were blown away by the shows   Mickey and the Wonderous Book and The Lion King are incredible. Skip Moana if you are on a schedule. Rides aredon't that thrilling, but definitely good fun. Disney has this amazing knack for making kids rides that are fun for adults too! Toy Story Land's parachute drop is the best!! Make sure you get there at rope drop to maximise your time in the park. Food is expensive, but good enough. Choose week days for low crowds   we were there 2nd week of Jan and crowds were good. Take the train (MTR)   it's part of the experience and easy to do with some planning. Saved money by buying tickets on klook   easy to use. Often can get a discount vouchers for shops on main street between 10 and 10.30 while waiting for rope drop for rest of park. They can store your parcels and collect at end of day.Consider booking a character meal (e.g. breakfast at Disney hotel) to get those great character snaps  saves you needing to line up during that precious park time!",5
Everything are fun fun fun! But the food quality ahould be checked since uts really pricy and everyone are willing to pay,5
Great day out .....granddaughter had an absolute ball.  great main street parade and rides for the kids  as expected food n drink a tad expensive   Pleant of spots for us oldies to sit and relax,5
"Back to your childhood life, this theme park are full of imagination. It   s very attractive. Spend the the whole day, from morning to the evening. You   ll never get boring here because it shows a lot of attractions. Don   t forget to see the fireworks as a closing ceremony. ",5
Visited on January 1st. Used MTR from Kowloon which was quick and easy 2 changes. Quirky Disney carriages on last one. Caught the 4pm parade   flights of fantasy and the 8pm Paint the Night parade also the 7pm we love Mickey projection show birthday edition. The magical twilight snowfall at 6:45 was fun to see. Some areas were closed for renovation but still plenty to see plenty of queues for the rides. Overall a great visit even for big kids.,5
"Disneyland is what it is. It makes people happy, not only kids but also adults like me. The parade is something to watch out. Although my advice is be early and get priority passes, if budget permits, to enjoy your day. We have 4 passes and this made a great deal in our experience.",5
"Although this is the smallest Disneyland in the world, it doesn   t discount on the value. It definitely worth a visit!",5
"Indeed a happiest place on earth! My kids enjoyed it a lot from my eldest (10years girl) ,6 years old boy, 4 years old boy and 1 year old girl. The light show, the parade are fantastic even the food!!!! Yum!",5
"Our 3 year old daughter loves all of the Disney princesses so we had to take her to Disneyland. She had an absolute blast and probably loved the parade best because she got to see all the princesses.Unbeknownst to us we were in Hong Kong the week leading up to Chinese New Year so the city was packed but it didn   t really affect our Disney trip in any way other than it was probably much busier for a Monday than it normally would be.Disneyland Hong Kong is now where near as big as the original or Disney World Orlando, we haven   t yet been to Paris or Tokyo Disney   s so we can   t compare to them. Even though the park isn   t as big as the two in America it   s not missing anything for our 3 year old but it would be lacking in rides and activities for older kids to teens. The classics are there such as It   s a Small World. All in all it was a great trip.",5
"I have never been to any Disney Land and this was my first visit. I do not know who was more excited, my daughter or I !! The place was VERY crowded and everything was super expensive. Most of the rides were childish, but I did enjoy some. Queues were too long for some. What else to expect from such a popular destination? The evening parade was excellent!! Enjoyed myself thoroughly.",5
relive your childhood. Disney has everything that a child dreams of. so colourful vibrant and full of energy. great shows. great rides. and a nice theme park totally justifying the Disney brand,5
My daughter experienced being a princess for one whole day and this is a memory of a lifetime.  It is always a treat to visit Disneyland.,5
What a great opportunity to experience first hand the magic of Disney! After visiting other Disney parks it   s nice to visit a park with the same magic but with an Asian flair. With so many similar attractions like the ones in the US it a familiar time. ,5
"Hong Kong Disneyland isn   t as big as some of the other resorts but it has a lot packed in. The park is easy to navigate and there is always something to see or do. Character encounters take place at all times throughout the day and all over the park, often without a crazy lineup. The separate sections of the park are unique and well organized, and each gift shop as something a little different from the others. The Lion King show is amazing and very entertaining. A great place to spend a day or two if you   re in Hong Kong! ",5
"Visited with my 2 kids and Wife , we had so much Fun .we will be back for Sure.  Disneyland in Hong kong have so many activities to offer , we had great time with my family . I LOVE HONG KONG",5
It is a nice place. I like Mickey Mouse when I was a kid. It feels great when you meet the real cartoon characters. I spend a whole day and it feels refreshing and fun.,5
"I bought ticket from KLOOK and easily access to disneyland entrance. Just print out document and present to staff at the entrance.Some bad things are about the present of each cartoon, I waited to take picture with Donald Duck and Daisy but they showed up only short time. Waste my time a lot. Woody at Toy Story showed himself only in the morning. I almost cried when staff told me that Woody will show again during parade time in the evening!Long queue to wait for each machine, wait around 40 minutes to 1 hour and can play only 5 minutes!!!!!Food in Disneyland is not really good, but no choice to eat.",5
"Though HK Disneyland is only a fraction of the typical size, all ages find its fun here! No one will dislike Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy.....First time use 2 day pass and still cannot complete all major attractions! A good reason to come again!",5
"I love being in Disneyland! the ambiance, parade and everything was great! But the food taste there is so so.",5
Easy to get to via taxi (approx $130HKD from the airport). Lion King and mickey's storybook were the best shows in the park.fantastic parades and even adults feel included in the disney atmosphere! Food & drink is a little pricey.,5
"Having visited Anahiem Disneyland many years ago, we were not expecting too much at HKDL. However, we thoroughly enjoyed our vist. A highlight is the Marvel Iron Man experience (unique to HKDL) and also Mystic Manor a twist on the Haunted Mansion. It was quite busy the first day we went (we opted for the two day pass) but it was still manageable and the only issue we had was finding a table to eat at.... and the queue at the Starbucks for a coffee.",5
Great day out for the family. We had minimal ques and saw all of the park in one day. Going back for the second day to watch the shows. Easy train ride to the park.,5
"We spent our daughter's birrhday in Disneyland. As per her this is dream come true! The shows, rides, shopping is the peefect gift you can give your children. You will also realize that there is a child in you as well. Myself and wife too enjoyed the day. Gegerally we get tired walking..but that day though we walked the whole day..the intermittent rest during meals and garden was a perfect way to enjoy the whole day.Highly recommend. ",5
Disneyland make you think happy thoughts & just enjoy the day! We had too much fun that we almost diddon't realise it was almost closing time...will definitely come back here   real soon!     ,5
What else could I possibly say about going to Disneyland that hasdon't already been said. A truly magical place. A bit different from the original Disney California. Space Mountain is a combination of Space Mountain and Star Wars. Quite hysterical Hearing R2 D2in your ear while riding in the dark. The haunted house is a combination of Raiders of the Lost Ark style seating and has some of the facts of the haunted house. The jungle cruise is way better then California Disney. The whole Adventure Land is very green and Lush. The Toy Story Land is incredible. Full of lots of great rides. The Thunder Mountain is amazing and much better than California. Super easy to get there using the MTR.,5
"I was here 3 years ago and the park has a slight change. This time there is no firework at night but only parade of the disney characters. If you are looking for halal food the place is at adventure land. They serve asian food and quite resonable price. As for the ride, please go for the iron man ride and it is 3D and also go for the star war Jedi training and you fight with darth vader. For starwar fan, you must not miss this. Every ride waiting time is about 20 minutes Overall the park is well organise.",5
"Our family went there, everyone loved it although it is very small. But it is defiantly Disney and worth going to for any Disney fan. There are the popular rides, restaurants and characters in the park. You can also get a special Disney charm there from Pandora.",5
"It's great to visit Disneyland, dodon't miss the spectacular shows they have.  I wish they added few more thrill rides.",5
"We stayed at the Explorers hotel for 2 nights with 1 day access to the park in between. This was perfect for us as we have a 3 year old only and she can not go (does not want to go) on most rides.The park is so well run and manages the thoursands of people really well. It is perfectly maintained and is truly  Disneyland . Lovely music playing everywhere, plenty of staff whenever you have a question or need help, lots of food and cooldrink options. They have created this happy place. We loved it!",5
"We feel at Disneyland, like in the USA or Paris...  not that many people in winter  Fast pass are free : dodon't wait in line !  a great day, as usual !",5
"My adult son and I had a wonderful day in Dec 2018. We are bid Disney fans. We went to China to complete his around the world Disneyland parks by going to Hong Kong and Shanghai. This park like all Disney operation was clean, well laid out, great service and well worth the money. Dodon't expert a mirror of LA. Plenty of people speak English at least enough to point you in the right direction. Rides were great, food selection is extensive and night activities are well done. It is a long subway ride from Hong Kong then a pretty long walk to front gate. IMPORTANT TIP do not take in any kinds of bags or purses. Put whatever you need in your pockets. It will save you an hour getting in as security lines are very long but the line for people without them basically walk right in.",5
"Hong Kong Disneyland has the magic of the Magic Kingdom but is much smaller in size. It is therefore less crowded and easier to navigate. The downside is the quality and price of the food offered in the restaurants and hotels. There is really no other option unless one takes the subway off site It is also hard to find a willingness in the employees to accommodate special diets such as gluten free. Our granddaughter has celiacs and we asked for ice cream in a dish rather than a cone. You would think we had asked for something unbelievably difficult for them to do. They would only give us the ice cream in a cardboard paper french fry container and not in a plastic cup that they used to serve sundaes in. We found this same reluctance to make exceptions when ordering in all of the restaurants there. It was surprising to find this at a place with the Disney brand, especially considering their prices for food. The actual park tickets and hotel tickets were reasonable.",5
The resort was very nice and provide great experience for kids.Please check the weather before planning for the trip. We visit Hongkong Disneyland during the rainy season so it was raining most of the time and the resort could not perform the parade and fireworks.,5
"Being an adult and my first visit to DisneyLand, the experience was awesome. My kids were so happy to see all their favorite Disney figures. Try buying your tickets online to avoid 30 45 minutes queue even on weekdays and be early at the entrance to make most of the attractions since waiting time for attractions were 30 45 mins waiting time. A one day ticket will be enough if you are early. Look for a taxi to get to DisneyLand, they are way cheaper than UBER and off from there by 17:00 since it gets very cold around 8 9 Degrees Celsius in December",5
Had the most amazing 4days at disneyland. They made my son who has special need and in a wheelchair feel like a Prince. Made everything easy and super friendly,5
"December is really a different kind of ambiance in HK Disneyland, they have seasonal shows that will keep you going back for more.",5
"I'd been recommended to go to Disneyland in January as the crowds are less and the weather is great. We visited 2 days and both were very uncrowded, with 20 mins our longest wait for an attraction. Ideal for kids between 5 11 years old ! The night parade was a highlight.",5
"It was January 2015 when we visited HongKng on a family trip, our first international trip of course it will not be complete without visiting Disneyland, so we pack everything that we just need for the trip , so we wodon't be over baggage, hahah..just enough for the 2 nights stay, not knowing the temperature in Hong Kong that time increase up to 6 degrees and even 3 degrees when we left on our way back to PH, the jacket that we brought was not that enough to insulate us to very cold weather,, and even that time, it's the longest time that HOngKOng even experience that kind of very cold weather. One lesson learned from our travel is to always check the weather so you will be more than ready to enjoy the trip. But still we enjoyed the Disneyland tour especially my daughter who loves Minnie mouse.. Hopefully we can go back again and feel young at heart again.",5
"This is my second visit to Hong Kong Disney. I remember it being not remarkable the first time (many years ago). But, this time, I think it is worth the price of admission and a great getaway. There's several Hong Kong only rides that you have to do. Comparing to Shanghai Disney, I prefer this one a little more. We spent two days here and could have stayed a little longer. So, if you are a Disney fan, do not count this Disney as the little one. It has pure Disney heart.",5
It was nice time to go there and see the parade. But the queue to take picture with Mickey and Minie was tooooo long.,5
"My husband and I had a long layover at the airport, so we left our bags at the Left Luggage counter in Terminal 2 and caught a blue taxi to Disneyland. I   ve visited both Disney parks in the States many times, so I was excited to see the similarities and differences at the Hong Kong park.We arrived around 2:30 pm, and there was absolutely no queue. The ticket counter employee kindly informed us that there was no need to purchase fast pass tickets given the small number of guests at the park that day. And she was right! The longest queue was for 25 minutes for Winnie the Pooh. Otherwise, we walked right on to rides or waited 5   10 minutes. I have never seen a Disney park less crowded (we visited on January 9th).Like all Disneys, the park is charming and well done. There is a LOT of construction right now, including the castle and construction in Tomorrowland. There is a strong focus on photographs   so many character meet and greets and photo opportunities everywhere. Perhaps this is due to the new Instagram focused world we live in. It was fascinating to see so many dressed up guests ready for their pictures   high heels, designer dresses, lipstick, etc. This is not your normal turkey leg eating guest at the Florida park. :)The park appears to be quite small compared to CA Disneyland. We spent about 3.5 hours at the park and we were ready to go (we only rode the majority of the rides once). The roller coasters were a bit more exciting than those in the States   Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (which looks like Thunder Mountain Railroad) is much more exciting. It was also interesting to see the similarities and differences between Mystic Manor and the Haunted Mansion. There were also a few new rides and experiences that I hadn   t seen in the States.I   m glad we didn   t take a full day out of our initial visit to Hong Kong to visit Disney, but it was the perfect place to spend a long layover. ",5
"Smaller and with much less    challenging    rides than Ocean Park, HK Disneyland nevertheless really delivers.We went to HKDL only a couple of days after OP and thought it might be theme park overkill, but easily managed to keep going from before opening (we arrived 15    prior to 10.30am start) until closing after the final street parade. The family, including 17, 20 and 22 year olds, each had an awesome time. The lines were short (a Thursday in January), the weather perfectly in the Goldilocks zone, the rides fun albeit not too much of a challenge, and the vibe was ideal (how can you not get into it when fully 10 20% of the adult guests are wearing Mickey  Minnie ears or other HKDL headgear?!). I can even recommend forking out slightly extra in buying the combo food package (something I normally eschew), and definitely suggest it   s well worth purchasing online prior to going. If you can only go to one park I   d suggest HKDL on balance (cleaner, easier, fewer queues and less walking), unless you   re after more of a    local    flavour or want more thrill seeking rides. Ideally do both and make your own comparisons. Either way, enjoy the ride!",5
It   s small but still huge areas and attractions to discover in one day! Just go at opening time and during week day otherwise it will be terrible experience. We were lucky to visit mid of week days that   s why many of the attraction areas not much people on the queue! ,5
"It was so nice to escape the city for a day and visit Disneyland! It   s easy to get to (take the train from HK central to Sunny Bay, on the Tung Chung line, then change at Sunny Bay, then the purpose built Disneyland line (Mickey theming literally everywhere!) to the resort. It   s around 600$HK which is around   60 or US$75 for a one day pass, and one day is really all you need. (They do sting you a little on the locker charges though). It has all the Disney touches you   d expect at a Disney park, but it   s very small and compact. I was lucky that the day I visited crowds were low. I never queued more than 10min for anything. Hyperspace Mountain and the Iron Man ride were great, Tomorrowland is probably the best for adult guests. The mine train in Grizzly Gulch is great too. Mystic Manor will seem strange if you   re used to the Haunted Mansion, but it has its own charm. Almost everything is kid friendly and Fantasyland seems to take up a larger proportion of the park than in Florida or California. It was so quiet that some food outlets were closed, but the Skyliner Diner, Explorers and Banquet Hall had good choices and plenty of seating",5
Our experience in Disneyland was unforgettable. From we start until end we are happy all do the weather was bad we are very enjoy.,5
"My family and I had an amazing time. Yes it's smaller than the others but this it makes up for through its beauty and, dare I say it, originality without straying from the basic Disney experience. One day was not enough and I cadon't wait to see how it expands in the future.",5
"Our main attraction for visit to Hong Kong is Disneylaned. We are very happy with the trip and a day spent with Mickey and Mini!  Must see for any age, all the more for kids from 3 17 years.",5
"We bought the 2 day ticket   please try as much as possible to spend 2 days here. There is so much to do, to take in, to absorb and to enjoy. Go on every ride possible, doesnt matter if you feel too young for it, Go on it. This park is truly out of this world. Dont even miss the shows! Will entertain disney fans   young and old. Do everything touristy   mickey mouse waffles, star wars churro, minnie ice cream, pics with characters, toys and souveneirs. Most of all   take tons of pics. The memories will never leave you.",5
The main destination we visited hongkong. Dont forget to purchase tickets in by online before coming to void a long queue at the counter. Most of track are suitable for young children and their souvenier shop has pleanty offers. The night attraction also entertain us so much,5
"Disneyland Hong Kong is smaller than LA and Disneyworld parks in Florida but it made for an enjoyable day.The MTR train   which takes you right to Disneyland   is easy, fast and affordable.The only complaint from my husband is that there were no donuts!!!!! :)",5
"It was my first time going to a Disneyland and it didn   t not disappoint. We saw shows of Moana and lion king, did all the rides and we also saw the parade. It was a pricy ticket to get in but we spent a whole day in the park. It was so much fun. I would highly recommend it.",5
This is a great park which is great if you have kids under 13 years of age as it is not to big and can be done in a day if you push it. Kids and adults will love it,5
"Excellent day at Disney, queues for most rides less than 20 mins. Philarmagic amazing as always. Really nice feel to the park with far less crowding than Florida. The Iron Man experience was the highlight. Unfortunately evening parade was cancelled due to inclement weather. As in the whole of Hong Kong, public transport is cheap, efficient and very frequent.",5
"We, a family of 4, (kids 11yrs & 8yrs) went to Disneyland on Christmas Eve. We had read the reviews and just knew we had to be prepared for the crowds but I have to say, we were pleasantly surprised. We booked our tickets online through Klook, which proved effortless as we showed our QR codes to gain enterance and off we went. We were inside the main enterance just after gate opening. We had been to Disneyland California and roughly knew the rides we wanted to get on, so headed straight for them. We rode quite a few of the rides with little to no waiting time and made our way around the park easily picking rides depending on wait time. We only had the 1 day, so if you do too, I suggest you wear comfortable shoes. Yes, it   s a smaller park but there   s still kilometers to walk. Ultimately, we had a great day out and would definitely recommend a Hong Kong Disneyland visit.",5
"We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and spent 2 and a half days in the park with the kids. Hire strollers in the park for young kids at HK$120 to ease the kids walking and tiredness. A good spread of attractions and rides for old and young. Food in the Park is VERY expensive, HK$28 for a bottle of water! The Lion King and Mickey Magical Story book shows were outstanding and 20 30 minutes long to align to small kids attention spans. The Disneyland Park app came in very handy, displaying waiting times at rides and attractions as well as helping to navigate through the park.",5
"Spent a day here at the park on Christmas Eve, the experience was very magical. As always the park is filled with crowd but it did not affect our enjoyment of the day. Used the Disney app and was able to gauge approximate wait time for each ride. We came early in the day and was able to experience a good part of the park. Highly recommend the Grizzly Mine Car and Hyperspace rides. We also watched a few shows and parades. The Lion King show was particular magical, really brings back the kid in us. The evening Christmas themed shows are very memorable and well orchestrated! Definitely a magical and unique experience in HK ",5
"It was a magical experience, we had young children and they totally had so much fun. For the older children not too many things for them. The best time is at night when you get a more of a magical feel. Have too many photos, cadon't upload them all. ",5
"We showed up at the park about 45 minutes before the opening because I was worried about traffic and the entrance to the park was pretty empty. They opened the park a full half hour before the official opening! Once we were on Main Street, we were able to get photos and do a little shopping before the 10 am opening of Tomorrowland. Some rides opened early while others opened a little later. The castle was under construction, so that isdon't a good picture right now. We did the Ironman ride which was very fun and there was no line at all. It seems that since Shanghai Disney opened it isdon't as crowded at Hong Kong Disney. We did all the big rides that we wanted to do and funny enough the longest line was for Jungle Cruise. Haha! Our new favorite ride is Mystic Manor, a new and terrific version of Haunted Mansion. It is really well done! Be sure you see it! We loved the park! We made a reservation at Crystal Lotus but diddon't have a cute dim sum reservation so we were not able to get that. I wrote a separate review on that restaurant. We had done the whole park and shopped by 1 pm. As we headed out to go to the Disneyland Hotel around 1pm, the crowds coming in were insane! Apparently everyone arrives late and stays late. So we were very happy to come early and leave early. Happy that we went, and enjoyed it! We got discount tickets from Klook.com in advance. When there isdon't a crowd, it's a pretty small park and easy to manage. Go and have fun!",5
My 2nd time visiting HKG Disneyland...My children and ourselves enjoyed every moment when we were there...A place worth visiting...,5
"I visited Disneyland with my family and partner. My partner and sister were probably just young enough to get away with acting like big kids but even though we are all young adults plus my parents, we all had a great time. The rides were fantastic!Mystic Manor was a fantastic experience and appropriate for all ages, we went on this ride three times. Get to the Iron Man experience early and soak up everything that part of the park has to offer, it is an awesome section.We bought tickets that included meals and drinks and snacks and these were definitely the best value. There are heaps of options for restaurants to eat at so choose wisely where you use your voucher.If you're planning on purchasing souvenirs, take some extra cash as this can get quite expensive.The MTR Train into Disneyland is an experience in itself, it is a completely Disney train and make the experience all the more magical for the kids!",5
"It is my 3rd visit since 2005Every time there is something new, they keeps updating adding attractionsUnfortunately they stop the fire work due to some refurbish for Princess CastleIt is not big one, 2 days is all you need there, but you will enjoy itMost of the attention for all years oldSo all the family will love it",5
"We visited Disneyland Hong Kong mid dec 18, we had such a lovely time there especially the kids. it wasdon't too crowded at the entrance, actually we bought the ticket at the hotel itself and this saved us not to make the queue. if you want to explore everything better to go there in the morning itself. Great rides but queue is quite long. when you accompanied with kids you have to ensure extra money for rides toy shop pictures taken etc.... but it worth the price you pay and the nice moment.",5
"I love disney character since I was a kid, and I brought my daughter here and she loves every part of it. I love the parades, every different seasons too. It always makes me goosebump and love the music. I diddon't make any much photos with the character but my daughter did. Worth to pay for the ticket for a year pass. This place is a happiest place on earth for me!",5
"It was our first time to Disney and we had a magical time. I must say I was a bit scared about the attitude of the staff from certain reviews I read. All the staff and all the visitors (local and foreign) were very polite and we had a great time. If you are not a fan of roller coasters Disney Hong Kong is the place to go. It offers more family moments and spreads its magic through beautiful shows like Moana, The lion king, the story book. The park is not that big and can be done in 2 days. Watch out for the timing for Disney parades. Be prepared to queue up to 60 minutes for the popular rides and shows. We will surely go back to Disney Hong Kong. ",5
"Way better than the one in Shanghai, and better than Disneyland in Paris. Not very big but the lines are very long in most of the seasons , like anywhere else in Hong Kong you need to wait in a long queue to get in the ride. ",5
I   ve been to LA   this one is good too. But wait times and crowd can get to you. Getting a Two day pass helps if you have kids on tow.,5
"Bought 2 days pass and it was really worth every cent....easy access via MTR and it took roughly around 25 mins from Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station....we explored all the 7 theme parks....they do have halal food and provide prayer room for muslim....we did not take picture with the character as the queue was too long and it was not a regret as we can enjoyed ourselves with all games with queue time less than 15 mins....please go there on weekdays and not on weekend.....and for those planning to come here with children, take the 2 day pass....",5
Went there in the beginning of the month of December. Disneyland is already wonderfully decorated with Christmas lights and many performances during this season. Not too crowded too. Highly recommended.,5
"We visited just after Christmas 27th but the long line never ended . Was great to catch Mickey and Minnie at the first stop.We booked the tour with gray line tours in hongkong , Candy and Gladys were the best . You can get there by subway ( mtr). ",5
Visited Disney over the Christmas holidays.  Beautiful park and holiday decorations.  Enjoyed the lighting of the Christmas tree.  Definitely a fun day and so easy to get to by MTR.,5
Disneyland is every child dream place but it is always super crowded. This disneyland on the other hand aidon't that crowded! YAY! We went early in the morning. The morning crowd is manageable. We manage to get to go twice on some rides. Did not wait more than 30mins at any rides. Easy to walk around. Christmas lightings were up. We saw the parade and it was fun. Snacks stores everywhere. Many shows to watch. Very well organised place. Go on weekdays and it will be great! I went on Friday and it is not that crowded.,5
"Disney land is great for fun and stuff but 3 years ago, there were rides like the Buzz Lightyear based shooting and Utopia. They were quite popular rides but Disney has taken them away and replaced them with rides like Iron Man Experience. Of course, these rides are quite good but what about the old ones? They were good too. Also, the castle is currently under construction and the food is quite expensive",5
"First time here in Hong Kong Disneyland... my kids had lots of fun here especially the Mystic Manor and the Toy Story Parachute Ride... The place is huge but because it is too pack during the time we go, so we wasted lots of time is queing for rides and even for foods. There lots of stuffs in there   they evenhave Starwars and Ironman ride in there... my kids loved it... Met Mickey & Minie, Goofy, Chipmunks, Donald Duck and Ironman too... ",5
"Went to HK Disneyland last 17th December 2018 with my wife and 3.5 year old son. Even if it   s not our first time anymore, that magical happy feeling is still palpable.We arrived 10:30AM and as expected, we inevitably spent too much time in the first area around Main Street with so much to do and see, before realizing we had to move on to the other areas and attactions. My son particiularly loved the Toy Story Land area, given his familiarity with the characters there, we even went back there at night for a second time upon his request. We also spent more than an hour lining up to have a picture with Micky Mouse, but the long wait was worth it (had an easier time lining up for Chewbacca & R2D2 earlier).We had lunch and dinner at the Royal Banquet and Explorers Club, respectively. These venues offer great food and are good choices in maximizing your Klook meal coupon (HKD 149 per meal and you just pay the excess if any, plus a free ice cream or popcorn). As usual, lining up for rides was a bit of a challenge, but got easier towards the afternoon, so we just chose the ones that were suitable for our son. We took a lot of great photos all around the park and realized in hindsight that we should have gotten the 2 day pass instead of 1 day to maximize; perhaps we   ll do it next time when our son is older.By 9PM, the Parade of Disneyland characters got underway and my son, no matter how sleepy, perked up especially when he saw Lighning McQueen and Big Mack! It was an eye catching moving light show by all the performers who really looked good glowing in the dark with their LED suits and mobile stages. Then after the Parade, we went to the shops for souvenirs before we finally went back to the hotel via MTR (which fortunately operates until before midnight).Our recommendations: 1. If you really expect to spend the whole day at the park, best to avail of the Klook park entry tickets with meals for savings.2. If your overall HK itinerary can accomodate, consider the 2 day pass instead of 1 day if you really want to maximize all the attractions there without rushing so much (your kids will surely enjoy). Downloading the theme park application will also greatly help because you can conveniently see all the shows and at what time. 3. We suggest also that you print the Klook park entry tickets if possible so that it is easy to present it at the gate because trying to open the e coupons from one   s mobile phone can get confusing and will delay the queue (like what happened in our case). (Using the said e coupons, they will print out the official coupons at the gate which you will use to claim your meals snacks later on.)Hope this review helps!",5
"I love the attention to design and detail here, along with all the basic great things that happen here   had a great day seeing things and experiencing many rides. Over time I am thinking they should add another park here. This is a solid one day adventure, and two days if you incorporate some rest   I think staying at the Disney hotels would be very good for that. Having come here from California, and been to the Anaheim Disneyland several times, this might somewhat pale in comparison, but still a fun experience. Also great people watching, especially for a westerner. Snowfall at the Christmas tree was fantastic, and I still love It's a Small, Small World!",5
What to say. Everything is magical...!!!  We visited during XMas and lit brilliantly.   Everything is expensive inside.   But once in a lifetime experience...,5
"I would like to show my appreciation towards the staff at Toys Story   Parachute for their calm and professional assistance towards us when my daughter injured herself on the head when queuing on 23rd Dec. Although our visit was cut short, the staff leave a good impression for us. Thanks again.",5
"We spent a whole day at Disney during a weekday. Went in the morning, and hardly need to queue. Even in the afternoon, each queue is less than half hour at the maximum. Wonderful experience and the kids love it. The shows are professional and entertaining too. Stay for the night parade! ",5
We arrived just after 10 am which is best time to arrive and went straight to farthest rides and had lots of fun in first couple of hours. Runaway train such a great ride along with space mountain. Still can   t beat the parade in the afternoon ,5
"i like the Hong Kong disneyland and have visited it a few timesthe food particularly has the option of some wonderful chinese cuisinecoupled with the traditional disneyland classic, and this is an ideal place to soenda full day, but do remember to buy a fast track pass...",5
"Superb nice to be here, dream come true. But it was not any firework attraction because sleeping beauty castle has been renovated. Over all, this place is so good, a lot of happy inside",5
"We visited Disneyland in early November. The weather was perfect and we were very impressed with the ease in locating the rides and getting from one point to the other. The queues moved quickly on a weekday, I imagine the larger crowds visit on the weekends and holidays. Would definitely recommend and revisit.",5
Not to say it is a must visit location in HK. Not only kids but adults also enjoy to the fullest. Well maintained rides and houses lot of theme parks within it.    Its a small world    is a must watch show. Donot come back without watching the parade and fireworks,5
"We had a wonderful time. Best time to visit is during the week. Arrive when it opens  you will get about two hours of no crowds. Don   t miss Small World at night  so beautiful, wait for the clock to strike every 15 minutes. Don   t worry about language barriers, most everyone speaks English and signs are all English. ",5
"If you have never been to a Disneyland before, seize your chance: this is the most memorable experience you can have in HK.",5
"It has been a dream for me to celebrate my birthday in a very HAPPY PLACE and YES!!! It did happen...thanks to my supportive kids and husband.Well, since I am a Mickey Mouse lover I coulddon't contain my happiness when I first stepped out of that Train and felt that super cold welcoming breeze at HK Disneyland; ) Fun rides: We all really had fun with all the rides. I loved the Mystic Mano and Iron Man experienceFood: Oh I find it too expensive (downside).Weather: When you plan to visit in December, make sure to wear thick clothings because it was really cold a week ago.Price: Reasonable with all the fun rides and beautiful architecture.A MUST TRY HAPPY PLACE!!!",5
"We enjoyed our first visit to Hong Kong Disneyland. Despite having the Hurricane just a few months earlier, they did a good job to present the park in as good as condition as possible. Its a nice compact park once you get there and the attractions are quite well done...no substitute for Anaheim though.",5
"So I have now been to 4 Disneyland parks, Anaheim, Orlando, Paris and Hong Kong. Anaheim will always be my favorite, but I really enjoyed this, especially the things that aredon't at other parks such as Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain and Mickey and the Wondrous book.We were there from rope drop to close (11 hours) and did most things as there were no queues early on and only small wait times later.",5
"We're 4 person were visited to Hong Kong during December 2018.The weather is about 17  c and nice weather & no rain. We're able to follow the show time table.We bought 2 days pass to visit Hong Kong Disneyland. If we just purchase 1 day pass, we dodon't have enough time to complete all theme park's games & activities. I suggest buy 2 days pass.For these 2 days, we visited Hong Kong Disneyland till 9.00pmBeside this, i also recommended purchase Disneyland ticket and meals coupon online before visit to Disneyland. You can save time & money.Having a happy family day at Hong Kong Disneyland.",5
What a fabulous day out we had a Disney Hong Kong. We got there not long after it opened and for the most part didn   t have to queue for long to get on the rides. The merchandise shop was amazing. The parades were out of this world. The queue time did increase significantly in the late afternoon early evening but we were tired by then so we   re happy to wander around and take in the sights. We   ll definitely go back! ,5
"This park is fairly small, but we had a full and fun day. We especially enjoyed Mystic Manor and Iron Man that are different than the other Disney parks. Definitely worth seeing for any Disney fan.",5
Disney Land lives up to the expectation. For the first timers it's a place straight out of the story book. Though themed around Disney stories and characters it has many rides which is suitable for most age group. It's a place to relieve fairytale world once again. The live shows are brilliantly performed. Try visiting the place on working days. That makes it easier to see things at and enjoy rides as per own convinience.,5
Perfect theme park especially for family so many kind of choice of arena  You can see the level of thrill each arena so don   t worry.   For adults there is also a arena like Indiana jones train and good for challenge seekers,5
Kids were extremely happy..  Snacks and drink available easily..  Staffs were attentive..  Everything were good except the specific group of people (cutting queue and pushy)..,5
This isdon't as big as either American Disney's. About the same size as France and Japan. Unlike the French Disney where no English is used just French this site like all the other Disney's speak English. It's been well made and fantastic to see this island that has been reclaimed from the sea. All the engineering skills behind this fete is breathtakingly great.All the classic rides and shows and even some Chinese addictions. Staff are friendly and welcoming. Food outlets are all good and you need a few visits to take everything in unless you go when the gates open.,5
Disneyland had always been a dream to visit since a small child and it diddon't disappoint. Great place for kids (no matter what age). All the worlds had something for everyone. Be prepared to wait for some rides. Food and drink stalls everywhere with plenty of bathroom facilities.,5
"We went on a Tuesday on the first week of December. It was not crowded. We were able to go on the rides twice. (Ironman, Hyper space mountain ,RC racer, Big grizzly bear run away mine cars)My favourite ride is RC Racer and Big Grizzly Bear. The queue is less than 15 minutes. Park is well managed and staff polite. My 10 year old daughter enjoyed every time of our time there.",5
We had a fantastic time at Disneyland after a gap of 5 years. Some new rides were added and the night parade was awesome. We were initially sad that the fireworks at night was gone. But the night parade didn   t disappoint!! Don   t miss the Ironman ride which is thrilling. Even my 4.5 y.o son was able to enjoy and took it 3 times! Only complaint is almost all the main course sold in the restaurants and foodcourt there were too way overpriced as compared to normal restaurants in town. Sensible rule that selfie stick is not allowed inside. ,5
"It's small in comparison to LA,  but rides were fun,  and almost no lines!   We never spent any more than 5 minutes waiting in line.  The app is great as it lets you check line times as well.",5
Need two days to cover the entire park. Kids will love it . Go early when the park opens to avoid long queues. Throughly enjoyed the park.,5
Always stay for the final parade. Worth the while and squeeze. Grab a good spot to seat near the christmas tree and you will not be disappointed.  Shows every 15  30 mins before the final event.  Make sure you seat all the rides!,5
"Truly Disney.....  A place that showcases about all the Disney characters....  We did a lot is shopping.  One day was not enough, need at least 2 days to enjoy the whole day.  The end of the day parade was awesome.",5
Visited HK Disneyland for the 3rd time. Experienced the new Iron Man ride which was realistic. Ant Man is the new attraction slated to be released in Mar 2019. Sadly no fireworks due to the castle is undergoing upgrading works.,5
"A pain. Over expensive. Over cheesy, touristic rip off in one centre. Felt like my entire life   s savings were being squeezed out of me. Ok for the kids but even they got bored of stuff too quickly. Needs rethinking",5
The rides are almost similar with other Disneylands too. It   s ok to go one time just to see how Hong Kong Disneyland feels.,5
God I love this place.  Not as big as the Paris one but just as much fun.  The entertainment is spot on and very well organised.  Buy a fast pass though.,5
"Especially now that Shanghai Disneyland has been opened (which is much bigger) the number of people visiting Hong Kong Disneyland has dropped dramatically. Bad for Disney, but GREAT for Hong Kong people visiting Disneyland. Highly recommended   especially if you have kids!",5
"Disneyland is made basically for children but it   s really amazing for adults too. we were there in first few of October and it was not so busy time there, still 2 days are not sufficient to enjoy the whole Disneyland. We enjoyed there every second of the time we spent there. Not only your children, you will not like to come back from Disneyland. Everything is made there is to mesmerise you. Starting from the toy train to meeting the ICONIC Mickey mouse. You can   t forget a single second of your time spent here.Disneyland is divided in 7 sections. In which only two sections have rides, in which fantasyland is for young children and tomorrowland is for adults and teens.Other than rides, you will see, ironman museum with an awesome 7D show. Another 7D show is about Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.   it   s an small world    ride in a boat is simply the most charming. Well I will not say much about other attractions, but all are equally awesome. Park is super clean and well maintained. You won   t find anything which looked dirty or worn out. Staff is very supportive. When we were there HALLOWEEN was around corners, so the whole park was decorated with Halloween theme. Entry fee has just right price tag but rest everything inside is so costly. A half litre water bottle costed 35 HKD. A mickey shaped lighting balloon costs HKD 150. Logically this balloon should cost less than 15 HKD (150INR) in India. Other than attractions, you can also shop there extensively, from a basic T shirt to a great party wear gown, a simple water bottle to soft toys, everything related to Disney is there for sale. Prices are obviously so high. A basic T shirt for 2 yr child was priced for 200 HKD (2000 INR). A doll set of 24 small dolls set back me 400 HKD(4000INR). I have not visited other Disneylands, but this one is so mesmerising that your brain will refuse to forget the instances of Disneyland. Overall it   s a must visit place if you are in Hong Kong.",5
"We enjoyed our two day visit to Hong Kong Disneyland. It is on the small side compared to other Disney Parks, but it is run perfectly just like all the others. The Mystic Mansion was our favorite ride. We did not encounter any overly long lines and our time there was very memorable. We were kind of surprised that there was not a wide verity of flavored popcorn's like they have in Japan. ",5
"One day is not enough to explore the entire Hongkong Disneyland. As a family with a Kiddo it took us two days to roam the entire park. When you enter the park make sure that you have your own Disneyland Map Park with you. This way you can plan your day. Watch out for the time allotted for different shows.The shows were fantastic, the circle of life is even more fantastic.There will be long queue for every show it is an advantage to get a fast pass to escape the long line. Except for picture taking with Minnie and Mickey Mouse you have to endure the long queue because there   s no fast pass for this.The jungle river experience is a must! For water if thirsty there should be water fountain in the park just locate it in the map, anyway selfie stick is not allowed inside the park. ",5
Great place for all ages to go. Went here on a week day which was good and the place weredon't that busy thank god making it a lot easier to get on rides in no time. There was a lot of old people which was different showing no matter how old you get you can still enjoy Disney. Stayed here all day to watch parade so was worth it. Value for money Highly recommend. Booked a two way transfer save the hassle of train espically when travelling with little kids.,5
We had so much fun! This was my favorite activity we had in HK. It was a magical experience indeed. Big thanks to Klook we we're able to get the most affordable ticket for Disneyland. A day of visit is totally not enough especially on a weekend and you want to experience all the rides and take pictures with Disney characters.,5
"Rides were family friendly and disability friendly, with a mix of intense and relaxed rides, exhibitions and shows. As expected, the facade of the theme park was intricate and well maintained. Food items were also cleverly designed and incorporated Disney symbols into their design. I would highly recommend families to buy a meal combo ticket (lunch dinner 2 drinks snack) to get the most bang for your buck.Please view the following photos to experience the beauty of this Theme Park.",5
"It was a dream of mine to visit all 6 Disney parks around the world and this was the 5th one I got to check off! We had wonderful weather and it was pretty quiet during the day. We went during Halloween Time so the parades were very fun and the kids enjoyed themselves. I have never seen a Disney park offer merchandise discounts if you come before noon, so definitely take advantage of that. It is very small like the original Disneyland but is unique in it's own way. It definitely has the best Thunder Mountain of any park around the world!",5
"So we were in HK with kids and grandkids. They all love Disney but have only been to Orlando. We took them for the day here. Couple of thoughts:1. Its a very compact park, you can do it all in a day.2. Its easy to get to by taxi or train.3. While the tickets compare in price to Orlando, stuff inside is less expensive (really!).4. The VIP experience is worth it, especially if the park is busy. Be sure to get the armbands for the parade   you get the best seats possible with no jockeying.5. Weather was perfect in November, weekdays not crowded at all, weekends are crowded, especially with mainlanders since completion of high speed rail (my assessment),",5
"What a nice place to visit. Loved it, never been to any other Disney land, so this was quite the experience.  Restaurants, stalls, games, rides, shops.  Loved it.",5
"we arrived around 15 minutes before the gates were open and stayed all day until it closed. thats how much fun we had there! of course travelling with kids there are lots of breaks you'd have to take. we enjoyed the parades, and the fireworks. for muslims travellers there is a prayers room even with an ablution area! although its not labelled as musolla and it can be use by all religions but i should give credit for the their thought of having an ablution area. the prayer room is spacious and enclosed so our children could rest for a while while we prayed. most of the rides are suitable even for my 4 year old daughter although few are not. the food at the cafeteria were also delicious.",5
"Having worked at Disneyland in California for quite some time I can honestly say that Hong Kong Disneyland delivers the Magic! It   s a great place for a date, to hang out with friends or to take the whole family. It   s a Small World is incredible and has hidden characters from Disney movies throughout it! Thunder Mountain was my absolute favorite ride (for slightly older kids and adults) and the shows were great! We saw the Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book! Both amazing! The Moana show was ok but Moana didn   t sing so we left. Good food options and lots of lands to explore. Definitely smaller than Disney so if you start early you could see most of the park in a day. I turned in my day pass for an annual which was cool because they let you put your paid amount towards the full year! Oh and there is free Wi Fi throughout the park. Looking forward to heading back! ",5
"Hit all the rides in under 2 hrs. Love this place! I went mid day in October,and there were no crowds.",5
We spent 2 days here exploring the park and visiting Disneyland Hong Kong. As a Disney fan we enjoyed it and the park does a great job with the whole Disney experience. Many of the rides are similar to what you would find at Walt Disney World but we had to see for ourselves the park as we are on a quest to visit all of the Disney Parks around the world. Crowds were manageable and the weather was perfect during our visit. ,5
the best every to go to the best every the best every one shold go there it the best every the best the best,5
"As i know this Disneyland is the smallest one in the world. I had visited Tokyo one before I visited here and my experience in Tokyo wasn   t that good, thus i only had a small expectation about it. But i really enjoyed here, attraction were much better than Tokyo one. The best attraction i enjoyed is Mystic manor which i felt kind of childhood innocent. The do not miss Mini Lion King musical! It   s really worth to watch! ",5
Our visit to Disneyland was planned solely for son who   s 4 year old. That we would also have so much fun was not known The whole environment is one of gala and celebrations. The different worlds created within Disneyland make for one new experience after the other. It is humanly impossible to do all the rides and there is a fair bit of walking in between the different    lands    and quite a wait for the very popular rides. You can you the fast access to plan though. The only downer was the food options. If you are fussy you should plan your movement through Disneyland to be around the restaurant that serves food that you like. The dining options are a bit pricey for the fare offered but that   s come to be expected of all entertainment parks et al. The rides themselves are brilliant. My wife is particular got nostalgic when she did the small world ride again after 15 odd years. The Iron man ride is a do not miss ride. Couple of pieces of advise:A. Plan your route. For eg. come to the Iron man ride in the evening. Nearly no waiting around that time. Plan where you want to have lunch and decide the route for covering the various lands.B. Plan which rides and attractions you want to cover or are must do. C. Get hold of the maps once you enter and the show timings. There are different shows and the timings vary. Also the popular ones go full sometimes 30 mins in advance. D. And finally see the timing of the parades. There a few in the evening. The grand finale at the park closing time is not to be missed. It gets crowded there so try and get there to get a good path side place. Honestly it   s near impossible to cover the park in a single day. Even most good ones would take a day to cover even at a rapid pace. Two days would give you the ability to cover the park in a relaxed manner. Goes without saying a must do. ,5
"We are a Disney loving family so this was a must do for us. The park opens later than other Disney parks which worked out for us because we could actually sleep in on vacation. The park is small but absolutely lovely. I found that our only negative was some pushy guests at parade time. There were virtually no lines for most rides. Our hotel gave us fastpasses but we didn   t need a single one. Most rides were actually walk on with no wait at all. We did wait about 20 minutes for Dumbo, I think that   s it. I would have liked to have seen more offerings to meet the characters. Cast Members were friendly but not quite up to the usual Disney standard. Overall, wonderful but small park, easily done in a full day. ",5
"Love the Princess , Love the show and good place for entertainment. My kids love it.. They enjoy all the ride and love taking pictures.. There fireworks and weather is cooling.",5
Cold weather around our visit January 2018. A bit raining also. Not a best time to go at this month. But we still go because the show must go on. Its a dream come true for the kids. But it will the best if your kids around 8years old and up for their have some height limit on the rides.,5
"Make sure to download the Disneyland HK App for easy MAP access and to know all the show schedules of the day. It was very helpful for us that's why we were able to pace and schedule our whole day in Disneyland. :) MTR to Disney was very easy as well! All the food inside were quite expensive even the drinks, so I suggest that you bring your own refillable tumbler so you have water while walking the whole day. Must watch The Lion King show and the Festival Parade!",5
"Such a beautiful place that one can keep going again and again. Brought our kids there for their school break. A lot of changes, with new attractions, however, we came at the wrong time where a lot of constructions and castle closure which was a put off. The language use... hmmm Mickey talking in Cantonese was a put off. Should stick to English instead. ",5
"Spent a weekend in HK for our daughter   s gymnastics meet. We decided to reward her afterwards with a family day in Disneyland. It was great fun especially since we joined other friends there from the event. Our daughters cartwheeled their way into the entrance. Crowd wasn   t so bad but the castle was under repair so no traditional fireworks to cap the night. Instead, there was light show parade which wasn   t half bad! ",5
"It was awesome! We went on a Monday and got to see every show and ride every ride that we wanted. Wait times were minimal and crowds were sparse. I would say that my one poor experience came from the cast member responsible for maintaining the line for the Pluto meet and greet. He was quite rude and yelled at children repeatedly, then yelled at parents. A child and parent who got out of line were allowed to rejoin the line ahead of me and my son. This was also frustrating as we had been waiting for quite some time to see Pluto. I diddon't find it overly expensive, it's Disney!",5
"I read alot of reviews on this and was a bit concerned that it wasnt worth going but this was an absolutely amazing experience. I will note that i am a huge disney fan and that this was my first disney part visit.We arrived early and seemed to be at the start of tourist season. It was busy but not too bad. We didnt stand in a line for longer than 20 minutes. When the park opens you are first only allowed in the shopping area, obviously so you can buy stuff and they can make money but there is sooooo much to choose from.We went on most of the rides and went on them twice   once at day and once at night.We bought the tickets and food vouchers on Klook and this was a great savings and also really worth it.The rides were really fun and the overall ride experience was amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed the mine cart in the grizzly grouch area, as well as the star wars ride and the toy story horse shoe.The parades   we watched both the day and night parades   were absolutely spectacular and definitely worth going to   just a tip though is to find a spot about 30 minutes before the parade is due to start as there are alot of people.Also try and find a spot towards the end of main street USA where the road splits to the different parks as the last few floats and characters dont go all the way to the bottom of the road.We also managed to watch two of the shows. The Lion King which was amazing and then Moana which was great but the Lion King was definitely a way better experience.The only let down was that the characters are not walking around so they were only available for short time slots and for a limited amount of people so you had to try and plan your day around this.",5
"Disneyland is a must when you visit Hong Kong, it is located near the airport which is out of the way depending on where you are staying.We were staying the New Territories (Sha Tin), fortunately there is a bus that goes to Lantau Island Plaza where we then change to Disneyland bus (R8) which take us straight to Disneyland, all in all taking around 40 mins to get there.There are many ways to get the Disneyland the MTR, the blue coloured taxis or bus, the bus is definitely the cheaper option costing under $50 HKD per person.Entry to the park is quite expensive costing $699 per adult and $515 per child (as of October 2018) in total costing   210 GBP.Within the park there are many various rides that suits all ages, from the infamous Hyperspace Mountain to the jungle cruise.The eatery within the park are reasonable priced. We visited the park during a weekday and even though there was a lot of people in the park, the queues for rides were very good, averaging around a 10 minute wait.The parade is not to be missed and was very well put together. During our visit in October 2018 there was construction work being carried out on the Princess Castle, so there was no firework display in the evening. Overall, we have a fantastic day and out young children loved their time in Disneyland Hong Kong and it was definitely worth the visit. Tips:Visit during a weekday.Pre book buy tickets to see if there are any deals packages.",5
"Crowded but worth it.  I loved the light show at night, Christmas music was played and snowflakes flew in the air. At that instant, I felt the joy of Christmas.",5
Loved this Disney park.  It was quieter than any of the others I've been to and retains the charm of the original Disney parks in America before they started modernising them.  Great day and my favourite of the four Asian Disney parks.,5
"To be honest, we were expecting this to be the worst Disney park we   ve been to because it   s so small, but it was brilliant. It is small, but that   s part of the charm. It has all the classics you expect but with none of the stress and hassle you get in other parks.",5
"Hong Kong Disneyland is off the beaten track destination for everyone's desire. This site is full of new creation, nice atmosphere and beautiful landscape to explore while visiting here. The place has also captured our attentions and felt absorbed in.",5
"I went with my girlfriend in Hong Kong, and she had a great time! Needless to say, she lived her childhood dream all in one day. You all should've seen the looks on her face during the whole day we spent in HK Disneyland. Getting to Disneyland from Central and the way back was easy and convenient, given that Hong Kong's MTR is one of the world's most efficient metro system.",5
"An absolute must see and a perfect way to spend a beautiful day, the park along with all the shows is stunning. Very well organised and plenty of friendly staff to help you around .Food is good and they have a large variety of restaurants and caffe . There is a locker service where you can leave your belongings for the day , is secured and you can access it anytime, there is also a luggage valet service if you want to leave a case with wheels.We didn   t spend much above the ticket price as all rides are included.",5
"We   ve been to every Disney Park in the world, and this one may be our favorite. In our 4 visits to HKDL, we have loved the beautiful surroundings, the short or nonexistent lines, and the manicured walk from the hotels to the park. The musical productions here are terrific (it   s currently Mickey and the Wondrous Book), and there are other unique attractions as well: Mystic Manor (which is NOT a Haunted Mansion) and Grizzly Gulch. There are also some minor noteworthy features: this park   s Small World was the first to include Disney characters, and its Jungle River Cruise has a surprise ending. The castle is surprisingly small, but it is currently undergoing construction that will enlarge it.",5
"We had a great day out at Disneyland. We went on a Thursday in October so it wasdon't busy at all. Longest wait for anything was about 15 minutes. Download the App and it tells you the current wait times all over the park.It is much smaller than Disneylands but that was good for us with 2 kids under 7, it was easy to walk around the whole park a few times, and most of the rides were good for the younger kids. It might be lacking if you're after big thrills. The food was generally ok and not at astonishing prices.As it got dark we went back and had a second ride on all the things we wanted and some we had missed earlier in the day. All 3 parades we good and as it wasdon't too busy everyone was able to see fine. Highlights: The Lion King show (dodon't miss this and it's a good airconditioned break), Mystic Manor and the Jungle River cruise (make sure you go after dark, it's much better). As people have mentioned HK Disneyland doesdon't really have the characters just walking around the Park like you find in other Disneylands, so if getting pics with them is your thing you will have to line up at specific locations and times. The train out there was good, and wasdon't even packed after closing time (we walked slowly back to the station). Easily managed to stay the whole day, opening to close, and would definitely go back next time we are in HK. If you need to decide between Disneyland and Ocean Park, pick Disneyland if your travelling with younger kids.",5
"We simply had the best day at Hong Kong Disney. I had read some negative reviews but they proved to be untrue. We visited in mid November and the park was decorated for Christmas which made it even more special. It was my wife and I and our 20 year old daughter who went. The rides were excellent. The lines were pretty short (we were there on a Monday), the longest we waited was 20 minutes but some rides we just walked on. The shows and parades were pretty good. Except the snow show at 6:15pm. Not worth waiting around for. The park was clean, the toilets were clean, plenty of food stores (overpriced but that goes with the territory)Best rides were Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch and the Iron Man one in Tomorrow Land. My daughter said the only negative was that there were no thrill rides like a major roller coaster. Getting there via the MTR was super easy. If you bought the tickets online you have to go to Guest Relations on the left of the main gate to pick up your actual tickets. If this has been helpful please give me a helpful vote. ",5
"Great park. We easily rode did everything we wanted in one day and went back for a few hours during mid day for a second day for our favorite rides and shows. Mickey and the Wonderous Book is my all time favorite Disney show. I just wish the castle wasdon't under construction, but I'll just have to go to see the new one when completed. ",5
"Ive been lucky enough to visit Hong Kong Disneyland a number of times since it first opened, and each time I've been there there's something new and exciting. Whether with children or just adults, Hong Kong Disneyland is a great day out for anyone. Who doesdon't want to have their picture taken with Mickey Mouse??? It's a short train ride from any part of Hong Kong, and there are great food outlets and entertainment for all the family.",5
"Disneyland. Need I say more? The most wonderful place in the world!Hong Kong Disney is a lot smaller than the others I   ve been to but of course there   s plenty to do. I   ve been twice, but most recently I got there as it opened which was great    there were no queues for any of the rides so we whizzed round quite quickly.I love the shows they put on there! The Lion King one is great so make sure you get to see that! You can book day tickets online for HKD 619     62! 100% worth it! It   s quite close to the airport and has luggage storage if you want to fill the day before you leave. It   s about 30 mins from Hong Kong Central station and very easy to get there. The train has Mickey shaped windows and handles!!! So cute!You can read more about it in the blog on my page. Please check it out!",5
"Of course anything Disney is magic! Our experience at Hong Kong Disneyland was a memorable one.. having been to the parks in California, USA, we found Hong Kong to be much quieter and the longest we ever lined up for a ride would have been 10 15 minutes   and this was only for a couple of rides! We did stay at the nearby Disneyland Hotel, and this included some  priority passes  to certain attractions.The rides were all fun, with all but a couple having height restrictions that our 4 year old just missed out on! The only disappointment was the BIG lines to see the characters   and this resulted in us missing out on a photo with most of them! Even with a full 2 days here.. The lines close, well before they even officially arrive, and with only a couple of appearances each day, it is so limited! There should be more characters dressed up, and they should be out & about ALL day   not just an hour here & there... there could be 2 of each scattered throughout the park even.. and this would make everyones visit just that bit more magical!! The chaos in the gift shops is crazy, the best time to shop is whilst the parades are happening just outside!! I would skip back in a heartbeat and could quite easily spend another 2 days here! ",5
Went with a group of Disneyfied adults on a week day. The park was decked out for Halloween   very nice. There were no crowds so we could go on every ride without ANY long waits. Liked the crowd  mellow & happy.,5
"Fantastic Experience. This is my Second time visiting Hongkong disneyland and it never fails to amaze me.The best part is the Iron Man experience for me. Superb. Also, the Castle is under renovation when we went there so We cannot have a photo of it. better go to these place as early as 930 am. Get a Map at their City Hall Area . Get your fast Pass to save your time on queing.",5
"I love Disneyland. Typically laid out in all the worlds. Great rides for young and old, lots of food and drink stations around the park. Most rides open the day I went. Plenty of parades and music happening most of the day. Always a fun day.",5
"No matter what age or marital status, Disney is always my favorite place. The shows and rides are fantastic, I keep coming back. Definitely for all ages!",5
"Disneyland....a childhood dream for every kid and finally it comes true.. i mean it when i say, that i was in heaven...it is the best place to be and the best time considering we went on Halloween.... i wish i could go there every day...We did quite some research before we went there, so we had a list of rides that we wanted to sit on and lands to visit. We found the Disneyland app, very helpful   in terms of the events for the day. The plan should always be to finish the to do items that you have on checklist and then have plenty of time to visit every land.Must do rides: Grizzy Mountain runaway mine cars, Hyperspace mountain,4D experience in Iron Man experience, RC race car, Mystique ManorThe app shows you the timings of the events, so we could attend all the shows and parades. Be ready to walk a lot, and wait a lot in queues if you want to take pictures with Mickey and Minnie.Most of the rides have fast track option with no additional cost. Every land has themed restaurants. Since it was halloween, everyone was dressed up in costumes, we were handed candies as a part of trick or treat, we visited the haunted house and finally watch the really cool   Villains night out parade.A definite visit to the place..where you feel anything and everything is possible. It is truly magical.",5
We were told that as we had been to the original parks in the USA we would be disappointed with HK Disneyland   but we were certainly not! We diddon't go there expecting to see what we saw in the USA as each park has its own local charm. We enjoyed our day and loved the parades! Only issue is that there should be more taxis readily available when leaving the park as we had to wait for a while.,5
"Amazing for kids and teenager.... Takes all day, because a lot of venue you must visited. i am for the first time at disneyland",5
"Walking up to the entrance of Disneyland, it   s hard not to feel your inner kid coming out and feel super excited! It   s magical right from the beginning with beautiful statues of Mickey Mouse and his friends in a big water fountain. We arrived in the morning as soon as the park was opening and went through the ticket queue fairly fast. But the crowd was growing much quicker than expected, and later on we found out we chose a public holiday weekend so the crowds were much bigger than usual! We would advise to research this before you plan your trip because it definitely tested our patience and dampened our spirits at times. Because of this, the queues for every single ride were anywhere from 30 minutes several hours long, and it was a very hot day. We anticipated having to line up at Disneyland but the public holiday really made things 10 times slower. But when your at Disneyland, not even that can get you down, it   s just so magical and happy! One ride in each    land    had the option for you to scan your ticket and it would give you another ticket with a time frame on it, so you   re able to go and do other things then come back to skip the line within that time frame. We were then able to go on all the main rides and explore each land. There were so many amazingly fun rides to experience, as well as photo meet and greets with favourite Disney characters such as Eeyore, r2d2, iron man and more. Tarzan   s treehouse is just brilliant, toy story land is every big kids dream and we were lucky enough to see Disneyland at Halloween time, which was spectacular! We spent all day there and upon reflection, would   ve planned to spend 2 full days, regardless of the public holiday. Disneyland truly is what you imagine it to be and more! It allows you to be a child and just have fun. Would definitely go back : ) ",5
"I went there with the family with 2 kids in tow on Halloween weekend for a 2 day pass. It   s my second time to visit HK DL and this second visit was surely better than the before. I tried more attractions. The kids most definitely enjoyed it the most. They met Mickey Mouse, Goofy, watched the Flights of Fantasy parade, Mickey Projection Show and the Villain Parade, Journey to Halloween were halloween features. The snacks were great too! Popscicles, waffles, eggette, etc. The staff were giving away lota of free stickers to the kids. And there was a lot of trick or treatin for mickey mouse marshmallows and gummy candies!!! Everything was great as expected. Disneyland HK never disappoints! As an adult, i appreciate places like these by their toilets! Hehehe. No smell, spotless clean, aaaaaand wait for it, free unlimited toilet seat covers!!!!! Sorry for that brief shallow happy episode because where i come from, no toilet seat covers are free! Anyhoo, HKDL is recommended for all ages!!! It   s a must visit when in HK. Most definitely!",5
"  Huge area and really beautiful  With Disney Train, easy to go to location via MTR  lots of attractions and activities (Rides, plays, parade)  with App thats really helpful  also with brochures at entrance for maps and schedules  delicious food and snack",5
"This is the best time during our stay in Hong Kong. I had booked 2 days ticket via Klook. You get discount when you book via Klook. The place opens at 10:30 am. Most time you will spend at Fantasyland. Here you have maximum number of rides and shows. Also many characters would visit you. Because you have so many things to cover so plan your route accordingly. As we had 2 day pass, we went around in liesure. Lion king show was mind blowing. So was Mickey and the adventure book. we had a great time. The night parade was amazing. Plan to sit atleast 30 mins ahead of the schedule so that you get the best place to watch any show. The cheapest way to reach is via MTR and it takes approx 45 mins. ",5
"This is amazing loved every second of it ,  The queues to meet the characters can be a bit long especially in the heat but well worth it if you can keep your child shaded and entertained,",5
Nothing short of amazing! Although during our visit there was a private event so they had to close 4 attractions which I felt was a bit unfair. They could   ve given a discount for visitors for that day or made an announcement prior.,5
"Happiest place on earth, may have to agree  We had a ball   Go with your mind set at kiddy level and you will have a ball",5
"We have been to Hong Kong and Disneyland on a number of occasions. This time however we had taken the Grandchildren with us, both boys aged 6 and 8. They had a wonderful day and during the afternoon Halloween Parade they were invited to take part, however they decided to decline as they are a bit shy. The parade was very well performed. Disneyland Hong Kong can at a push be done in a day. It is one of the smaller Disney global sites, however, what it lacks in size is made up for in atmosphere. It   s a great park and well worth a visit during your stay in Hong Kong. The MTR (mass transit railway) is the easiest way to get to the site. The journey takes about 40 mins from Mongkok.",5
"English language travel books and blogs like to compare Hong Kong Disneyland to Ocean Park Hong Kong. Opened in 1977, Ocean Park often gets the nod over its 13 year old rival with the more scenic location, being three times larger, having a wider range of attractions and thrill rides, and for entertaining guests with shows starring not costumed characters, but live land and marine animals. Two categories in which Ocean Park is all wet, however, are food     ho hum carnival type fare versus Disneyland   s higher quality, wider ranging dining experiences     and, the deciding factor for me, what is known as    Disney Magic.    There   s something different about being at a Disney park     the hospitality, memory making, cleanliness, positive attitude, and characters and stories beloved for generations. It   s like coming home whether you went as a child or not. HKD is the smallest of all Disney parks, but that doesn   t make a visit any less magical and unique. Its version of the Haunted Mansion is Mystic Manor, which whisks guests through the Victorian home of world traveler Lord Henry Mystic. The mansion comes alive after Henry   s mischievous pet monkey Albert opens a music box that unleashes mayhem and enchantment. Another HKD exclusive is the exciting year old Iron Man Experience; imagine Stark Enterprises assuming sponsorship of Star Tours. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, HKD   s version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, has a section where riders go backwards. Just for fun, enter the    Cantonese    or    Mandarin    line at the Jungle Cruise to hear those tired, corny jokes in a different language. OK, so there   s no Matterhorn or Pirates of the Caribbean, but when was the last time you ate smoked duck legs and curry fish balls in Anaheim or Orlando?",5
You cadon't go wrong with disneyland when your with kids. I suggest to go here early to avoid long lines. During the afternoon lines for the rides starts to build up. The waiting time is between 20 40mins unlike in the morning its just between 5 10mins.,5
"Had a really memorable time here. Best food I've had at a theme park, hands down. Night parade was beautiful. Cadon't wait to come back!",5
The main trip highlight is disneyland. Loads of fun and loads of excitement. We had a super time here.,5
"Been to Anaheim, Orlando and now Hong Kong and not disappointed at all! Another fantastic environment by the Disney team! While nowhere near the expanse of Orlando or even Anaheim, HK Disneyland still provides a most enjoyable experience for all ages. 3 adults and 2 small (5 & 3 yrs) children in our party. Dumbo still a favorite for all as well as the Ironman Experience (only in HKD). Ironman was a unanimous choice by all to be repeated before leaving the park at closing!",5
"Truly, it is happiest place on earth. Best place to spend with your family and friends. Rides are fun for all ages and queues are quick. It is smaller as compared to Anaheim's Disneyland, but there are many, good attractions for each family member to enjoy. Facilities are family friendly. A few local staff manning the parade can be friendlier and warmer. After all, they represent Disney.",5
"Just spent 6 hours at Disneyland with our 8 year old granddaughter! This is not the first time we've been there with her, but we can see at this age, her height qualifies her for more exciting rides! Some rides were reserved for her an her grandfather, but others, we could all enjoy! Our trip was the latter part of October, so apparently it had cooled down a bit. Comfortable but warm. It is a very fun place for all!!",5
"So Disneyland is Disneyland....Lots of characters to visit, lots of rides and experiences to explore, queues and overpriced food. However, you are going to Disneyland, this is what its all about.The number 1 tip we can provide you is GO EARLY. The attendance at the part litterally triples around 3pm. Between 10:30am and 2pm there are nearly NO queues at any entertainment   rides then it hits 2 3pm and the most popular rides have 30 50 mins waits. You CAN bring in water (I took in three bottles and showed them when entering and was let straight through) and a small amount of food, just dodon't bring a picnic. Sure the food is overpriced and substandard but this IS expected in theme parks. Just accept that...Head early, bring water, and let your imagination run away with the fun of Disneyland...",5
What draws us to Disneyland is the exhuberance and excitement that   s created by both children and their parents while they enjoy and entertain. Hong Kong Disneyland is no different and yet different from other Disneyland   s as they go. There are unique rides and few new ones like the one we saw in the Iron Man Experience. It has been added after the acquisition of Marvel Universe by Disney.,5
"Well it took me 62 years but finally i got to Disneyland and loved every second of it. I know H.K. Disney is the smallest of the 6 but it is great, got through it in one fun filled day virtually no waiting on all the rides as we went on a Friday. My wife enjoyed the jungle ride and the cup and saucers as we always seen it on T.V. Hyper space, the gulch , the mansion all the 3D stuff were excellent , I would imagine if your taking children and want to do it all a 2 day pass would be the go and it's not a great deal dearer .",5
We loved Hong Kong Disneyland!  There is just something so special and magical about Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland captures this well. You only need to see the smiles on the faces during the parade to know this is one great place.,5
"I spent a magical day At Hong Kong Disneyland with my brother and his family. I had reservations about Hong Kong Disney as I have been to the other Disney parks and this one is obviously much smaller than what I am used to in the context of the magic of Disney!However, whilst small, it   s perfectly formed and there is still huge variety of things to do across the park. I would say it   s particularly geared for smaller children as the size suits their ability to get around the park and do everything. Highlights were the Flights of Fantasy parade (magical), toy story land (in particular the parachute ride) and It   s a Small World (my all time favourite!). It   s everything you would expect from Disney in a really nice bite sized dose which makes it perfect for a 1 day visit. ",5
We went here for the day it was a great day for all adults and kids alike. It has good mixture of rides and shows everyone enjoyed the day.,5
"Reading online I felt there was a huge feeling of inferiority to this Disneyland compared to its American counterparts but I can honestly say I had a great time! It may look small on a map but I would say it felt about the same size as Disneyland California. There is so much to see and do our only downtime was sitting down to eat twice the whole day. I would say if you are a hardcore Disney fan it can be a two day park but you can definitely do it justice in one.My favourite rides (in order) were Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Car, Hyperspace Mountain and The Iron Man Experiece**. We headed straight to The Iron Man Experience and Mystic Manor when we first got to the park and faced minimal wait time   When we returned later on in the day queues had built up but we stayed onsite at the Hollywood Hotel which provided us with Fast Passes which came in very handy in these instances.** Shout out to It   s A Small World and the Dumbo rides that hold a special place in my heart too**The shows at Hong Kong Disney were amazing too   Check out Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wonderous Book and Mickeys PhilharMagic. I can   t remember enjoying shows at other Disney Parks as much. The We Love Mickey show was cool too and didn   t involve having to fight with crowds for a space down Main Street   the show is literally projected into the surrounding buildings so you can stand wherever you like. At the end of the day there was a Villains Night Out show keeping with the Halloween theme and involving popular villains from your favourite Disney movies. It was a lot of fun but mostly in Chinese so apart from a whole lot of cackling I wasn   t really too sure what was going on! (Shout out to Cruella who was giving it 100!!!)As well as the shows there were parades to see too. Mickeys Flight of Fancy was the best. Again, keeping with Halloween, there was a Halloween Street Party down Main Street which was fun but could have been avoided. The Hong Kong Disneyland app came in very useful when planning my day at Disney, providing show parade times and where they were located. As you can probably tell I am a Disney fan. I honestly had a great time and feel like people are a tad harsh in relation to this park (I was constant told not to expect too much). My only disappointments are:1) the size of Sleeping Beauty castle and the fact there was a lot of construction going on around it (   pardon our dust we are creating magic   ). As my partner pointed out the 15ft fence probably made the already small castle look even smaller but I am sure once they are finished it will look amazing and I will definitely be back to see for myself! 2) Despite the Disney Corporation priding themselves in magic and customer service I was a disappointed to not see this fully reflected in this park. Overall customer service was lacking in Hong Kong as a whole and I understand culturally it is a different world, but I was constantly disappointed in the rudeness I experienced during my trip and think it something that needs to be worked on at this park in order to keep in with the Disney magic.",5
"We enjoyed our day out in Disneyland, not like before that over crowed ( weekend  dilemma ). We can pleased our over the rides without long queues.",5
I had awesome fun at Disneyland they had a fun Halloween show with Mickey Minnie goofy dancing. Had A great fun day there.,5
"If you are in Hong Kong and are even slightly interested in anything Disney including the  new  franchises, then a visit Disneyland is a must. All the classics are there, including a trip on  It's a Small World , while the Pixar, Star Wars and Iron Man displays bring Disney up to date. There is literally something for everyone at the Hong Kong Disneyland   even the journey on the Disney MTR is fun.",5
It's close to the airport and small enough to do on a stop over.  Great for young families   it's not that busy and you can go to the toy story land.,5
"a great place to be, reat rides, great ambiencea lot to walk though but it is very enjoyable, dodon't miss the mickey parade at night around 7 and the light show at the castle later, both of these attractions are very well organised and very well played.",5
"It's possible to go around all the ride in one day if you plan to go to Hong Kong Disneyland, and the best thing about Disneyland is the fireworks and the parade.",5
"Good place to relax for adults and children, will take a whole day to view all the features inside the park.",5
"I just loved this , if you have a ten hour delay at Hong Kong airport then do this.amazing day theDisney gardens and rides are amazing.be sure to have a Mickey Mouse waffle too. It   s an awesome day and the question are not too long ",5
"Our first Disneyland and there were rides for 10 and 12 year old. Entry took 50 minutes when arriving at 10, but straight through the second day at 4!",5
I   d read all the reviews before going and a lot were disappointed about it being small. Went with an open mind as we   ve been to both Disneyland and Disney world in the USA before. We had a lovely day as adults. Got around the park in a day. Most rides were between a 15 30 wait in line which was manageable. We didn   t watch any of the shows except the Halloween street parade at 4:30pm (which didn   t disappoint) and didn   t line up for character photos so the Day was very smooth. Has all the charm of the original park and well worth the visit for a Disney fan.,5
"Disneyland in Hong Kong is a Fabulous opportunity for Australasia to experience the joys of a Magical World away from bars, clubs and casinos! It is where Adults can be kids and kids to be thrilled by the magic. Firstly, if you are not staying in the Disney resort it is wise to buy your tickets online, also include your meal in the ticket as it is easier and cheaper. The package also includes a drink or ice cream AND a $50 voucher to spend at the Disney shop.We arrived close to opening time to beat the crowds but also remember the grand parade and fireworks are late evening, so check the show times and choose your arrival time accordingly. There is only one train connection in and out of Disneyland, dodon't stress about missing it as it runs every 10 mins etc. Entry during non peak season is quick, but beware bags are checked and no picnics, outside food or big drinks allowed.Once, inside the FUN begins, grab a map, review show times then run amok. If you are in a big family group like we were, separate and meet up when you  bump  into each other or at a arranged time as not every ride is suitable for everyone.The outer restaurants are quieter and are like food markets, make sure you take your voucher to validate if applicable.Queues for rides in October wasdon't to long a wait between 5   25 mins, depends on type of ride as the more fast action rides went quicker as little kids could not go on them. The Dumbo ride was the best, simple BUT Fun. If you want the adrenalin rush then the Star Wars ride and the old Cabin Rail ride will do the trick. Skip the Halloween walk through journey, it's in Chinese with only one character speaking English. The  It's a Small World After All  ride in Fantasyland is so CUTE!Time flies and in no time the day ends as everyone is tired and themed park out.tyThanks to the Security staff who let our devastated 6 year old nephew re enter at the exit gate with his parents to search for his Disney cap he had left behind while posing for a photo just before exiting. By magic, no one picked it up and it was found where he had left it.",5
"Our kid enjoy the place much,the hotel we stayed offer us discounted ticket,the place are easy to reach by metro.",5
Disneyland is must go place when you come to Hongkong. Since i was a kid i always dream to coming to Disneyland! It was an amazing experience! There are so many attraction there and you must take picture with Disney's character at the main street. It's a must! Wait until night and you can see Disney's parade at main street too. Food is okay but can be a lil bit expensive. But hey come on! Enjoy your dream holiday :D ,5
"It was everybody's child dream to come to this beautiful place...And its true!!truly incredible!!!Not only kid's can enjoy to visit here but all adult's with young heart will surely love the place!!!My nephews, niece and even my Mom love the place!!!Meeting Mickey and friends during the parade was truly a dream come true!!!Looking forward to visit this place again... ",5
I have been to Disneyland in Los Angeles so I can only compare the Hong Kong site to the original. I enjoyed this Disneyland very much. The staff were always friendly and helpful. We had a mix up with our pre bought tickets and they went out of their way to help us resolve the issue even offering us express passes to some of the popular rides. Having been there in October they had a Halloween theme throughout the park and line ups to rides were not long as it was out of the holiday season for Hong Kong residents. They were giving away lots of stickers and lollies in the Halloween themed garden where kids could make up small baskets to go trick or treating. This was all free. Food is standard theme park menu items. We had burgers and fries which was decent enough.The theme park is near the airport direction and it cost us approx $50AUD each way from our hotel in Mong Kok via Uber (we had 6 people and needed a large van).There is also complimentary wi fi throughout the park.Its a long and tiring day when you are there from 10:30am until 8:30pm at night but it is worth it to see all the parades as well as the rides and features. I recommend to attend over two days as we diddon't get to see all the themed sections in the first day. The kids loved it and so did us adults.,5
"We visited hong kong for our honeymoon December was perfect we had a really good time ... found the cutest merchandise at Disneyland stores picked so many tshirts and kitchen stuff, accessories etcMust visit loved all the rides too and the food tried red velvet pop corn too.For food and travel updates daily follow @ foodieandmoody on instagram thank you.",5
"By comparison to LA , this Disneyland is not so intimidating and bug. We spent 2 days and still did not see everything. The ride lines are not long, didn   t use our priority passes. The staff are friendly and with a 6 year old it was perfect. ",5
"A day in Disneyland has always been magical. When me and my friends reached Sunny Bay Station to get to Disneyland Resort, we were greeted by a Disney themed train with Mickey shaped windows. Do bring along an umbrella or poncho just in case it rains and there is no shelter. Whether you are with a family of friends, you will enjoy the experience. Most rides cater to children but there are roller coasters and thrilling rides at Toy Story section. There is 2 halal certified store at Mainstreet Market and the Explorer's Club for muslim travellers. Do look out for the parades as kids will love it. Wear comfortable outfit and shoes if possible as the place is damn huge and require lots of walking. Highly recommended for all ages.",5
"we enjoyed every minute of this great experience ,we took the small train all around the Disneyland ,then we took a small boat to see the wonderful animals lived there and although they are unreal one ,they look very real with the emotions and voices they act .there were also a very nice show with all the famous characters of Disney ..worth to visit",5
"My first trip to Disneyland ever. Definitely wont be my last. Staff are friendly to help with our inquiries and despite the long wait for the rides, they are definitely enjoyable.Will definitely revisit in the future. Thabks for bringing the kid in me once again.",5
"Everyone dream of visiting Disneyland, once in their life. One of the reason of visiting Hong Kong was this only. Starting from Disneyland train till the last ride, enjoyed a lot. If there would have been some more rides and timings would have extended till 9 PM, it would have been AWESOME.",5
"We took our 1 year old to visit Hong Kong Disneyland as a birthday treat. We went the day after the clean up from the typhoon   I was very impressed with their efficiency! We had a fabulous time. The baby had fun on  it's a small world after all  boat ride, the  Winnie the Pooh  train ride and the  Incredibles  ride. It was easy to get around with a stroller (compared to the rest of HK which isdon't stroller friendly), had decent food options for babies at the cafe, decent baby change and breastfeeding facilities were available and the staff were very friendly. We enjoyed the fact that it wasdon't as large as the other Disneylands so it was easier to see all the entertainment. As we were leaving for the night, they put on a special Halloween parade. It is easy to get to HK Disneyland via the metro but you do need to change at least once on the metro if your hotel is on another HK island e.g. Kowloon. It is also close to the cable car ride at Ngong Ping so if there is time and energy, I would recommend doing the two together on the day. See Ngong Ping first and take the cable car for a great view of the beauty of HK and then take the metro to Disneyland and enjoy the rest of the day and evening there.",5
"Smaller than the original Disneyland in Anaheim, but even with its compact nature it packs a day full of fun. We got super lucky on our day, it wasn   t so crowded so my friends and I managed to do every single thing, except the little kids rides. There are a few unique rides and HKD, like mystic manor and the new iron man ride, which will give you bragging rights as they aren   t at other parks, but then standards like a Star Wars version of space mountain, it   s a small world, and my personal favorite the jungle cruise. As to shows, go see them all. They were so much fun and amazing. Even some shows are in multiple languages at once, it only adds to the charm. Lion King was my favorite. And the parades, especially the Villains parade at night was really fantastic. The food was also good and not unreasonable considering HK prices. And if you want special stickers be sure to ask cat members for help or questions and then you may get one. I got three. Over all amazing fun day. ",5
Traveled with our friends from Sydney and booked 2 separate special tours to run concurrently The tour guides were superb with childrenHighly recommended to book a tour if you want to cover selected attractions within a day.The food could be better though given the price Otherwise great place to visit,5
"Just like any other wonderful and enchanting Disneyland parks, facilities perfectly kept, high quality service and entertainment, we visit a week after one of the biggest typhoon ever hit the area, and besides the amount of trees they lost or got damaged everything else was up and running, with the exception of some areas around the castle that was close for repairs or improvements. Food was great, very large serves, food vouchers with our entrance tickets were a good option and even if you choose a meal over the limit of the voucher value, you can paid the difference. The park itself might be smaller than most of the other parks around the world, but still you have all of the favorite rides and areas, we loved every minute of it. One of the highlights for us, was the amazing Lion King show. Lots of characters around the park, 4 great parades every day. Great family experience. ",5
"Hong Kong Disneyland was the third Disney experience for my fianc  e and me after LA and Paris.It   s smaller than the other Disneylands, and could probably be done in one day, but we opted to pay the tiny bit more for a second day, and ended up very pleased with that decision as we felt we got a lot of payback out of doing rides multiple times. Hong Kong Disneyland seem really good at making the rides effective even if you   ve done them a lot before. Mystic Manor is probably the best example, the details and special effects are incredible, we were noticing new things the fifth time we did it.The Jungle Cruise is also great   we did it four times   with the guides genuinely funny and a great action packed circuit. One of the zebras was missing an ear though.It is the least impressive Space Mountain we have seen yet but still worth doing a few times. The cheap Star Wars overlay does not work, and you can see too much of the track and rigging inside   it really should be blacked out, I thought that was the point.We highly recommend the Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars, we really like it how they did it in their own style rather than just mimic Big Thunder Mountain.Generally the crowds are well behaved with very little queue jumping.We were there on a Thursday and Friday   the park got really busy in the afternoon so I would recommend doing the big attractions in the morning or at the end   in the last hour we were able to walk on to It   s a small world, Jungle cruise, and Grizzly Mine carts without any queue.I would also suggest doing Fantasyland as soon as the park opens   we did five rides in the first hour, which would have been impossible later in the day.The teacups here are the fastest we have experienced and the rides are overall fairly gentle on the head and neck but still a lot of fun. We didn   t really like the Disneyland Railroad (not much to see   this seems pointless outside of LA) and the Iron Man simulator, which looked suspiciously similar to Star Tours.Throughout Disneyland, the cast are not as exuberant as in LA and generally don   t add to the experience, apart from on the Jungle Cruise. But they are helpful and polite and most seem to speak enough English for us to not have to worry. The only time where our our experience was marred by our lack of any Chinese language was the seasonal walkthrough based on the Nightmare before Christmas. There were 5 or 6 sections, all but one were entirely delivered by characters speaking Chinese only, so we were not really able to follow it. Visually it was very impressive but they should have warned guests that they would not understand it if they didn   t speak Chinese because this was the only thing in the park not with no English and it had one of the biggest wait times.I would recommend that Disney seriously considers restricting people from using big sun umbrellas. The Fairy Tale Forest was pointless because people just stand with their umbrellas blocking everyone   s view.Overall the park is probably not as aesthetically impressive as LA or Paris but it still feels very Disney. One area where they excel is how they light up the park at night   it looks great.So going in we though it might not have the genuine Disney feel due to it being very small, but this turned out to not be a problem at all. We also noticed far less annoying stroller parking everywhere than in LA and far less smoking than in France. The food had very good Disney theming. We got our Disney fix and we would recommend it.",5
"Had a great day at Disneyland with the family. We prepurchased tickets at the hotel and took the train with our Octopus card. Very easy using the train system and the quickest way to get there. Go on a weekday to avoid long lines. Food there very expensive. Seemed a little smaller than the US parks, less shows, but the rides are great fun. Toy Story land lots of fun for all.A lot of the eating places were not open when we were there which restricted choices for food.",5
It   s was wonderful went Disneyland lots things. Hot day! Enjoying walking around. Cold drinks & ice cream. Beautiful at night time lots of lights!lovely dinner! Love it!,5
"Having the ability to go to any Disneyland Resort has been a life long dream for our family. Hong Kong DisneyLand is a perfect place to spend time with your family or friends. It's offers a wide variety of experiences, from gastronomical aspects, and imaginative concepts that triggers happiness as you connect to your inner child. The rides are all in pristine condition. And the food has good quality into them. I would definitely recommend Disneyland to anyone I know for the rest of my life. ",5
"Luckily i had kept Disneyland stay for the end of my family trip. The moment one enters the sprawling premises, one realises that only an American venture can be so elaborate, high tech & beautiful. With nothing much to do for a family visiting Hong Kong (in terms of activities involving kids), Disneyland more than made up for it. Built like a fairy  fantasy land with separate sections, one ideally needs 2 full days to be able to enjoy everything. Crowded like mad, there are long queues even for getting snaps clicked with disney characters all over. The 3 parades in a day were a spectacle to watch esp the end of the day as it was Halloween Theme in place. However, my son was hugely disappointed as he totally missed out on doing  Adventure Land  & still regrets it. Fault wasnt ours as we spaced out everything well after finding out shut down time from staff  site who told us it was 2000h. however, when we reached Adventure Land at about 1915h with 45mins to spare, it had totally shut down & nobody could explain as to why as all other sections were still open. Also, we had lost about an hour in the morning view heavy rains. But the authorities wouldnt allow us even limited entry of an hour into the Adventure Land the next day. that i personally feel was highly unprofessional & insensitive as THEY had shut down the section way before closing time. My son still feels miserable when he talks about the trip. So ideally, stay inside for 2 nights   just the right amount of stay. Its worth every penny",5
Its located on Lantau island of HK. Easily accessible by MTR disney line. Trains are also designed in disney theme. Park is pretty big enough to spend 7 8 hours. They also have all the necessary amenities for kids infants too. Its very well maintained. Unfortunately the main castle was under renovation. Also 20% of the rides & attractions were shut due to Mangkhut typhoon which was hit a week before.,5
"Spent 2 days at the park. Didn   t have to queue up for any rides as I am guessing it was off peak season. It was very hot though so I would probably recommend going during the cooler months, but then you might have to queue up for rides. Because of the typhoon there were a few rides that were closed. Food was pretty pricey but was delicious. Was great seeing the halloween theme throughout the park and incorporated into their food design too. Only took our 1yr old on the    It   s A Small World    ride but my 9yr old nephew went on pretty much all the rides. Spent heaps on merchandise too! Would definitely want to go again!",5
"It's our first Disneyland trip and it did not disappoint. We went there for the little bro's birthday celebration but I think it was me that enjoyed the most. I was running and lowkey screaming when we got to the entrance arch. HAHA. A whole day is required to enjoy all the rides. We went there a little over lunch and we missed some. Lines were already forgiving during our trip since we went there on a Saturday in September, not a popular time to visit since blogs say it's already starting to rain in HK during September. Luckily, it was sunny during that time. And we only waited in line for an average of 10 minutes, I guess. Lucky, right?? Food will cost you a lot so it's better to eat outside and come with a full stomach. But if it cannot be avoided, there are food stalls inside. The sausages at Toy Story Land were good. !!!!DO NOT MISS THE HYPERSPACE MOUNTAIN RIDE AT TOMORROWLAND!!!! SO INTENSE!!!! The Small World ride was very cute and chill and relaxing, you should try that too. Since January 2018, there were no more fireworks display to close the day. To compensate, they do character parades three times a day. Because of this, we were not able to take photos with the characters (we prioritized the rides hehe) since no longer entertain photo ops at 5 PM, because the staff will be getting ready for the closing parade. No regrets tho. The rides were super fun. Merchandise is will also cost you a lot, by the way. But again, NO REGRETS! :)",5
"i go to disneyland soon after i arrived at HK airports. you can leave your luggage in the luggage storage near the gate of hongkong disneyland. the ride is mostly for kids. only 1 5 attraction dedicated for adult. its better if you stay in the resirt because its only a few walk away. i visit and september, unfortunately the fireworks is not available due to renovation.",5
"like the title said, its a wonderful place. went there on Aug18 with the childrens and they were stoke!! even the weather was hot hot hot so remember to bring lotsssss of water and mini fan for the children it will help a lot if you bring one. for precaution, it would not be a bad idea to bring a rain coat cause it could rain anytime in HK.the theme park was clean, well organise and very plesing to walk around dispite the number of people there. ",5
We love this place. My 6 years old daughter and a one year old son is enjoying themselves in Disneyland. Most of the rides has no ages restriction like other theme park. We bought 2 days entry ticket and well spend for both days.,5
"Everything is just so magical from start to finish. We took our daughter to Hong Kong Disneyland for her 5th Birthday. She carried a big smile on her face throughout the day. We took our car and it costed us HKD 220 for whole day. Tickets are expensive but worth paying. All shows were good but personally i enjoyed watching festival of the lion king   musical stage show re telling the story of Simba (Hakunama Tata). Waiting time for each ride is around 10 15 minutes (weekends). See if there is a FASTPASS distribution sign near the entrance of the attraction you want to ride. Cartoon characters too have resting time therefore, there's a possibility of missing out on few. Night parade is Spectacular.Quick Tip: At the time of heavy rain you may visit the nearest Disney shop and buy a raincoat worth HKD 60. Available for both adult and child and walk freely in Disneyland",5
"This Disney is great. I was told not to expect much, but I wasn   t disappointed. You get the Disney magic with the Castor framed by gorgeous mountains. There are some different rides with a unique HK spin. The food isn   t amazing and I struggled to find anything other than quick service. But you don   t go to Disney for the food. Love this place ",5
There are halal eateries available on the premise.Easy access by MRT.Kids friendly. There are strollers available for rent.There are nursing and baby care rooms.It's a day pass. you can exit and re enter within the same day.We went to Citygate Outlet in between as it was one MRT station away.,5
My family and I took a 2 days pass for this ticket entrance. I really love this place which I cannot described how much fun I   m having here..At night we watched the firecrackers with the mascot Disney show ...,5
"Yes, I am 24 and this is my first visit to Disneyland which clearly did not disappoint   other than the fact that it was pouring at 11 am when I dropped off at the terminal after taking the hotel shuttle so we had to wait it out but we had an amazing day after.I got my tickets from Klook and it was a fuss free entrance as we scan our printed tickets that was sent via email. And then we used our express pass given complimentary by Disneyland Hotel for all the fun rides and attractions, highly recommend space mountain because anything that is airconditioned and fast never fails to disappoint. After we've finished our priority passes we bought some slushies and popcorns to snack on and walked around to take polaroids with the characters around. Would recommend the trip for family and groups of friends. I've also heard that this is a rather small Disneyland compared to the ones elsewhere so I would recommend visiting this first :)",5
"We visited Disneyland on 9.25.18. Great visit, glad we came after our flight was cancelled. We bought tickets at the Disney Hollywood Hotel. Highly recommend the Iron Man Activity. The castle was closed due to remodeling I believe. We were able to get 1 picture with Star Wars characters, which was nice. Diddon't see any other characters walking around except for the Halloween characters and Mickey once they started playing the Mickey song in the street. A lot of people but maybe because they have holiday now. Recommend the jungle ride.Thumbs up! ",5
This place proved that Disneyland really is the happiest place on Earth. Here your inner child runs wild the park is huge and really clean so it's really enjoyable. Transportation was Interesting. You take a special train to Disneyland this was amazing. Although you aredon't allowed items such as selfie sticks and other things this place is truely magical.,5
"We had a great day at Disney. We saw all the shows and both parades and did the rides we wanted to do.If you are going with somebody over 65, they can get in for $100HK instead of $600HK but they must show their passport to get the reduced price.Well worth a visit for the kids and the big kids too!!!",5
"Loved the HK disneyland, stayed at the Disneyland Hotel where free shuttle bus service from the hotel to the resort was provided. Plethora of activities to do and things to see. Loved the shows shown like mickey and the wondrous book etc. Enjoyed shopping at almost all gift shops, every store sells different things, so do visit them! However, abit too crowded as wait times can exceed 45mins which was a bummer due to the heat in June. However me and the fam had a marvellous time! btw, the highlight was the night time parade which showcased many floats and characters! ",5
"We know what kinds of travellers we are... our family holidays fit into two categories... theme Parks or resorts. And as far as theme Parks go... Disneyland wrote the book, created the genre and remain on TOP. We have visited the Hong Kong park multiple times and it never disappoints. The standards only ever improve. The cast are attentive and in character, the facilities are world class and the rides continually met Disney   s high standards. Our kids always love it, and as they get older, find new aspects of the park to love. Grisly gulch and mystic manor have climbed to the TOP of their list as favourite rides, and Groot is the new favourite character. Jedi training academy could benefit from slightly less Kids in a session, but the new Ironman ride is a welcome addition to the park. Can   t wait to see what they build next...",5
Really love this place Disneyland so much although ticket is quite expensive but really worth it. Food also can be expensive inside. All the rides is so fun! Coming back again this year end.,5
"Many people said that the HK Disneyland is not good as it   s too small. But for a Disney fans like me who have been to almost all Disneylands in the world except the one in Paris and Shanghai, I think the HK Disneyland is small but good enough for many people who have never been to Disneyland. One of the good things about the HK Disneyland is that you don   t have to walk a long way to get to each attraction as the park is not big. Compared to those in other cities such as the Disneyworld in Florida, for a slow walker like me, it   s pretty tiring to walk to each attraction, though there are some means of transport that I could use, for example the bus.And because it   s small, visitors can easily explore the whole park in just one day, giving them more time to see other beautiful places in HK.And for those visitors who like Chinese food, don   t forget to try the Plaza Inn, delicious chicken and suckling pig. ",5
"I always wanted to take my daughter to Disney Land on her 10th birthday.. and from India, Hong Kong is the closest and cheapest Disney Land. Good that I booked two days tickets as we could manage to see everything and enjoy every ride.. there were long queues for 30 45 minutes per ride, but if you have two full days you can afford to waist for each ride and attraction.. my daughter loved the experience..we did most of the rides twice.. best part was that you can carry your water, drinks and food.. that will save you lot of dollars as everything is expensive like any other amusement park.",5
"perfect offset for kids for a whole day's fun n delight. everything is so very well planned and done, there there and away is breeze.  best place for kids for all round entertainment, fun, rides, shows, food choices.",5
"Arrived via MTR station Sunny Bay, then a Disney train takes you to the entrance. Bought on our tickets on Klook and this allowed us direct admission. The park officially opened at 10am but they opened the gates at 9.30 and allowed access to Main Street. We visited on a weekend and although busy we were still able to go on all the rides. We diddon't watch the main parade but did see the Pixar Water Street Party which was great fun and we all got completely soaked. As for food we pre purchased the 3 in 1 offer from Klook, this allowed to eat in a variety of restaurants and allowed us one main course and and a drink for lunch must be eaten before 4pm and a main course and drink for dinner and that could only be eaten after 4.30pm. We also could take our pick of a ice cream or popcorn from one of the vendor carts. Best rides were Iron man and having visited most of the other Disney parks they have a totally different take on the Haunted Mansion. As with all other Disney parks merchandise was very expensive. The parks is covered with free WiFi.",5
Admittedly it is no comparison to USA but it is a great day out. Usually there are no long queues to access rides. There is a great selection for the young and daring and great rides for younger visitors.,5
"Who doesdon't like Disneyland? With great entertainments all around will never get us bored... What's more, a fireworks show and parade show at night is the most awaited moments for Disney fans!!!",5
"Visited on a two day pass, experienced the majority of rides attractions over the two days. Huge site, stunning gardens and pristine facilities. Something for everyone. Catering to both locals and English speaking so some attractions were delivered in a combination of both languages which generally worked well. Cast members were polished performers and we enjoyed the performances were saw (Mickey   s Storybook Theatre, Moana & Halloween Street Party. Thoroughly enjoyed our time there.",5
"I have been here twice and on both visits, it felt like I came back to my childhood years. I would love to go to the other branches of disneyland again!",5
"Compared to DL in the USA, park is small. However, still had a great time.  Went on a mon wed, no lines in the park.  Very clean.  Staff very friendly.  Both parades were fun.",5
"Great environment and excellent service. Awesome character dinner experience with photography session for children. Good food in Enchanted Garden. The hotel itself provides plenty of activities for children. One example is Tai Chi exercise with Master Goofy! Recommended to stay at least 2 days, 1 night to fully enjoy hotel amenities and also Disneyland park. Little Disney Princess Themed Package is a must for your little ones. Surprise is awaiting for you in your hotel room with all Disney decorations. Will come back soon to explore Disney Explorer Lodge!",5
"This is a must visit place for both young and old. You   ll definitely enjoy the rides, the shows and parades. It   s sad though that there are no more fireworks but I was able to witness it when I went here last 2009. Still, the place is fun for the family to go to. ",5
"If you are traveling by MTR, you will get to ride on the magic train but it is not as good as when it was new. If you travel by car, you will get to drive through the most beautiful road in Hong Kong. Either way they are just magical.",5
"I thought this place was awesome.  A smaller less crowded version of the more well known Disney parks.  Shorter wait times for the rides, great food, entertaining electric light parade, its a small world ride.....easy ride from the mtr train....overall a great day for fun.",5
It was great trip. Stayed for 2 days in Disneyland Hollywood hotel .  All rooms are of same size. Rooms are good.  Disneyland is very good. Few areas were u see renovation. My kid loved it it was great fun,5
"If you dodon't come with the expectations of a US Disney Park, you'll really enjoy it. We had a great time here, from the minute we got on the Disney Train, all the way till we left. It was really hot, and there is not much shelter, so you'll have to find respite in rides and shops. There are not that many rides here, and it's probably something you can do in 1 2 days at a leisurely pace, especially if it's not busy (there weredon't any rides that had longer than 15 minutes wait when we went on a weekday).There are some unique features of this park  Mystic Manor, and some characters who we have never met before, like Cookie (friend of Duffy). Lilo is also here.The food here is expensive, and there is less variety than the US. No dedicated ice cream store, only one churro cart, etc..With little crowds, this was quite a good experience for us. The castle is small, but they're upgrading. Transport from the city is easy, and surprisingly quick, even when we left with all the others after the Paint the Night Parade.",5
A good place for adult and children. Had a good fun time roaming around Disneyland and taking rides. To my muslim friends.... there is a halal foodcourt in the theme park. I advise to buy your tickets online and they might have a good  promotion.,5
Not as large at other Disneyland properties but still the happiest place on earth.  Be aware that many rides when standing in queue dodon't have shade so can be very hot.   Not so many rides for entertainment.,5
A great attraction located not far from the city and accessible by mtr. The rides were good and not long ques. Even though it rained we had a great day.,5
It is my second time here. And was happy to know that they have new attractions since the last time I was here. Although a bit sad because the castle is under renovation and there are no fireworks display,5
"This was my first Disneyland and it's fun. I am able to meet my favorite character, Donald Duck!! it is Magical :)",5
"I came down here with my wife for our anniversary, we are in our mid 20's and we were very reluctant it being a place for the kids. However we loved it to the core and had fun for two days, got to become small kids and enjoyed all the rides. My favorite one was Hyperspace at the Starwars. My wife loved meeting all her childhood characters. Overall it was fun.",5
My family and I enjoyed the shows and shopping for souveniers. Just dodon't go there during rainy season 'cause it will spoil the fun. :),5
"I went there with my sisters. More things than I expected, the transportation is quite convenient. Not very busy when J was there so I didn   t need to queue so long. So sad, I got sick after a few ride but I was fine at the end. The waffle is very cute, you shouldn   t miss it. ",5
"If fun , exciting & adventure that you are looking for here is the place. The most exciting theme park I have ever been. Once u entered the main entrance u have automatically become a kid again. Even though it was raining it doesdon't stop me from having fun. Superb! I will definitely come again.",5
"This is a super fun day to spend a day.. very cool and fun ambiance... but if you have been to Disneyland in the US or Paris, then this does not compare well.. not many ride but the parade was fabulous!",5
"Another tourist spot to visit for our educational tour, the    highlight one    for me. It was really fun!!",5
"I'm so lucky that i have a friend who know where she is going or else i would not able to see most of the attraction. There are many ride that is very long line up, but the show that is long line up is worth the wait. amazing lion king show must see. Also if you planning to visit in the summer remember to purchase a rechargeable fan that you can walk around with.",5
"Happy place for kids and kids at heart. Me and my son enjoyed the disneyland park. Though the time when we visited there, the castle is under renovation.      But otherwise the whole experience was memorable.",5
"Easily assemble by train, great Disney experience, by really small if you compare to Orlando.  Great 1 day visit, opens later than Ocean Park.. a must do for any Disney Fan!",5
"Because I dodon't have much time in Hong Kong, I visited Disneyland and Ngong Ping in 1 day. After noon, I went to visit Disneyland until it closed. But overall, I was quite satisfied even though only half a day playing rides there (and still get a little time to see the souvenir shops). Disney is definitely one of the must visiting places in HK.",5
"I visited Disneyland Hong Kong with a friend. Seriously, this was beyond my expectation. I did not know I would have so much fun in here! I bought the ticket on traveloka, which was cheaper and also food included. Honestly, the food was a bit disappointing. but the rides..amazing! I dodon't have favorite, because I love all of them. The fireworks part was the best fireworks I have ever seen. If you are Muslim and need a place to prayer, there is an asian restaurant with a cozy Musholla and they will let you pray there even you dodon't buy food from them. I am so looking forward to visit Disneyland again.",5
"Our visit to Disneyland was a good one! The park itself is a smaller than The Disneyland's in Tokyo and California, but this a good thing. You dodon't have to walk as far to get where you are going. The lines or rides are much shorter than the other Disneylands I have been too. My only complaint is that it was so hot there that I sweated so much it made my shorts look as if I had wet myself. On that nite I would advise you all to visit there during the winter. The staff there was helpful at all times. ",5
Not bad for my first Disneyland experience. I stayed until night to watch the parades and light shows. Had so much fun!  P.S. Dodon't forget to collect stickers from the crew members! :),5
"Hong Kong Disney was great fun. We love returning to the Magic when and where ever we can. The rides for big kids were awesome. Well worth the long lines in the hot weather. The micky pancakes are yummy, the shopping areas are a great place to cool down in between rides and the photos with the characters are brilliant. Even our teenagers couldn   t resist the snugs from Pluto.",5
"I loved this Disney because it is not too big and can be visited in one day. The night parade was cancelled at the 11th hour due to thunderstorm which was a shame. The ticket prices were reasonably priced but food, drinks and balloons etc were extortionate prices. A balloon was $150 which I thought was ridiculous. Queues were reasonable for rides. The most we queued was 40 minutes for the rollercoaster. All others were under 30 minutes. Using the app was helpful to see queue times.",5
What a great place to be with family and friends!  Lovey shows and in the end there was a firework show to end the day.,5
"this was a very special day for me . I wan to visit Disneyland since I am a children and now I got to go finally for my 21 birthday present from my family :)I visited with my cousin and our one friend, we all enjoy very much. Thank y.",5
"We had a great time there, it was pretty pricey buy hey! It   s Disneyland! Loved their bakery goodies, corn. Popcorn and Minnie waffles We liked the fact that we did not have to pay extra for fast pass all we had to do was to put our ticket in and it gave us the times for our fast pass. That was awesome! The heat was killing us though!",5
"Visited this place a few times and the most recent one, we managed to catch the iron man which is one of the newer attractions to the park. The place holds special meaning to us and each time we returned back, the feelings are always very special. Very nice place to visit. ",5
"My 9 year old girl was all so excited. Never saw her this happy. The roller coasters, especially grizzly gulch was exhilarating and kids enjoyed it as much as adults.Fantasyland is a must do for young kids. The parade especially the one in the night  paint the night  is amazingly beautiful and one of a kind experience for kids.",5
"We stayed at their hotel for a night. We were already expecting that we would be needing at least a day to fully enjoy the place. As expected. Disneyland did not disappoint us. The park is beautifully decorated. The rides and entertainment are amazing. We went there on December and it wasdon't even cold. So dodon't wear heavy clothes. I almost fainted of heat. Good thing I brought an extra blouse. They have great restaurants around. We tried this Chinese Restaurant that offers very big bowl of noodle soup. It's good for 2 persons I guess. But we ordered one each. So we did not finish it. The rides are just very... cute. Really for kids. No life threatening rides which some people enjoy. But all in all, it's a great stay. Even the hotel did not disappoint. They sell Disney merchandise which are great souvenirs.",5
I went to HK Disneyland from Wanchai on a rainy Friday afternoon. It was easy to get to on the MTR. The park was not too crowded and lines were fairly short. For some reason the Jungle Cruise line was longer than any other I waited for! Lucky for me they had a line for English speaking and the    river guide    spoke in clear English. Which is more than could be said for the train conductor whose English was indistinguishable from her Chinese. The castle was under construction but I was informed of that before I paid. I had a wonderful afternoon and four hours was plenty. ,5
"Hong Kong Disney is super fun, it   s one of the smaller Disneyland   s which means you could easily do it in one day. Be sure to go on the Ironman ride it   s excellent and the haunted Mansion. A great fun day I recommend Hong Kong Disneyland.",5
"I always love to visit this place at anytime and repeatedly watched shows and the fireworks display at end.  Each time I have friends or family visiting hk, Disneyland not to be missed    ",5

Been in Hong kong Disneyland twice. It is a smaller version of the Eurododney and the original Disneyland in the US.The Hong kong Disneyland specializes in shows which is a fantastic add on to the park usual stuff. I found this place very enjoyable and much better for the parents because you can catch up almost everything in less than a day. Very recommend!!,5
By far the smallest Disney. Easy enough to get most done in 1 day. Went during week so not so many kids. Has all the classic Disney features but on a smaller scale.,5
Our 1st ever experience at a disney land resort. It was lovely. Like the rest of Hong Kong You Gotta Be Prepated To Walk Walk Walk. Extremely unusual rides. Fun Characters. Dont let the rain put you off.The toy shops are wow Even adults were buying stuff lol.Only downside is no muslim prayer room but there is 1 stand near the entrance selling halaal food.Try the caramel popcorn. Too tasty and the smell is divine.,5
"Definitely the smallest of all the Disney theme parks world wide, but it stores a really strong punch of Disney Magic! I visited during the 13th anniversary of the theme park. They are going through major renovations in 2018 and are slated to build a brand new castle! Perhaps by 2021 it will be completed! I've been to all the Disney theme parks and I must say this definitely takes the Chinese culture and melds it in with the traditional Disney experience. They offer grilled squid as a snack! Toy Story Land is a definitely Must See... YOU MUST go on the Mystic Manor ride! It's so much fun and offers a different vision of the Haunted Mansion ride! Another ride you must do is the Iron Man Experience which is similar to Disneyland's Star Tour's ride, except it takes you to Stark Expo where Hydra starts causing mayhem and Tony Stark saves the day! Definitely a totally different ride from anywhere else and totally worth the wait! I'd also suggest staying here if you have the chance! The hotel's Disney Dim Sum is too cute to miss out!",5
"I've been to HK Disneyland for more than 10 times and I would say this first ever Pixar Water Play Street Party is one of my favourite. First reason is I'm specially fond of Mr Incredible and his family and Frozone. They're just too cute! Another reason is the chance to get wet and cool down during the summer. Who doesdon't love the idea of water   dance   party under the sun? LOL. I believe this is a special for summer only. Hope to go again before it ends.Ah btw, they also added Zootopia meet & greet. Another must do!",5
"What a wonderful day at Disney Land!! This was our first Disney Park and WOW!! We had such a great time with all the rides, the themes of the different parks, the food, the personalised waffles and Jelly in the shape of Mickey Mouse, all the small and big details are just WOW! The different shows are a must see so check the schedules. The parade at night is so amazing and beautiful. The down side when we visited was that the castle was under construction so diddon't have that show and get to see the castle or all the princess but what a wonderful day. I would recommend using the MTR and Disney Train for an additional experience instead of the bus..You have to do more than 1 day in order to see all the areas or experience the rides, its a long long day and the parks are expensive so make sure you budget for it but its definitely a must to do and see! We will definitely be back soon :D",5
My daughter had so much fun here. Everyone with kids need to bring your kids here. they will enjoy it!,5
My family went there last June 2018 for my 7 year old daughter's birthday. My baby girl enjoyed so much. She was wearing a Belle costume and they gave us VIP pass for the parade. One day is not enough to enjoy all the attractions. We want to come back again.,5
"We watched the simba show, lovely ..... cartoon drawing session was another fun activity.   Children will love it .... you will need a day to cover it.",5
"Had a great time in Disney land HK. The kids and teens loved the Star Wars roller coaster. Lots of walking, wear comfy shoes! Easy to get there by MTR.",5
This place is awesome... One day is not enough to go around...yeah this is the happiest place on earth even your old you feel the happiness inside your heart... And the best part my kids really enjoyed this place...,5
"If you are debating between Hong Kong Disney and Ocean Park   Disney wins with no doubt. If you have time to do both   they are both worth it.A few tips that can Help:1. Arrive at 10 when gates open   Best to avoid crouds2. Mickey and the wondrous book is a popular show. We wanted to go on the last show (1630)   arrived at 1615 and it was full with no recovery. Arrived early or dodon't leave to last3. We enjoyed a full day 10 20 but there really isdon't a need for a 2 day ticket. It's a small park in comparison to the Orlando parks.4. Fast pass are available only on whine the poo, Space mountin and iron man. You just scan your ticket and the machine prints out the time for you to ReturnIt was great fun even though it rained in the afternoon",5
I visited in 1st week of may.  The rides and shows are just great. I loved the Disney night parade the most.  Kids enjoyed thoroughly,5
The place is filled with amazing rides and playing options for kids.  You could spend a full day here and not get bored. There is ample options to choose from.  Buy express entry tickets so that you can save time and not wait in queue.,5
"One of my favorite spot when in Hongkong  Iove the ambiance , full of kids and for sstar wars fans :)",5
"I knew this park was small. I had low expectations...   It's not as good as Disneyland Anaheim CA, but I did like it more than Euro Disney.  We spent a full day here. I hope I'll be able to visit again!",5
"Disneyland really grew ever since we came last time, which was before Moana. It's fantastic! Unfortunately we never came in August and it was really really REALLY HOT so we could only stay for like 3 hours since our daughter is still small, but still, lots of laughter, lots of excitement!",5
A must visit place if you are in Hong Kong. It   s a lovely place with a great experience. A heaven for small children in simple words .,5
"Disneyland is such a beautiful place that one needs to visit once in HongKong. Enjoy the rides especialy the grease train, what an experience.",5
"My family had a one week visit to Hong Kong (from USA), and decided to spend a full day at Hong Kong Disneyland. This was a great place for kids of all ages. It had fun rides and very entertaining shows. We have also been to Disneyland in California and Disney World in Florida, but the Disneyland in Hong Kong contains various experiences that are wonderfully unique to visitors of Hong Kong.",5
"Buy the ticket from one of the travel agent in Jakarta that give us 10% discount. It's really helpful to cut the queue time on the main entrance.Has been excited since the our journey from thung chung MTR station to sunny bay. From sunny bay there's a special MTR with the mickey and minnie mouse had window.We spend the whole day in there from it's open until closing. Most of the rides will makes us queue for about 15 20 minute, but still makes us happy. To bad we only had 2 chance to take a photo shot with disney figures since we diddon't notice the scheduleThe area completed with a moslem prayer room which very clean but no equipped with the praying clothes, so we have to prepared it by ourselves.We really enjoy a 2 times parade, it's very entertain and also enjoy the closing fire work which very famous and spectacular.It's really a best place to visit ever, never to old to go to Disneyland",5
Unfortunately the castle area was closed for construction however We were lucky enough to get in free via uncle working at Disneyland so I   m not sure about cost wise. We did however enjoy the food the atmosphere turning 23 celebrating here was still a dream as usual for all theme parks go early so you have enough time to enjoy everything. But not too early as the night show at Disney land is even better than the shows during the day. The lion king performance is a 20 10!!! Amazing oh and fried chicken and the sausage rolls have my heart! Definitely visit this magical place,5
"Hong Kong Disneyland is amazing! The best Disneyland I have been to! It isn   t that big and the lines for the rides aren   t that long. I was there for 5 hours, we did 7 rides and met 2 characters. It was however week day so it was quieter! Weekend might be abit more busy. The rides are excellent! Definitely recommend a day at Hong king dinsey. Oh and the parades are amazing too! ",5
"Hong Kong disney not the biggest but would you miss it if you went to Hong Kong I woulddon't, this time it was still school holidays and there were heaps of people but the biggest wait for a ride we had was 5 minutes the biggest we saw was 20 for space mountain make sure you have a hat to keep the sun off although there is plenty of shade around. We spent around 7 hours there just coulddon't hang out until the light show but the parade during the day was fantastic so dodon't miss it we went on rides and watched both a 3 D film show and a stage show that were both great and gave us a bit of a break out of the heat seating down in the air conditioned theatres on top of that there there are plenty of drink and food outlets scattered around the park together with your Disney souvenirs and they are not that expensive compared to what your use to paying in Australia.",5
"A pure vegetarian restaurant located (in Tsim Tsa Tsui) ... serving North & South Indian dishes.  Definitely, the best Indian restaurant in Hong Kong.   Stayed at HK for 5 nights and visited Sangeetha daily for dinner.  Would recommend for authentic South Indian cuisines in HK.",5
This was my first disney land and I liked it a lot as I got immersed in it pretty well. they dont break character anywhere and that is what I liked the most.,5
Smaller version of Disney but equally good. Teenagers had a great day.  who doesn   t love a day a Disney!,5
I know that most people are busy now with their lives but I suggest to live life while working.... This is a dream come true for me .... Being able to visit Disneyland with my 14 yr old daughter is a gift from GOD.... I am saying this because if God did not help me to find a job I will not be able to purchase tickets and I will not be able to afford Hongkong in general :) visit places and have fun while we can since it is difficult to travel if we are old already...imagine long lay overs that old bodies cant take so live life guys :) it was really fun.... will be sharing my DIY itinerary and the attractions that should not be missed to maximize your adventure while in there :),5
Very Modern and Good. Very Nice Rides for all ages. More active and good. Dodon't Miss it. One of the Best Disneyland,5
Managed to go there and being my first Disney land experience I can say it was terrific. All the usual rides and attractions but the Iron man and Mystic Manor rides were the best. The star wars one was pretty good too. All in all a great place to go if you want to spend a day having fun.,5
This Disneyland is not as big as the one in Paris but really lovely and convenient with the MTR. From Hong Kong station the fastest way will be to take Tung Chung Line then at sunny bay station change for the Disneyland line ( a really beautiful tram ),5
"It's so nice HK has specific station that would take you to Disneyland. So hassle free and easy. We arrived there at 11AM. Tip: buy tickets in advance at klook or kkday as it will save your time queueing. Be there weekdays as tourists flock during weekends. We were so happy the weather was so good! Initially we checked the weather one week before and it states that thunderstorms will occur but it turned out sunny! We were able to enjoy almost all the rides, almost but not all. There are still some live shows but I am not really a fan of it. For me, one day is enough as HK's disney is smaller compared to HK Shanghai and Paris, accordingly. If you're visiting during summer, bring gear up comfortable outfits as it is really hot, and wear rubber shoes as it really involves a lot of walking. ",5
"When we visited the castle was under construction but it certainly diddon't take away the Disney magic. It was an amazing sight seeing the park contrasted against the green mountains. There are loads of rides and shows to fill 1 2 days. However there aredon't very many shops in main street USA. Still enough to get your Disney goods.Toy story land was roughly the same size as Paris. Their 'big thunder mountain' ride was a high lite. One of the best rides I have ever been on in Disney park. We all came off in fits of laughter and were so unprepared for all the twists and surprises.We could see there were more marvel rides being built so the park is expanding.There aredon't as many restaurants as the other parks however there is a fair amount of variety. The food isnt massively catered towards western culture however you can still get burgers, fried chicken ect.Being a huge Disney fan I absolutely loved the park and would love to go back once the new castle has been built.",5
"We had a great time at Disneyland Hong Kong. Wait times are not as long as other Disney parks its smaller also. The food is not the greatest, but there is a place that does fried chicken that was real nice and a must try the Lotso ice cream YUM!",5
"A very lovely, a very, very, hot Disney visit! Had a great day here. Firstly, it is so easy to get to from either Hing Kong Centre or Kowloon, taking the MTR. Got here upon opening and were able to get in a number of rides with minimal wait times. The park has many familiarities of the US sites, similar    lands    so it   s very easy to navigate, although The Hing Kong park seems smaller and more walkable. Rides my kid loved: Space Mountain (a different name), the Toy Story Hot Wheels ride was awesome, and of course we rode the Grizzly Mine Cars about three times. Food: prices approximate to other parks. If it is warm out, bring as much water as you can. If you only want Western food there are some spots to get this. Overall, I would go again. I was thrilled by wait times, but maybe this was just luck. There were a number of characters we didn   t recognize because they are popular with Disney Japan, but this had no impact on us. The castle was very small and undergoing renovations so it   s too bad we missed that. Parade was great. Check for weather, bring water, enjoy! ",5
"Got a two day pass this time so my daughter would have a grand time in the park. I expected that the queues would be very long to every ride and every photo op with the characters. It was indeed. We enjoyed the parades the most. Anyway, on the second day, when i hit the star wars shop, I lost my wallet. I was so pissed when i was told that there was no CCTV in the shop. I coulddon't just believe it. But since I dodon't want our days ruined, I asked help from the outside and still continued the journey until we got rescued by a friend of friend who lent us money for train fare and food. At 4PM though, I got an email from Disney that said that it could be my wallet that has been recovered so I ran to the lost and found area, left my daughter who was on queue to Cinderella Op to two nice local girls and voila, recovered my wallet which was intact by the way. With the many beautiful things that happened in between, someone unknown lent us money, two girls promised to take photos of my daughter with Cinderella in case I dodon't come back right away, a lady gave me discount coupons for items I want to buy and so on...I paid back good deeds by paying their items and food. The wallet that was returned was so unexpected! For me, that was magical.So there, Disneyland Hongkong is among the happiest place on Earth and is magical. ",5
Lovely place awesome world of cartoon world visiting second time here love coming here suberb rides     ,5
"While smaller than other Disneyland resorts, it HK Disneyland still has that same Disneyland feeling and many of your favourite rides. Queues are normally much shorter than the other Disneyland resorts (if you steer clear of China HK school holidays). Good for 2 days if your first visit or 1 day for    old times sake   .",5
"Definitely worth visiting early before the large crowds start,the Iron Man ride was great,Tomorrowland a highlight. We did all the rides except the Adventure island and Tarzan's House and haad a full and enjoyable day.",5
"This was my first time at a Disney park and even though this park is midway through a transformation, it   s worth going for the fantastic rides such as Mystic Manor, one of the best dark rides I   ve ever experienced, truly a sight to behold. Other great rides include Big Grizzly Mountain, RC Racer and Iron Man Experience. Can   t wait to go back when the new castle is complete and more rides are added!",5
From getting on the Disney line the trains windows are shaped like mickey mouse and you know the magic begins.I instantly felt like a child again upon arrival. Great store to buy great gifts for people at home. Not the best thrill rides but a great experience.,5
Its not only suitable for kids but most of the teenagers like me were having fun too. The ticket price is so worth it..,5
"A must place to visit for Disney lover.. But when visit in July please wear your sunglasses, hat, bring your umbrella and sunblock.. It do really super hot day.. And wear your comfort shoes..",5
Nice place to hang out with kids..though kids below 12yrs will have max fun..overall a fun place..we did this in two days,5
"May be one of the smaller Disneyland   s, but it   s really clean and well put together. A few of the better rides were closed when we visited so make sure you double check online before you go.",5
"i thought i will not enjoy there but actually i enjoyed a lot, well organized, perfect shows, and dodon't miss lion king show",5
We had a great day at the Disneyland. From the centre of hong Kong island it   s about 45 min with the MTR. The last train is in Disney style to a real Disney station. The park is good to do in one day. The park is clean and good maintained. The rented a stroller for our 3 years old son. This stroller was stolen after 30 min in the park. We get a new one for free. ,5
My family visited Disney HK last October because of my daughter   s birthday.  It is a lot of fun in the part and whole family are really enjoyed.,5
"This is our second time in Disneyland Hongkong but the place hasdon't lost its charm. My son really loved the attractions, Hyperspace Mountain and Ironman experience. We bought 2 day tickets so we dodon't have to rush through all the attractions and we also waited for the lights parade during the evening.",5
I am a huge Disney fan and this was the last park that I had not visited. I absolutely loved it. The cast members are amazing and always willing to help. Hong Kong Disneyland has some really unique attractions. Mystic Manor needs to be seen to be believed. This is a lot of fun and no other Disney work has something like this. I had a lot of fun with various character interactions. The Paint the Night parade is a must see.,5
"We love all things Disney!!! So on our visit to Hong Kong I knew Disneyland would be a HAVE TO DO thing on our vacation. And it did not disappoint. The park is much smaller than its USA counterparts but it is still a great Disney experience. There were little to no lines, many of the rides were the same so I got to ride rides that I wouldn   t wait in line for in the USA. And there were many rides the US parks didn   t have. The characters were all awesome and interacted with everyone in our party. I would definitely say Hong Kong Disney is a must do attraction while in Hong Kong!",5
Student silver annual pass costs only $800ish and is just 45 mins away from city centre. Also recommend to visit Inspiration Lake which is 5 min away by bus or 15mins by walk.,5
"We made a mistake by coming after lunch (planning to see the 8.45pm parade and do not want to overtire my son), should have come earlier as we do not have time to see most of the exhibit.Bought 4meal coupon for the 5 of us, which provided to be to much food, the portion were quite generous.You can rent stroller at Fire Station at Main St for 120KHD; recommended if you're bringing small children.",5
This is a dream world. You yourself wodon't believe the pictures you too over there. Its a magical place for all age groups.,5
"My first Disney, so if you have been before you may not agree. I loved it. Staff at rides and shops etc were extremely helpful. The queues moved quickly. Food was expensive and quite good quality. The only issue I have is I wanted to get photo's with characters but diddon't see one, which was disappointing, and we read the park brochure but there was very little information about where they were positioned during the day. I think you need more than one day, as we only had a short amount of time.",5
"Absolutely worth going to even if you aredon't a Disney fan. It was spotless, service was fantastic, rides were great, shows were enjoyable and definitely worth allowing one full day to visit. We went on almost all of the rides and saw all but one show and had dinner, watched the projection show and then the parade and it made for a full day. It was very enjoyable but very hot. Make sure you bring cash for purchases at small stands and remember there are ATM's if you need them. There isdon't a lot of shade and in ToyStory land, not much shade. And it was hot! We loved it and would definitely go back. MTR drops you right at the entrance!",5
"We came to Hong Kong Disneyland to avoid the huge crowds in the USA and France. Whilst it is definately different given alot of the ASIAN themes in some of the shows. It is definatley far less expensive than the other parks and less crowded. The staff seem to genuinely love their jobs as they all seem very happy. definately try and go mid week although we went Monday and Tuesday and whilst Monday was great with nearly no line ups. Tuesday was almost double the crowd size! Only  small  negative we thought was the limited food options. Would be nice to be able to grab snacks like hot chips or dougnuts instead of just pop corn! other than that, highly recomended!",5
"We bought our tickets via klook and it saved us about HKD58 per pax. Very fast checking of baggage before ticket booth. No long lines. I love that children below 2 yrs old are free. Lines for kiddie rides are on the average,    only    40 minutes. Not bad if you are carrying a toddler as you need to park your stroller before entering the cueing area. Food prices are as expected, on the high side. If you want to skip long lines, opt for the sit down restaurants like Maxim   s. Great Chinese food. Actually, I have not tried the other dining outlets. During our previous visit years ago, we also chose to eat at Maxim   s. At least, it is consistently good. ",5
"After a stressful and chaotic trip to Shanghai Disneyland, my teen and I actually dreaded this trip to Hong Kong Disneyland, but it was prepaid so we tried. I am SO glad we did. We arrived in the afternoon on a Friday and decided to get in a half day at the park. We were pleasantly surprised by the lack of a crowd. We immediately noticed the friendliness of the staff and the smiles which were not common in Shanghai. The staff gave stickers and really tried to help us in English when needed. The crowds were well behaved and I was not pushed once all day!!!! Even the parades and the projection show were fun, orderly and well managed by the staff. Shanghai Disneyland could learn a lot from Hong Kong. The park is small and the castle was closed which made it feel smaller but it was so clean and happy that we really enjoyed ourselves. The Royal Banquet Hall in FantasyLand made us vegetarian spaghetti with marinara sauce that was really good. We also went to the park on Saturday and it was still pleasant with an increased crowd.",5
"Whether you are a child or an adult, do visit this place. It is amazingly beautiful and has many rides for people from all age groups. In summers do not forget to carry your hand fan as it gets very hot and humid. The toilets are available at every 5 10 minutes walk which are very neat and clean and are air conditioned so one can tae rest in the washroom. Outside every washroom, drinking water tap is available so carry your refillable water bottles. Do carry pram if you have a child. Prams are available for rent also. Do not miss the 7pm Mickey magic book show and the 8.30pm parade. The rides almost last not more than a minute. So cant enjoy rides much but the shows are all amazing.",5
"The youngest of our group was 7 and the oldest 57. Everyone had a great time. No extreme rides for thrill seekers, but fun just the same. We went in June so it was hot and humid. Pack water bottles, there are water filling stations everywhere. Go early and be there at opening as it gets really busy around midday. By mid afternoon the park was pumping with people. We went on a weekday so crowds were manageable. My tip would be to do Ironman and that section then hop over to Toyland if that   s on your list as it gets very very hot and crowded over there in the afternoon and there is limited shade. Wait times there were the longest at 30mins and in the heat we decided to bypass it. Food wasn   t as expensive as I expected. It   s not cheap though either, so have a good breakfast and if you choose something like a rice and curry for lunch it will fill you and keep you going until closing. Small snacks could have been taken in, but I think anything big would be confiscated. Don   t miss the Lion King show. I did and family who had seen the stage show and we   re unsure about going to it, said it was fantastic. I now regret not making the time to see it.",5
I went with no expectations and left with one of the best experiences so far to date. Its small enough to get around the whole thing in a day and the attractions are pretty incredible.,5
Its Disneyland. Whats not to love! We were only slightly disappointed as the castle is under renovation and so was a few of the rides. But there were still plenty of other rides to keep us occupied. All of the attendants I came across with were nice. My boys had an awesome time. one day does not seem enough especially if you have kids (toilet breaks nap break icecream break exploring break). The parade was an awesome closure especially when the members turn and wave at you for shouting their names out. Adults and kids slept dreamily that night. A magical place indeed.,5
Hong Kong Disneyland Is fun and relaxing and even though it is small and very complacent it has all the centers the musical themes the characters and the rides,5
"When ever possible, always go to Disneyland! Two days ticket is good and not much more expensive than one day ticket. Very walkable area, much smaller than in Shanghai I guess. Many good restaurants. Not cheap, but YOLO :)",5
Yes the park is small but we loved that you could do it all in a day! The friendly and welcoming staff and atmosphere make every moment enjoyable! The parades were outstanding! Such a great place for every age!,5
All I can say is a whole day is not enough to experience everything inside the theme park. The best ride for me is the Mystic Manor second is the RC Racer and third is the Grizzly Gultch. Marvel Ironman Experience is also ok same...More,5
I first visited Disneyland HK 13 years ago when it first opened. It has since grown and still is a magical place to visit. It is a small Disneyland in comparison to the ones in the USA however it suited us with a young child....More,5
"Must visit if travelling with kids. It's all about the kids really. They have nice rides, attractions, shows  (e.g. lion king) and entertainment. Everything is well organized including the outlets serving lunch during busy hour. The parade is not to be missed, quite spectacular and...More",5
"This is worth the money. Yes tickets are expensive but the quality of the rides and the well kept grounds at worth the investment. Our five year old did not complain once about walking 15,500 steps (Fitbit) usually he would complain when walking 200 steps...More",5
Just like any over disney it does not let you down.  Just take a umbrella on a hot day because it was crazy hot and not any places to escape the sun.   Very easy to get too on the train.  The staff where great most...More,5
Visited Disneyland Hong Kong with family. We travelled there by train. Easy acesss by train from our hotel. We tried all the rides and enjoy the foods at the restaurants. We particularly like the Space mountains and the Buzz Lightyear rides. Will visit again in the future. Thanks ,5
"The happiest place on earth, great for families everyone speak English and was very easy to get around the meals are great and at guest services you can get times of the character for photos. You can hire a pram which is great if your kids get tired. The metro there is also beautiful ",5
"Disneyland is a whole new world insulated from the mainland with happiness written on everyone's face.Sadly, the castle with sleeping beauty etc., was under renovation and not accessible. The Toy Story land rides were all non operational.Otherwise, despite rains, we braved our way through the rides and attractions, and yes, we did enjoy.The rain and the walk did tire us a bit, and added to the adventure.Vegetarian food is very very limited inside. We would recommend vegetarians to pack their meals for the visit.Overall   Feel good factor was good and RECOMMEND, more so, if you have children below 12.Recommend two days   one day will be too rushed and tiring. Two days will let you soak some things more than once at a not too rushed pace.Our List of not to be missed rides  shows:  Mystic Manor   Being unique to HK Disneyland  Hyper space  Tomorrowland  Grizzly Gulch  Iron man Experience  River Safari  Lion King show  Mickey's Wondrous book (Could not make it, but highly recommended by others)",5
"We pre purchased our tickets from Klook so no waiting at the gate.. although all lines looked short anyway. We arrived around 2pm, just in time for the parade which was good. Wait times for rides were between 5 and 40 minutes. Mostly with waiting for. The shows the put on was the highlight for me, particularly the Lion King show. The park closes around 8.30pm. So we found about 6 hours long enough for two adults.",5
"With this Disney I now had all 6 under my belt. This one is said to be the least favorite but I thoroughly enjoyed my whole day. Yes, it is small and the castle was an eyesore being renovated. No one seems to understand the fast passes so I was able to use them all day. Went on a week day and it was the best crowd size I have enjoyed in years!",5
"After having been to Disneyland Paris and Japan I thought why not Hong Kong. Unfortunately we had a lot of rain the day of our visit so some rides were closed until mid afternoon. Good range of attractions and rides for all ages with a good selection of different restaurants. The park has an app that makes getting around a breeze, the app also gave wait times for major rides and attractions. ",5
"Disneyland never disappoints and is a wonderfully magical place. I have never been to any other Disneyland and I visited the Hong Kong Disneyland with a couple of friends who go to the parks in the states yearly. Hong Kong disneyland is smaller in comparison to the other Disneyland but it is just as magical, with shows happening all around the park all day long and characters walking the streets. We had a suprise while attending shows when us Americans (being only english speakers) were greeted with bilingual shows! We found this quite entertaining. We went to this park in November so everything was decorated in a Christmas theme and they even had a Christmas parade and a wonderful (fake) Snowfall!!! My friends had been missing our snowy winter weather at home so this was a fantastic surprise when loads of snow was shot over the crowd with flashing Christmas lights and festive music.Would definitely recommend visiting the Hong Kong Disneyland to people of all ages as it is truly the happiest place on earth! Also, I believe they are beginning to expand the park and it will soon become about double its size!!",5
Had a nice and crazy experience in Disneyland Hong Kong. Good for beginners as i heard from many people. for me it was my first Disney land experience so i enjoyed it!,5
"I remember telling myself that I would not enjoy at this    childish    place, but I was proven wrong. I was able to enjoy all the attractions and rides offered here. I realized that despite being mature for my age, I still liked being a kid at heart. Though, the adventure can be tiring, so make sure that you are well rested before coming. Wear comfortable shoes as well. Come early so you can make the most out of the rides. We stayed there until closing time and we still wanted more of it! It is a really a place that takes you back to the past, allows you to enjoy the present, and makes you look forward to the future! ",5
Disneyland is always the happiest place on earth! Easy to get to by train. They are doing renovations at the moment but still enough to do & see. All rides & parades great!,5
"No words to express, you must visit to feel the same.. KIDS come alive in you once u reach these theme park and u will become kids with your kids..",5
"Travelled here with the family and t'was really awesome seeing a lot of things such as mickey mouse and other characters as well. Very recommended for kids and to those who wanted to experience what really Disneyland is, its a BIG WOW,",5
"Like any other place. Good set up, friendly teams all around, good activities, decent rides to explore. But the best things to do and not miss if you visit this Disneyland in HK is The lion king show!! It was just awesome for all age groups. Rest all activities are nice to explore too. ",5
"Our family of 4 was in Hong Kong visiting and we always visit a Disney park when traveling abroad. This was our first visit to Hong Kong Disneyland and we opted not to stay onsite, but the park is so calm, that we really did not need to.From our hotel in Mongkok, the MTR ride to the park was only about 30 minutes. We lined up for entrance and it moved pretty fast. We never needed to use a fastpass and we were able to ride everything we wanted to. The cast members were also very helpful and we just had a great time. This is the only park in the world that is not as busy as other Disney parks, but I think that will change soon with the new castle and the new additions. Mystic Manor was our favorite ride, but Hyperspace Mountain was a close second.",5
"we thought one day is not enough, but, surprisingly, it was! Disney Hongkong is apparently the smallest Disneyland in the world, so one day visit is just enough. the happiness from my 5 year old faces seeing buzz, woody, donald and the rest of the disney characters was truly priceless!!!we didnt have any problems going to the place due to a very accommodating tour guide!",5
"We went on MTRand caught Disney Resort train which takes you straight there. Train has mickey windows and statues inside. The handles above are even mickey shaped! They sell a reduced ticket for over 65   s so worth remembering. It is a lovely park although the castle was being renovated. There are 7 lands to visit in all and shows, parade and evening parade. It is smaller than California disney but well worth the visit. Food is quite expensive like all theme parks but you can take your own. So easy to get there...we had a great day",5
"Maybe this attraction prefer to kids. So many kids attraction at here. So after we see disneyland, we promise if we have children this place must be visited again. Easy acces from kowloon. Just get mtr to this place near from airport. Prefer go to this is weekdays. Big place and great experience. One day i think is not enough for around here. There is no masjid (mosque) so little bit difficult for moslem to pray. Every area have greatest show. We only get micky mouse show and very very great. We are very excited and so professional. Foodcourt have halal food. Buy ticket by online is better than on spot. Closing ceremonial is the best show. Thank you",5
"I had purchased my park tickets from a travel agent a few days prior, this meant less queuing at the park, it was also cheaper than buying direct, I got this in Tai Po but am sure most travel agents will be able to help.Arrived early Via a 2 buses from Sha Tin, the transport links are brilliant and well signed, We arrived before the park opened so near the front of the que and saw Mickey and Minnie greeting people before the gates officially opened. The park its self is smaller than the others I had visited (Paris and Orlando) but still plenty to do. Lion King Show was a highlight and we saw this twice. With the help of some good fortune Fast passes and single rider queues we managed to get on 11 rides see 2 shows one twice and meet 3 characters so if you plan your day well it   s easy to see a lot of the park in one day, which is not really possible is any of the others. The Space mountain now a Star Wars ride was really well themed, the Avengers part of the park was also very well done with the iron man ride a nice little attraction, but very similar to the Star Wars rides in other parks. The Mickey Mouse celebration projector show was first class and well worth the wait. Couple of Negatives for me, the Castle was closed which we knew about but obviously takes away the famous photo opportunity, also the iPhone app and the Website showed different times for the park closing which also meant it showed the wrong time for the parade, this left me sat on main street an hour longer than I had hopped.But overall a very enjoyable park with some very fun rides, it is most certainly is the happiest place on earth.",5
"It is a must do for all tourists visiting Hong Kong. While it is quite big and the walk can be tiring,I still recommend people of all ages to visit Disney as it is fun to just let go off your self and become a kid all over again at Disney. There are fast rides as well as moderate rides. For those who do not want to sit on rides can enjoy the shows. Do not miss out on the Lion King Show, Mystic Manor Show, Mickey's Wondrous Book & Phillar's 3 D show. Also a must do is the Night Parade.",5
"We are Disney fans but hate standing in long lines. If you are like us, try HK Disneyland. Weekdays are slow and the shows and food are great.",5
"Super Duper Disney !  Enjoyed the family day @ the Disney resort with fun filled games, rides, eats, memorabalia, etc  Fantastic locale, fun for all ages from 3 to 80 !  Always happy to be there",5
Roller coaster was scary but fun; food was really good; shops had good products; parade at the end of the day was magical,5
"This Disneyland is supposed to smaller than others. However, the shows were excellent and there are long lines in this place. It is recommended that you buy the fast tickets. It is a fun park to do. However, the rides are not as great as the Adlabs Imagica ones at Lonavala. So they were a bit of a disappointment.",5
Its a full day trip at the disneyland. This one isnt bigger like the US one but good enough to keep kids occupied for a day. Beautiful parade at the noon and closing time. And loads of free shows whose timings are posted and updated based on weather conditions. Tip : Can be very crowded for weekend and public holidays with 45 60 min waiting at each ride. Try going on tuesday wed and thurs. Less crowded. Also try cloudy and raininy days.,5
Children enjoyed all the rides. Love its a small works and mystic castle. The kids rode the star wars roller coater 4x. I rode once but was about to puke after. Mainly for kids only,5
Of crs it   s the    happiest place in the world     It   s the right size for someone like me to cover everything in one day  Beautiful!,5
So much fun! The park is perfectly sized for a full one day visit! Great place to visit for families with children and adults Disney fans who are kids at heart! Mix of Classic and new Disney characters and rides.,5
"Lovely theme park with different themes for all ages and audiences. Got there for opening but coulddon't actually get to the rides until 10:30 which wasdon't great at first, however the rest of the park was still amazing, and you can get to it from the MTR as it has its own stop too.",5
"Disneyland Hong Kong is value for money. We bought tickets that included lunch and a waffle. Lunch was so filling that we didn   t even use one of the coupons. It is very clean with staff regularly cleaning the park. There are several smoking areas around the park and staff are very friendly and will show you where things are. There was almost no long waits for rides which was awesome. The merchandise is reasonably priced, and easy to find in the shops. The light show at the end of the day is breathtaking and beautiful. All around amazing experience! Will definitely return and recommend to anyone! ",5
"Visited on a Sunday and it was a long weekend in HK. The great thing is although the crowd could feel overwhelming especially when queuing up at the entrance, somehow when we were inside it didn   t feel as bad. Don   t get me wrong there are queues and everywhere packed but probably because of the design everybody   s dispersed more or less evenly. The food and drinks are expensive but you would expect it given such location so no point complaining. The souvenir shops are well stocked with variety and plenty of shops to temp you and kids. Takes a very strong will to not spend on any item in there. All in a great place to visit, if you have kids just bring them you are guaranteed a good time here. ",5
"Great experience for kids especially Disney fans. The park facilities are good, though it was bit warm during the day during our visit.",5
I have been to Disneyland in Florida which was and experience not to miss and I would definitely say the same about this one.,5
"I've been here several times since they first opened.  My first visit was disappointing as the park was much smaller than all of the other D'lands.  But everything I go, the park seems to have expanded more than the time before!",5
"I've been to Disneyland in other countries, yeah thoroughly enjoyed the one in Hong Kong! Fun for kids, adults and groups",5
It was raining in n off the whole day!  June 12 2018.  All the team were doing their best but .... weather is just not on our side.  Great job,5
"My daughter and I had a magical two days here celebrating her 13th birthday, travelling all the way from Sydney, Australia!Right from the time we entered the park on 30th May things were lovely. We loved the photographer who took our photos at the gate and later again on Main St. Her name was Harley and she made our buying the photo pass well worth it! The photo lady at the Winnie the Pooh ride was also really helpful, explaining how the photo pass worked and getting all of our photos downloaded onto the app on my phone. (She also helped me download the app and helped me sign up.) It felt so great to see the professional photos from that day and even breakfast all there, safe on my phone! I wish I could mention her name too!Although we were just able to do all of the rides in one day (we went mid week out of school holidays) we also needed a day to line up and have photos with characters. My daughter loved meeting Piglet, Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore, Cinderella, Aurora, Chip and Dale and Minnie and Mickey. Just be aware that the lines always seem to be really long for Minnie and Mickey and you have to be early and quick for the princesses (except Princess Sophia as she doesdon't seem very popular at all).We had 12 fast passes for two each from our hotel (Disney Explorers Lodge) but we only ended up using 5 of them because there was not more than 5 minutes wait time for any ride apart from Winnie the Pooh and the Parachute Drop. We did use them for the Winnie ride because my daughter really loved it. We really loved being near the It's a small world ride early in the day when no one was around. I love that It's a small world and Winnie the Pooh are air conditioned. We also especially loved the Mystic Manor ride (also air conditioned).We took our own water bottles in and loved our meal at the Plaza Inn for my daughter's birthday. (We booked in advance but it was not busy.) The pork fillet was delicious. The other evening we ate fish bites and chips in the cafeteria at Tomorrowland which was pretty standard American food but at least it was air conditioned and quick. We also had the incredibly cute donuts which my daughter loved eating.We knew the castle was being renovated in advance but the Main Street photographers still managed to get nice photos of us with it. Main St was pretty much deserted about 3pm the Wednesday we were there so we got some great photos! Again, thanks to the lovely photographer, Harley!Well worth visiting, especially if you are from Australia as it is not as far as the USA. Thanks, Hong Kong Disneyland, for a magical visit!",5
A fun space for all age groups... The creativity and the beautiful attractions for kids is totally commendable. The rides are all good . 5 stars for the time managemnt at the shows and rides.... Praiseworthy. We had a lovely time with our kids and they both enjoyed it to the core.,5
24 hours is not enough..... must go back and spend at least 2 days there! So much to see and do but so little time!     ,5
"Mention Disney, and most immediately think crazy crowds along with Disney Magic. Hong Kong Disneyland is one of my favorite parks because it strikes the perfect balance retaining the magic and charm that we have come to expect from a Disney Park while also having lower than normal (for Disney) crowds! Be sure to avoid weekends and holidays (I only went during non Holiday weekdays) when I hear that crowds can be much thicker, and you will enjoy shorter wait times, the ability to randomly catch a parade or show, and the opportunity to take it all in at a leisurely pace. This Disney fanatic recommends two days to be able to experience EVERYTHING in the park (all the rides, shows, parades and a couple of repeat rides on your favorites) but I realize that I am the exception and that most could do the park well enough in a single day. The unique to Hong Kong Disney rides are definitely worth going out of your way to experience if you are in the area and a fan of Disney at all. For our family, it was simply magical!",5
"Best place to visit in HK. If you are a kid at heart, this place is best for you. Or if you have kid's this is the bedt place to visit in HK.",5
I wish you had something more than 5 star rating ....impossible to express the joy and fun my kids had!,5
"HK Disneyland might be smaller by size compared to other Disneyland   s but it sure don   t have less to see. We were on a Saturday, normally that   s a no no for any kid friendly places but there was little to no line... till after 2pm. After that I had no ideal where all those people came from. Even with the lines (mostly 15 20min wait) we saw almost everything. We missed a few thing because the timing plus we had a child with us, so that don   t help with timing. Over all we had a great time and what I think the best part is that since the park is smaller in size there was less walking to go from place to place. (lol)",5
"Small but wonderful Disney! Staff could be a little more into the Disney spirit. The park is kept in excellent condition  pricesfor goodies a little on the high side, but it   s Disney. Lots of character greatings, que for rides short 10 20 minutes.Had a fabulous time.Buy your tickets online, you will often get another little something like a $50hkd meal voucher, or merchant voucher.",5
A must attraction when visiting hong kong. Amazing experience .The minute you step into the park everything was magical with their background disney music. Navigation inside the park is easier by using hong kong disneyland apps. The apps will give you real time updates for their show and lots of helpful info can be found in the apps. We really had fun throughout the day..,5
"The most exciting part of our HK trip. To start off, we travelled to Disneyland in MTR to experience the mickey themed train! It was fab.. We loved it.. Even the MTR Disneyland station was so cool! Do not miss this.. If you have enough time.. Take the train! We stayed in Disney's Hollywood Hotel.. It was convenient.. no need to worry about transport.. Plenty of shuttle buses available from the park to the hotels. Coming to the theme park, alot of people suggested that one day is enough to cover the park, but i personally feel that if you want to get a full Disney experience then go for 2 days. That's exactly what we did and we still diddon't feel it was enough..(maybe we were just too excited !)The park is big (although i read it was the smallest of disney theme parks). Be sure to get a map and the show schedule when you enter.. Take note of the shows you want to watch and manage your time accordingly. Expect long queues after afternoon at every ride (waiting time around 30 40mins). Tips : (1) Start off with the 'land' that is furthest away first to avoid queues. Some lands open after 11am..The best for us was Toy Story Land.(2) Meals are quite reasonably priced in the park as compared to in the hotels.. So we had lunch and dinner at the park (also because we waited till the final parade). Plenty of Vegetarian options available too. (3) If you have two days, watch all the shows, stage plays and parades on day 1 and do the rides on day 2. That's what we did..so we had ample time for pictures and exploring.(4) If you want to meet and greet characters, be in queue atleast 15mins before else be prepared to wait atleast 60mins in queue. (5) The castle is closed for maintenance works till later this year. There is no fireworks as well. Overall , we had so so much fun in Disney.. Loved it , recommend it !",5
The kids had a wonderful time at d8sneyland. The weather was fine. Rides are aplenty and the lion king show was really superb.,5
This is must place to Visit in Hong Kong.. really good place to all.. for full family it   s very nice.. really all indoor shows are very good.. out side rides are also good.. Good management  good planning.. 1 full day is enough for whole Disney land.. 11 am to 8 PM... ,5
"My boyfriend and I came here yesterday and it was really good. At the start it was a little disappointing because all of the rides were shut due to the typhoon. But obviously that was no fault to Disney, it was just bad luck. However thankfully they opened up later in the day so we really enjoyed them. We only ate in one restaurant and the food was really nice and the service was quick and friendly. The shops on main street were also really good. Full of great Disney merch at decent prices. The staff there are also very helpful. Despite there being bigger rides here they definitely aren   t    thrill    rides, but they are still enjoyable, just more on the tame side. Unfortunately they are renovating the castle so we couldn   t get a decent picture infront of it but never mind. The park is also very small compared to other Disneyland   s but we only had a day ticket and we managed to do everything so that was fantastic and worth the money. If you   re wanting a trip to a nice, easy Disneyland that isn   t too expensive then this is definitely the one for you.",5
Was always fascinated by disney land growing up & hearing peoples experiences. Finally got to spend 2 days & experience first hand the magical place. great time at hong kong disney land. Will cherish the memories for a long time to come !!!!!!,5
Go here with you   re children And have more then a Nice Day. Children And adults all love this park!!,5
"Loved this Disney park, ok not as big as others but no long queues for rides and attractions. We were on most rides without queuing and could walk around and get back on the ride.We have been to paris and Florida Disney numerous times but this just had a different feeling to it, a lot more relaxed and pleasant. We were lucky as it was a overcast day, still hot but kept out the sun.We could watch the parades x2 and fireworks without all the usual hustle and bustle of other Disney Parks.Definitely worth a visit if your in Hong Kong.",5
"Its fanstastic. Specially for people who come for a holiday with kids, you must visit Disneyland and stay in the Park area itself. You can cover all the rides and shows if you stay for 2 days. Besides the rides, you must try and see all the shows currently going on. The Lion King show was fabulous. Dont miss the parades in the afternoon as well as night parade as both are different. Unfortunately during our visit the castle was closed and there were no fireworks. Try to cover Tomorrowland and Adventure land 1st as there is maximumn waiting time there.",5
"You need to be smart to enjoy the HK Disneyland. Tips: Its easy to reach by the metro line as there is special metro line for Disneyland. Try to reach before the rope drop. Dont carry selfie stick as its not allowed. Pick the park map. After the rope drop just rush to the attractions of your choice and take the fast pass. Fast pass machines are installed on the important attractions and you can find it in the park map. You can avoid long queues if you pick the fast pass in advance and it gives you the time by when you need to come back for that specific ride attraction. This was you can save time and avoid queues. Please note that you can pick only one fast pass at a time. So plan your day smartly. Do try out the Hyperspace mountain extreme roller coaster and the Mine Cars. Trust me, its not just for kids, adults can enjoy too.",5
"Parents should bring kids  their children here to play. when characters become alive.   Meet Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Bambi, Moana, Toys Story, Ironman  It was entertaining and the place was good to visit. far from city, and most importantly less polution",5
"This is such a worthtrying destination once you visit Hongkong, for its beauty, magnificence, marvelousness, majestics. Animation Academy is a good beginning. Main street is full of stylist shop and background for shooting. TIPS is you should follow the path that is contradict to other visitors. Like if people go first with TomorrowLand, you should start with AdventureLand instead so that you dodon't have to queue and wait for long time. ***Must   try:. Star wars in Tomorrow Land. It's a small world in Fantasy Land. RC Racer in Toy Story Land. Mine Car in Gruzzly Gulch. Rafts in Adventure LandThose are what i have tried and really recommended to others. It's such a sophisticating world that if you can enjoy it, really worth it. ",5
"Visited Disneyland for 2 days during May 2018 with family.....senior citizen and children as well.This is the place to visit and i love it the most. You cadon't take your eyes off the d  cor they have made in the Disneyland.Different themes for each area...I believe there are around 5 different themes in the park and each one has unique theme and was surprised to see that even the toilets are made according the themes.Excellent rides, expensive food, dodon't forget to ride in the Disney train.Do take water with you. They do have drinking water inside but if you have empty bottles it will be good.",5
Can be done in a day but start early to catch the shows and meeting the characters. Western food was difficult to find so we snacked on the best popcorn ever. My 4 year old son enjoyed it thoroughly. Glad we took his stroller with. The castle is unfortunately under construction at the moment.,5
"Had a wonderful day, so easy to get here from anywhere in Hong Kong, unlike Disney's in the US it's much quieter, space mountain was never more than a 5 minute queue all day!! Longest we queued for any ride all day was 20 minutes but it was more like 10. FYI Grizzly Gulch had the cheapest food options that I saw, the only alcohol is on Mainstreet and there's smoking areas between each park.It gets really chaotic in mainstreet before the parade but that's to be expected.",5
"We took my 5yo daughter here and she loved every minute. The rides, the shows, the characters. Even the queues weredon't too bad. We'll be coming back.",5
"Been twice about 8 years apart.   A small park compared to others but in saying that it is really enjoyable as crowds aren   t so large.   Adding more attractions all the time, and easily accessible from Hong Kong",5
It will indeed give you an experience of a lifetime.Rides and attractions are made for any one. It will let you recall your childhood memories.    PlacesForAllAges,5
"When we headed for Disneyland i was personally though this place is for children, me and my freinds thought we will sit at one place at let kids enjoy the place.To my utter surprise it turned out to be different. Totally totally different. I enjoyed more than my kids. The child within me was reborn.One of the best places on the earth that i have visited so far. We were there for two full days and walked around 20kms or more to cover and see each and every show and place in disneyland and no body in the group felt tired. The place lives upto its tagline   the happiest place on earth. We were so excited after first day of visit that the second day it was announced that it is a storm of 9 danger. We (including kids) were so disappointed that we did not came out of our rooms. But as it is said   when you seek from GOD with all your heart, he obliges  and magic happened. The storm warning came off at around 11am and then there was no looking back.A must must place to visit with kids once in a life time. I BET YOU WILL ENJOY.",5
"My wife and I came to Disneyland with expectations that we would be too old to enjoy it. Gladly we were overjoyed with the fun experience. It is a large park so expect to spend at least 6   9 hours there to enjoy all the park has to offer.Plenty of food, plenty of tourist shops and souvenirs to buy from. The rides were free, that was a surprise because we thought they may have charged for attractions but they were free to enter. The attractions, rides, tours, interactive experiences were very enjoyable and worth spending your time to seek out. Tons of things to do, you and take your time and sit around and take in the carnival atmosphere.The park was undergoing some renovations so we diddon't see everything but what we did experience was a lot of good fun.Easy to book your ticket from a hotel from a Handy handset in the hotels or on your mobile phone. The price was well worth the experience, go and have a look you wodon't be disappointed!!! Much more than I can describe! 11 10 from me!",5
"Love hong kong disneyland!, try avoid month of may july as the heat is crazy! Crowd was alright during weekdays, each rides took about 5 10 minutes queue. Make sure to bring empty bottles for water refills near any toilets unless you would like to pay the ripped off price mineral bottle water. Food was expensive but nice! The cinderella and the price was kinda disappointing. Avoid renting baby strollers during summer, unless you want to bake and sun burn your baby. The main castle was closed for renovation...very disappointing again. Poor dancers sweating so much in their custume parade. Generally will visit again! Mystic manor is a must to visit!",5
"Little did I know that after having a wonderful, fun filled, memorable experience at HK Disneyland with my family including the newly discovered Advance Pass for its attractions, where you dodon't need to fall in line and just have to go back on your designated time. It was truly amazing that means we can save time at no extra cost and maximize most of the tours in Disney.Now going back to my review is one of the restaurants inside Disneyland located on the Main Street USA zone near the entrance   Plaza Inn Restaurant. Just after the Flights of Fantasy Parade we stumbled by accident this place as we are about to exit. And with utter coincidence we are looking for a good authentic HK Chinese food in particular Roast Goose. Inspired by Mulan anime   the interior is very authentic cultural Chinese with red lanterns and intricate furnish and carvings. The service is nice and hospitable. The ambience is relaxing, luxurious and comfortable. The toilets are clean and spacious. The airconditioning is perfectly cool. We are a family of 8 with 3 kids and of course very hungry after a long day of walk at Disneyland HK. We ordered 2 servings of Yang chow fried rice good for 4 people, Roast goose, Beef broccoli, Roasted pork belly, and a Chinese oolong tea for hot drink. They dodon't serve free water but the drinks were affordable. True enough the one that stood out amongst the dishes we ordered is the Roast goose   savoury, succulent, juicy, tender and fresh. Despite the flavours and spices added you could still taste the freshness of the Roast goose   and most of all it melts in your mouth. HK has many famous restaurants that serve Roast goose. The flavour stands out for any combinations and it is very delicious                     The price is very similar to a typical restaurant inside the park which a bit pricey than outside but then again it is worth it. Next time you visit HK Disneyland dodon't forget to drop by Plaza Inn.",5
"When my boys were young, my wife and I took our children to Disney in Florida, Los Angeles, Paris, and Japan before Hong Kong Disney was open in 2005. Comparing with Hong Kong Disneyland with other Disneyland in other parts of the world. Hong Kong Disneyland began as a tiny one. But over the last 13 years, Disneyland added new games into this tiny one. By now, I would say, Disneyland in Hong Kong is not big but good enough for 1 to 2 days if you have 1 or 2 kids to play with. I have been to Hong Kong Disneyland about 4 to 5 times. I would say, they need to continuously expand to keep up with visitors' expectation.",5
"First time to HKG Disneyland and the kids first time to any Disneyland. We pre purchased our tickets and included the meals to take away the extra cost of meals during the day. Worth the extra. Kids enjoyed it and I'm pleased to say we diddon't have to wait too long for any of the rides, benefit of going during the week. Took the MTR there which was fantastic",5
I had some time so I went here for the day and I was very glad I did.   Brought me back to my childhood and seeing all the young Chinese enjoying this place very much.  Highly recommend For couples alone or with children,5
"No matter which one you visit, always manages to transport you into a carefree zone. You just never tire of it, you just lessen the coasters as you grow older. The shows, the parades, the treats and the fireworks never fail go bring one joy.Go early, take your time going home after the fireworks to avoid the crowd.",5
We had a very tight schedule so we have to just go for 1 day.  We made the most out of it.  The highlight is the IRON Man.,5
"Well maintained, not heavily crowded. Max of 15 minutes for each ride. Good restaurants to have food. Had fun whole day.",5
"Plan your activities before hand, based on your time. Enjoy each rides, shows and have fun.   We went there yesterday morning before the gates open. We were satisfied and fulfilled.",5
"Disney characters are adorable most people spent their childhood watching Disney movies. We went there on China National day and crowds are full, have to long queue of each attraction around 30mins 1h30m. Even for take photo with Mickey & Minnie. To be honest it was not ours best trip, we will visit again next time not on China public holiday. ",5
"We went to Disneyland Hongkong in the month of September in year 2013 and I must say it was a very nice experience especially when you are with the kids. Kids really love this place. It was very hot and humid though so we just could not bear the heat. One has to wait almost for an hour in the long ques to take a ride on a swing. your kids can get pictures clicked with the famous disney characters. water and food is very expensive inside. Even the Disney toys are damm expensive but you wont get them outside, so just grab it if your kids wants one. There are few free water coolers so you can get your water bottle refill. In all a nice experience but choose the best month to visit Hongkong else get wet.",5
"We had a great time at Disney, although in our late 40's we still had an amazing time. Very well organised.",5
Visiting Disneyland was like meeting all your childhood friends. Characters you loved growing up are all around you. The best was Marvel characters also included.,5
We went before they raised the prices last year.  This time around I put my foot down!  Not as extensive as Florida,5
It's an excellent place to rekindle childhood and bond with family. Dodon't miss out on the parade as well as the fireworks.,5
"had one day pass at disney during the week arrived when it opened ( not on purpose) not much waiting time for the rides we went on would recommend for all ages we found one day was enough but we didn,t do all rides",5
"It's a place where magic begins as the sayings! It is a wonderful experience so many theme parks and lots of fun. I enjoyed the mosts were : IronMan experienced like a real ride with Iron man as he battles, it was intense and you will feel you are in it! And Mystic Manor, magical & whimsical experience, very colorful and musical and fun. Feels like I was brought back to my childhood. The shops were packed with disneyland stuff to buy. The line to take pictures with the characters were very long!!The restaurant's food were ok, usual burgers and fries but they closed at 4pm. Wish they're open till the Disneyland closes. Only drinks you can buy by the side walks. Its a long walk around the theme park so bring along or you can buy on the spot umbrella, sun visor and water. It was a lot of sweating for us as it was summertime but the experience is worthy!!",5
We can take the food pack the food properly and keep it in the bag security person checks the bag randomly we indians cant eat the local food what we get there take enough food ........,5
"Guys few tips to use it effectively  1. Travel by MTR, it saves time and cost2. Go to Fantasyland first and start early in the day3. Keep Winnie the Pooh show till very end after 7 PM when queue gets smaller4. Visit in weekdays5. Very few food options for pure veg in the park, eat something filling in breakfast ",5
"Must do activity with kids if you are visiting HK. Spent two full days here and thoroughly enjoyed our time. There are some really nice rides, you get to meet lot of characters, did Jedai training which was fun and in the evening projection show and parade is not to be missed. ",5
The Iron Man ride was pretty new and it was amazing. However what my friend and I enjoyed (and will always enjoy I guess) is The Festival of The Lion King show. Watching the performers sing and dance is something that interests us. The fire exhibition thrills us to the bones! My Magic Access Pass truly has an awesome purpose! ,5
"We travelled as a family consisting of 5yo, 7yo, 15 yo, adults in our 30s, 40s and 60s. We went over several weekdays and no problems with queue wait times  the longest was Parachute Drop (20mins approx) and we really should have gone on this one earlier in the day, as it is a notoriously longer afternoon ride wait.There are just so many Character Meet n Greet opportunities, it was fantastic.Do not miss the beautiful Fairy Tale Forest!Weather: Humidity ranged from 75 95% and temp 24 31degC. Some days were sunny, mostly days were cloudy and some with light showers. There was probably only 1 day we could say it 'rained'.We had small plastic bottle sprayers that we pre filled with water and left in fridge the night before  it was so refreshing and cooling on our really hot days.Another great idea I had read on the disneytourist blog, is to use small gym chamois type cooling towels. These were fabulous to have  I bought ours from Target for $5aud ea, they really helped in the warm weathet. The night before, wet the towel thoroughly, seal off in a tied sandwich freezer bag and put in fridge overnight or for a few hours. During the day as towel dries out just wet it again under a cold water tap.I suggest downloading the Disneyland Hong Kong app (great for map, character times, queue wait times the Park has limited WiFi)With two parades, three shows, an evening Light Projection Show in Main St (instead of fireworks whilst Castle is under maintenance) , approx 17 rides things to see plus numerous Character opportunities, at the minimum I would suggest a 2Day ticket. If you are staying longer, look at a Magic Access 12month pass)  most of our party purchased a Silver Magic Access Pass (no weekend entry) and we went 3 4 different days. We didnt have to rush around and we got to do our fave rides more than once or twice.The Silver magic access pass also gave 10% disc on merchandise shopping and 10% off at character dining and sone general dining in the Park (or had meal deal free drink kind of offers).Fave rides? I would say Iron Man ; Runaway Mine Cars and for my daredevil brother it was Hyperspace Mountain. But we really did love most of them. Glad we got to see Festival of the Lion King, as this is about to change to Moana show.We had 2 (cheap) strollers we left in the stroller parking area many times , no problems there with anyone stealing them!Because we went to the park on weekdays, we had no issues with long wait times (plus we tried to do the popular ones earlier in the morning eg Parachute drop) .We tried to ask the children which Characters they REALLY wanted to see eg their Top 5...otherwise it can be time consuming (not to mention exhausting in the hot sun) spending lots of time queuing up. I found it beneficial to check Character times before we left and noting down the times and location on a piece of paper, spread out throughout the day based on their 'must see'! We started queueing 5 10min before so we were in the line several times we arrived 10 15 mins from the start time and they had already closed the queue due to so many people. Mickey and Minnie seemed to have the longest lines.We dined at The Enchanted Restaurant at the Disneyland Hotel  it is approx 15 minute walk from admission gates of the Park. We absolutely loved it, we dined mid week 5:30 7:30pm and from around 6:00 7:15pm we had Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Pluto. They come separately to every single table and the official photographers come too. Their helpers will also take pics with your phone and cameras. And the food! The variety was beyond belief and delicious. And dessert buffet, (see below pic) oh wow! Soooo good, highly recommend.",5
"Its a hyped park nothing as compared to the Disney in US or Paris . Ocean park is 1000 times better . Most of the rides are silly and in uncovered areas which can be difficult in summer . They don   t allow outside food and water but even when we are ready to pay exorbitant charges for lunch they provide a set Indian lunch which is tasteless and moreover we don   t have a choice . You have wait for at least half an hour in queue even for lunch !!!! Some of the rides were closed and there was no fire works on the day we went 14th May . Considering that fireworks are the must see , there was no announcement anywhere about its cancellation . Strictly avoid in summer and also during weekends . Don   t buy two day pass as one day is sufficient . Visit only if you are not planning to visit the US Disney otherwise nothing to talk about this one",5
Disneyland Hong Kong truly is the one of the best places on earth to go and see . You don   t even need children to have a good time .it was just my husband and myself.,5
"If you are fan of Disney then this is a MUST go to place. Best to go during the weekday as weekends can be rather jam packed. Lots to do and see, and rides to take.... quintessential Disney experience.",5
Disneyland is just amazing and a full of life. Everywhere there are Cartoon characters. There are kids & cartoon shows everywhere. The rides are simply enjoyable for adults and kids of every age. Amazing restaurants and kids shops scattered everywhere. In short a BLISS.,5
"We had taken a two day pass but diddon't come the second day as it can be easily covered in a day. Ocean Park is definitely more exciting than Disney. Also if you have visited Universal Studios, you may be disappointed with Disney.",5
If you have kids or looming to enjoy a sunny day in HK head over to Disneyland. A great outing indeed. Fro the time u set foot off the MTR which is customised as well for Disney......U will be entranced by the song and dance . The gardens peaceful and serene. ,5
"Great day out for young and old at HK Disneyland. Similar size to Disneyland Paris and also very well done. It   s really hot here, so make sure you pack sunscreen and lots of water. Shows are amazing! Transportation is really easy. I would highly recommend!!!",5
"Me & my family total visited April 30 2018 it was excellent experience,my both daughter loved so much ,also don   t forget to watch 4.30 pm Mickey Mouse road show in Disney world,also if you   re children are more than 12 years old start discovering Disney world from last point.also amazing is to visit it   s small world ",5
We purchased our tickets through Klook and printed them off. This worked smoothly. The castle is currently under construction but the rest of the park is functioning normally. This is a smaller park but with four kids we still didn   t fit quite everything in one day. We went on a Friday and the lines weren   t too bad. We enjoyed the high flying parade at 12:30 and were really impressed by the Festival of the Lion King show. My kids 5 9 all really enjoyed the Jedi training activity show. We tried to eat cheaply at snack stands   they only take cash. Overall a great experience. ,5
"Absolutely loved our visit here, really enjoyed being big kids. I   ve never been to any Disneyland before, so when I was told this was a small. I was taken aback, as there is plenty to do and as it was a week day, there were virtually no queues for the rides and we got the benefit of the full experience.Overall, I highly recommend a visit here.",5
Disneyland is the Happiest Place except for buying souvenirs and stuffs . But I can say that this place will make you make you want to be a child again . A place that you should not skip on visiting while you   re in Hong Kong. This is my 2nd time to visit but still I can   t get enough of it. The experience of singing with the casts while they are dancing and you dancing and swaying with them. And that feeling of disappointment when you got the unexpected selfie with pluto but the camera was in a 10s mode ,5
Very small but a good experience of Disney. We went on a Thursday and longest que for rides exhibit was about 15mins. You could prob see it all with the major bits in about 6 hours,5
"If you are visiting Hk make sure to add this on your list! whether you are visiting as a single, couple or with family! The ambiance of this place brings you back all the childhood memory! Family friendly. Make sure to bring a hat or umbrella very hot during summer. ",5
i love Disneyland. the shows are world class. you must go to the Lion King show. it is incredible. the costumes are just amazing. get there early though to get a seat. i was amazed at the number of seating areas there. most in the shade too. The jungle ride was so much fun. The parade was great. If you stand near the Pandora shop for the parade there is an interactive show. It really is the Happiest Place on Earth. So many rides for all ages too. The food was priced well too. There is a bit of a walk from the station but nothing too strenuous. A must vist place. ,5
"Yes, it's pricey but Dreams have no price tag. I'll share tips to make this affordable. Every kid deserves to visit DL once & every adult must visit DL to become a child again.Why to visit Disneyland hong Kong ?Probably the least expensive of all ( as per my understanding )Westernised, though in ChinaLovely staffMagical interaction with every character.I will emphasize on   LOVELY STAFF  again.. I'm 27 year old & staff played a very important role in making me happy. From getting me first wagon of every roller coaster to personalised meetings with the character to going out of the way only to get me polybags to carry my souveniers, Staff played a vital role. Thank you.Parades are beautiful.Rides are great !!And being the smallest DL, you have to walk a lot less compared to others.Absolutely least or NO Queues at all. Call me Lucky maybe :PWhy not to visit DisneyLand Hong Kong?If you dodon't care about Disneyland. Or you're quiet short on your visit.USEFUL TIPS   HACKS :Reach by 0930 at the gates, you'll be the first one to hop in.Do ask present staff at every ride for the first wagon, they will definitely agree if you're polite (at the most they will ask you to wait for the next ride).You can make your visit affordable by carrying snacks which are sealed & a water bottle too.Best rides ? Hyperspace Mountain ( Definitely for Star Wars fans & adults ); it's a small World, Mystic Manor, River Cruise ( for kids ); Iron Man Experience & Big Grizzly Runaway Mine cars ( every age )DO NOT MISS NIGHT PARADE.And If you wish to meet IRON MAN, go to Iron Man Tech Showcase ( Most people diddon't know about this)CONCLUSION:Yes, I will visit again. And will definitely recommend the same to others.",5
"Very Good if accompanied with Children. I loved the Section, futuristic world, and the toy train which goes around the park",5
"Loved spending my birthday at HK Disneyland. The staff were super friendly and when I went to collect my first time visit badge, I got another badge for my birthday and collector stickers which were a nice treat. The park was nice and clean and on the day I went, there were minimal wait times for the rides. Too bad the Cinderella Castle is under construction but it was still a magical day!",5
"Ive visited Hong Kong Disneyland many times. This time was no less fun!2 adults and 2 kids....9 and 13yo. We all enjoyed the attractions over 2 days. The 9yo probably had the most fun though!Weekend days are much busier than weekday.The only disappointments were probably the food selection and the Theatre. The food seemed a little limited and the quality was OK, but not as good as it could be. The theatre was disappointing as its mostly in Chinese. I get that probably most guests are Chinese, but it just left me feeling rather disappointed (there are English words projected on a highly visible screen however)The highlights for me are (Hyper)space Mountain and Grizzly Gulch Mine Cars, along with Mickey's Philharmagic. Its a Small World is a nice calm cool break from the outside world.The Jungle River Cruise has to get a mention, as the cast members always add a bit of fun and cheekiness to it. And Mystic Manor is goods fun too!If you love non stop ride action, getting fast passes is well worth it on the busier daysI havent been to any other Disney parks, but from what I know this is one of the smaller parks. You can do it in 1 day but 2 would also be fun. Its probably more suited to the younger kids (5 12) but with an open mind, anyone can enjoy!Transport options are plenty, with the MTR popular and easy. Wear yourself out before your flight home with a visit, its only a 5 10 minute taxi ride to the airport at about $70HKD",5
Although Hong Kong Disneyland is known as the smaller park I still loved spending two days here. I would recommend to do the younger kid rides first such as Pooh's adventures as these ones have the longest lines later in the day. The two main rollercoasters were always less then 10 minutes wait so dodon't rush to do these. The Lion King show is a must see! The songs and performances are next level with the majority in English. The parades are also magical and even without the castle it is a great experience for friends and families. Minimal vegetarian options (although the burger in Tomorrowland was great) and I woulddon't recommend the food voucher as it doesdon't save you much money and limits where you can eat. Bonus of staying in a Disney hotel is that you can get express entry through bag check and the entrance gates.,5
Even it   s not the biggest Disneyland in the world   I loved it! Everything is in English which makes it perfect for tourists! So much better than Ocean Park!,5
"If you're an avid Disney fan, Hong Kong Disneyland is a fun way to spend a day during your time in Hong Kong. If you're used to Disney World in Florida, this park is teeny tiny compared to even just the Magic Kingdom in Florida. They have all your standard classic rides with some fun unique ones like Mystic Mansion. There's also some very different food choices at this park which reflect the flavors of Hong Kong and other Asian countries. The park is very easy to get to as it has it's own MTR line and stop. So check it out and have a magical day!",5
"My husband, my 7yrs old and I loved disneyland. We went in the middle of the week so there were hardly any queues. We are not fans of big & fast rides so this was perfect for us.The jungle river cruise, Tarzan   s tree house, fantasy garden & it   s a small world was so much fun. Whatever you do, make sure you stay for the night parade",5
"It's a Experience to Magical Journey. From India, nearest Disneyland is in Hongkong, so selected this place. We stayed at Disneyland Hotel and visited the park for 2 Days. My daughter loved it. Starting from the room decoration to balloons to complimentary Mickey Mouse, everything was just perfect. Characters at breakfast table, having pic session with them was great experience. Overall hotel was great. Coming to the park, it caters to full family. I cannot do the rides, for people like me also so many shows were there. Great Experience, always will cherish.",5
"We are regular visitors to Disneyland in California and have visited Disney World in Florida. Hong Kong Disney is smaller but worthwhile. This is our third visit. We feel it's great for younger kids as part of a trip to Hong Kong or nearby and for US Disney fans looking for something different yet familiar. These are some reasons why. Queues are a lot shorter than in US parks. Their most popular rides while we were there seem to be in Fantasy Land like Winnie the Pooh. Most other rides were walk on on weekdays. On weekends, longest wait we noted during peak time was ~30min but easy to avoid by going back in evening. We waited no longer than 5 10m for Mystic Manor and Iron Man in the evening. Iron Man, btw, is a simulation ride like Star Tours but BETTER!We also enjoyed the parades, especially the Spring Time Processional which featured different cast of characters like Judy Hopps, Nick the fox, and even Mary Poppins.We also like the variety of foods offered, a lot more diverse than in US parks. Several different Asian cuisines are represented, as well as American fare. This was a huge and fun difference to US parks. Though prices are still Disney high and quality to be expected which is not five stars in execution. Some may not care but bathrooms are important to me! And the few I went into were really clean, cleaner than in US parks. We paid    88usd for a two day pass, which is a lot cheaper than in the US. Even though park is smaller with less attractions, we were able to squeeze more rides in per day cuz queues were shorter. Though note that park closes early at 8:15 or 9:15pm. Transportation to the park was super easy and convenient via the HK subway system MTR. We took the MTR to Sunny Bay Station then transferred to the Disney Themed MTR direct to Disney Resort Area. I will review the resort hotel separately but want to note here that shuttle to fro park and hotel service do have minor areas of improvement.",5
"I live in Orange County, California where the original Disneyland Park is located, and I have an annual pass. So I had to come here to take a look. It's very similar, with some minor differences. It's very clean, everything is basically new, and when I visited it wasdon't crowded at all like the one in Anaheim. We took the MTR to Tsin Yi and then took the Disneyland line. It's really cute. The train, train station, and the area are all themed so if you're coming here with kids (we diddon't... just adults who act like kids sometimes), it's all part of a nice big show.",5
Everyone is friendly and happy to help. The character greetings seem to be really popular with the (I assume) mainland Chinese so the rides aren   t as busy. That said we did wait in line for at least an hour for a photo with Minnie and Micky. Not as many food options as Disneyland. Parade is good. Didn   t hang around for the evening show. ,5
"I had a wonderful time at Disney World Hong Kong. Although we had some rain early that morning, it all cleared up later the day.I bought a raincoat from one of the shops. Very expensive though (70HKD) for a flimsy plastic coat which I will not recommend people to buy. Rather get one of the umbrellas (178HKD)Food and drinks   too expensive. Noodles for 120 HKD and a Coke for 55HKDUnfortunately I could not see the castle because it was under renovation and construction.But in general, I had a wonderful time and enjoyed EVERY MOMENT of it. This is indeed a must see in HK",5
"I have been to other theme parks but this was my first time on Disneyland. Although the rides are not that adventurous, it was still fun for me. Their rollercoaster did not have some loops but is still a great ride. Highlights are various shows offered around the park like the Lion King, check their schedule so you wodon't miss them. Make sure to stick around until 8:15pm for the parade. ",5
I have visited disneyland hong kong more than like ten times a year... We hold platinum access membership... It is the most happy place on planet earth... Some might feel it's much smaller compared to the ones the other countries like that of Florida in the states which are huge ...I have visited that one as well but i personally felt it's nice to have all the attractions close by in a park.... Overall it's a must visit attraction when in Hong Kong,5
This is an amazing place to spend some time for both children and adults. The gardens are brilliant to walk through and the atmosphere of the setting extra ordinary. You need time to explore this gem for a relaxed time out in nature.,5
"Spent the day at Disneyland and had a great time.  Very family friendly and good for all ages.    Not a big park, but had a good variety of rides.",5
"I   ve read all the reviews about this place being small but you have to take this place for what it is, it   s Disneyland. You have to take it all in, the atmosphere, the shows, the meet & greets. They also have some awesome attractions that are unique to Hong Kong like Mystic Manor and Grizzly Mountain Mine Cars. The crowds are nothing like the US parks, I think the longest we waited was 15 minutes and most of the rides were walk ons. The night time entertainment was great and made for Magical ending to our day at Hong Kong Disneyland.",5
"Friends suggested me to visit Disneyworld, but I diddon't expect to get back to feel like a kid once again in my life. The price you pay is worth 100%. All the rides are free and if you get there early and in the middle of the week you'll be able to enjoy all the 10 hours. DO not miss the parade at 8.15pm.The only disappointment was the Castle under renovation... ",5
Loved Hong Kong Disneyland although it is much smaller than the Anaheim one There was no big queues and the same happy atmosphere Beautiful clean organised park,5
"Pre purchasing the tourist ticket with a lunch time meal is a good option as the food for purchase is, like most tourist attractions, excessive without the high quality though the food is served in large portions and is adequate. The attractions and displays are fantastic and before you know it you are going around again and marveling at how the time has flown! Well worth it!!",5
"Spent a day here and it was amazing, Had lots of fun though i   m not into extreme rides. Went here twice already but always crowded. Prices here  Are almost the same in UK more or less.",5
A nicely themed park. Each of the arenas are filled with activity for all ages. The only issue is that there is limited choice of food for vegetarian travelers. The themed park is such that it is not enough even when you spend 4 days. Great experience,5
6th time visiting in 10 years. Staff were friendly and courteous as always. Lots more activities and attractions on offer than when it opened. Saw some new attractions being built so it looks like there will be more to see with their expansion.,5
"Hong Kong travel is not completer without Disneyland. I felt like I was a kid again. Very good for family and friends for a day tour and fun activities. Lovely just lovely! Whole day here is like a whole new world of fantasy, love and happiness.",5
"We have been to Walt DisneyWorld, Disneyland, Disney Paris, Tokyo Disney and when in Hong Kong had to add this park to our list. We were used to the massive crowds, long lines and wait times at each park. With tickets ordered online, we were ready to experience the Hong Kong version. We went on a Tuesday morning and to our surprise there were no lines. The most we waited was ten minutes! The overall park was considerably smaller than the parks in the U.S.It's a Small World ride was a lot better than the rather boring ones in the U.S. The Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway MIne cars had a twist but wodon't spoil the surprise! We loved the Mystic Manor which was similar to the Haunted Mansion but more interesting. Toy Story Land was great and had cute rides. One of our favorite showcases involved a large book with characters portraying scenes from popular Disney movies. Some of the songs were sung in English or in Chinese. Translations were on screens which was great. The restaurants were much better at other parks. Overall, we had a great time and would recommend if you are a Disney fan.",5
"We visited HK Disneyland last March 30, 2018. When I was still planning our trip, I felt that the price of HK619 per person was very expensive. Good thing, I made a research and was able to purchase discounted HK Disneyland tickets in HK Airport   China Travel Service for HK 530 ticket. When we were in HK Disneyland, I realized that the price I paid was worth it, given the fun & enjoyment my family experienced there. The parades were amazing. My favorite ride was  It's a small world . My father who is 74 years old had fun too. It was quite challenging for him to line up. The shows plays were great. Great job Disneyland. Thank you for our wonderful experience there.",5
"Rides suitable for teenagers and children, can be accompanied by parents as well. Place is beautiful and people continually take really nice aesthetic photos everywhere here. Most of us grew up going to HK Disneyland and we still feel happy whenever we come again.",5
Must do activity for sure if you are visiting HK. lots of activities for kids. Lion King show is must watch.,5
"Wow, I took my family (wife and 2 children aged 2 and 7) Both my kids absolutely loved Disneyland Hong Kong, in some ways better then Paris. managed to go on every ride apart from the 4 or 5 that were for taller kids. You can meet with Micky, Minnie, Pluto, Donald, Goofy Timon, Rafiki, Baloo bear, Woody, Buzz Lightyear and others, my children were so over the moon when meeting and taking photos with all characters, this was not available in Paris Disneyland (only Mickey). Best rise was roller coaster Star wars galaxy, The Iron man simulator experience was brilliant.i went on a good day, the queues were very short. For the price of the ticket it is worth it. I visited both Disneyland and OP, they are both great and easy to get to by Taxi or MTR.",5
"This is the ideal Disney for young children, (aged 2 8ish). Even our 2 year old could get on most rides and nothing had a queue so they could keep going round and round as many times as they liked. The park is small but pretty and with that Disney magic feel. The fireworks display was wonderful and a real highlight! ",5
"Every visit is a great experience. It was our 4th visit and there are always something new to experience. Tomorrow land was the kids' favorite. It was great for Disney to include Star Wars and Iron Man experience. Though food is more expensive now compared to 3 yrs ago, there are also more to explore. One day is not enough to experience all the rides and attractions. Two days is a stretch and we were still not able to see everything. Tired feet but priceless smiles and wonder was well compensated. They never wanted to get out of Disneyland. Definitely a place to bring your kids and kids at heart.",5
It   s awesome. One should definitely visit it. They have exciting thrilling rides. Kids will definitely love it. There is Disney parade which one should not miss it. Someone visiting HongKong has to visit this place,5
Hopefully I'll have the chance to visit here again. I was gutted I left my GoPro at my hotel. I was in a terrible mood the day I visited as I wasdon't supposed to even be in Hong Kong. My connecting flight to Bali had been cancelled and I had to stay in Hong Kong for a few days. MY GOD I'm glad I did! This was amazing. Genuinely better for thrill seekers than Thorpe Park or Alton Towers. Some of the rides were truly incredible I was surprised they let 5 year olds on them! My personal favourite was Andy's race car. I went with 4 strangers who were supposed to be on my flight to Bali too   I made lifelong friends!,5
"Went to Disneyland with the entire family and for 2 of our kids, it was their first time. We enjoyed immensely and stayed til the Parade. Only thing missing was the Castle which was under renovation therefore no fireworks :( we'll save that for another trip back ",5
"One of the very few Disneyworlds on the planet. Especially accessible to tourists from this part of the world. It would be a grave mistake to assume that this is for kids. Its for the inner child in all of us. This is awe inspiring, jaw dropping and all the other superlatives rolled into one. Get into the mood and become a child for a day. Does need maybe 2 days to completely see this park.Must visit!",5
We just got back home from Hong Kong. Disneyland was great but some constractions. It is little smaller then one inParis but it has lot to offer. It is just diferent. Great parades. Good was ok. I would go again.,5
"My wife and I visited Hong Kong Disneyland in March 2018. It was not terribly crowded and its compact size made it easy to get around to all the attractions we wanted to experience. Also, the fact that we stayed at the Disneyland Hotel also made it convenient. There is a Disneyland local train the connects with the local subway system, making a trip into Kowloon simple and inexpensive. Our favorite ride was the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. All of the Cast Members at the Park and Hotel were very friendly and spoke English. Being senior kids (over age 65), two day admission was less than $22 US. What a deal!",5
We visited here whilst on holiday in Honk Kong . Were were staying in Monk Kok easy to get here on MTR and only 2O Hk dollars. Last part of journey is on a Disney MTR. If you buy your tickets from Klook on line it will save you 8% on ticket price and will get you straight in. We went on a Monday and the park was very quite walk on to Mystic Manor which is superb big grizzly mountain which was superb walked on three times.Hyperspace mountain only had five minutes que as did Iron man experience and it's a small world and jungle cruise . The only think not so good very expensive food and snacks and not much choice at park . Also lots off characters walking around for photos .If In Hong Kong highly recommend . ,5
"Second time in Hong Kong Disney, will go yet again! The street parade at the start of the day is in one word  Spectacular  The characters and cast are really so into their performances, it makes you feel like you're watching a real princess prince  Tinkel Bell. We also once again loved the Lion King show, so colourful and energetic. They are currently renovating the Castle , so no fireworks show at the end, but the electric light show made up for that.",5
"In HongKong, I have met Chinese friends. They are so cute and they take me around HongKong Disney. It is really beautiful, you know, my friends taught how to play those games in there and then I tried my best to be the winner. It was so happy at this moment. I really love HongKong",5
had an amazing time here. Day well spend. You can easily block 1 entire day for Disneyland. Went with a 4 yr old but most rides were suited for the toddler. Buy tickets online for better deals,5
Went to Disneyland on a the Wednesday before Easter and found that the crowds were not as bad as I was expecting. The park opens at 10.00am however some of the lands within open at later times. The Disney app is worthwhile using as it has real time waiting times for the rides and attractions and also a GPS enabled map to get you around however as there are only wifi hotspots unless you have data the app will drop out when there is no wifi. Make good use of the FastPass options as this can save time in queues but remember that you can only have one pass at a time and cannot get another one until after a specified time which is on your ticket. Plenty of food options available and souvenir stores and carts are everywhere. Stay for the Disney Paint The Night Parade at the end as this is well worthwhile. Get a position at the end of Main Street and watch the parade come to you. Also lets you get out of the park as soon as the parade has ended to get to the station ahead of the crowd. There were several areas under maintenance on the day that I was there however still plenty of other things to see and do. I had a great time and would recommend kids (and adults) of all ages to go.,5
Always wanted to visit disneyland. What a place! everything is so magical. Jedi Academy was an amazing experience.,5
"I visited this place with my family. The children had the most amazing time. The first time we visited was on a weekend and it was really crowded. We visited the second time and we scheduled on a weekday and it's all worth it. The parade was awesome! The floats are designed grand and costumes are really amazing. Everyone is happy!!! The most awaited part was the fireworks display, lovely. It's well recommended for families with children. Must visit during winter. Avoid during summer because it's really hot!!!",5
"From the metro rail that takes you to the Disneyland with Mickey ears for Windows to the magical giant door entrance to the Disneyland, this is where dreams come true! Children or adults, everyone has something to do. Each Disney character has a space, music, rides and even dressed up live characters in some cases. The evening parade is like life enters these characters and then ends with fireworks over the Disney castle! I can never ever forget this experience and I would say this is something of a must do once in a lifetime if not every few years! It changes you. Makes you happier and cheerful!",5
This Disneyland is smaller than others I   ve been to but the lines were shorter too. Less walking and I didn   t get as tired. Staff as great and the kids had a great time. Some rides were different from what I   ve seen elsewhere but the change was nice. We really had a lovely time!,5
"Our Trip to HK was going to visit Disneyland. Me and my daughter was had so much fun and exciting. We love it there. Busy but that's not bothering us,we still enjoying the time.my kid was very happy that the main thing. Negative: only just the Castle was Closed",5
Perfect weather to visit Hong Kong Disneyland. We enjoyed walking in the theme park. The rides are fun and safe. The queue is long but fast moving. We enjoyed the Iron Man Expo the most.,5
"Really have a magical day . Wow the punch word , practise what they preach and make it so magically. Really enjoy the experience there. The boat ride was so much fun, the lion king singer is so clear sharp voice, the Winnie Pooh ride was cute, love the it is a small world ride ",5
Its awesome for kids.. Okay for teenagers because not so much thrilling attraction.. Not too good for seniors because its waaaay too big place to walk for seniors... Unless u use wheelchair (they rent wheelchair for 60hkd and 120hkd for stroller..) We go there at friday.. And the queue for every attraction is waaaay too long... Cant imagine how it goes when its public holiday.. Overall its okay..,5
"We are big Disney fans with kids 7 & 10. Having been to Paris & Florida, we were desperate to go here amidst a trip to a few Far East locations. We stayed at Explorers Lodge Hotel which was fantastic, 15 mins walk to the entrance and free fast passes for each night you stay.The park is like a typical Magic Kingdom with extra Toy Story land, clean & comfortable, plenty of hidden Mickeys & pixie dust. Mon & Tue are quiet days but after 1pm lines are between 30m   1hr, until then no more than 20m.Highlights   Gruzzly Gulch (Big Thunder Mountain), Mystic Manor & of course It   s A Small World.Prices for food & merch not bad, no worse than other Disney parks and relatively good compared to a sit down meal in HK.If you love Disney, you must come here.",5
"Stay till late for the light show & parade. Easy accessible by the MRT. We stayed at the hotel during our visit. Just like the other Disneyland, plan your rides n get the fast track ticket for the popular rides.",5
"Visited in march with my 4 year daughter, she really enjoyed , as kids of her age have plenty of attractions , and all age groups can enjoy the Disneyland,",5
"It was one of my wishes to visit disneyland and i was thrilled to visit it with my daughter. You are transported back to your childhood. The rides, characters, shows and mesmerising. My daughter loves the disney princess and we met almost all of them she was in a dreamworld. We had already met the characters in enchanted garden so we had enough time to see all the shows and rides. You need 2 days here to fully enjoy the park with kids. The experience starts right from the the disney mtr at sunny bay.",5
"you can find good rides in other amusement parks, but what really put Disney over and above the competition is that they're master storytellers and Disneyland lets you enter into of that world. it's spellbinding to kids and to adults.the only problem is that it's expensive. whether it's worth it or not is a bit of a subjective call. but it's pretty clear to me that Disney diddon't cheap out here.",5
A wonderful place to visit. It   s connected very well by the metro. Food is available: different cuisines definitely. I would recommend planning 2 days to visit if you want combine the     bibbidi bobbidi boutique experience     for your daughter. The rides are amazing. There   s definitely lots to explore. ,5
"It was fun to experience Hong Kong Disneyland, since I am a Floridian and have been to the Disney parks here in Florida many, many times.HK Disney has a lot of the same rides that the Orlando park has. Even the jungle ride cast member delivered the same joke that they use in their US parks. I love that you can get Dimsum and other Chinese food here.I enjoyed the parade. I loved the green toy soldiers, they marched perfectly to the beat despite their big leg piece and green paint. It was really a fun trip!",5
This park by far is one of the best Disneys to visit.  There were crowds but we did not ever feel as if we would miss out on a ride or attraction we wanted to see.  The Mystery Manor was one of the best attractions...More,5
It was pretty exciting to be there. You can spent hours just wondering about and the queue is very long to take photos with disney characters though. Not much of choice for food though and it is very expensive.,5
It was our fourth different disneyland park and the kids always love it. it is the smallest we have visited so far but the kids just love it. we spent five days and they kept going at lots of attractions multiple times.In march the weather...More,5
I just cadon't afford to pay those prices for a family   regardless of it being a one time experience!!!  The time we visited was when the prices were acceptable   and the park isdon't that great!,5
I have been to HK Disneyland for the third time and it never fails to thrill and amaze me and my daughter every time. We usually get our ticket from Klook because we can get a good discount and it's fuss free and very convenient. Our...More,5
This was one of the best experiences of lifetime .My son and I had an awesome time.There were a variety of rides not only for my son but also for me.,5
Will never get tired of visiting Disneyland over and over again.   Looking forward to the outcome of the ongoing renovations,5
"A very busy day,the theme park can be easily seen in one day you probably dodon't need a two day pass unless you have a family and you need the time for the kids.",5
"The last time I came here was when I was 10 and 13 years old. Since then, the park has improved drastically and received a lot of renovation. I think that the park looks really amazing and new now. Sadly, this time when I was there, there were no fireworks and the castle was under renovation. Other than that, the rides were really fun as well and I had a lot of fun there. The decorations were really interesting and neat too. The toilets were pristine and clean. I loves the overall experience. ",5
My 1 year old nephew enjoyed exploring disneyland. I loved my stay with my family and will visit again for sure!,5
"We almost went to all Disneyland parks and must say we like the one in Hong Kong as well. It   s the smallest of all but still very nice for a day. There are some things under construction (like the castle), so no firework show. But luckily there were still some parades and a lightshow. We had a very fun day! ",5
"This is our 2nd stay with Hong Kong Disneyland. Over the years the place has never disappoint us. The hotel is highly maintained, clean, shinning and happy. We highly recommend the Club Room as you will get priority passes for whole family (we finished all the main attractions in half a day thanks to these passes). The club lounge is also really great with a lot of food to choose from for the evening canap  s and breakfast. They have the mickey waffles and cookies !!The room is huge with a spacious balcony with very nice view of the sea. Just feel like sitting there for hours sipping coffee. Unfortunate the outdoor pool was closed and will reopen in April. They have a very nice slide for the kids. We spent a lot of time playing by the maze and super spacious and soft grass. Simply love it. ",5
"Best place to go to if you want to feel like a child again or have children accompanying you.  A good experience although I was not very happy with food outlets and options, more continental food would be appreciated. Rest was superb!",5
Though it's much smaller than Disneyland Tokyo it's still a very worth and excellent experience. It's even better that you dodon't need to rush for the rides.,5
"Disneyland is beautiful, magical, enjoyable!!! u relive ur childhood here...fantastic rides, great plays really staged well. The evening parade is just simply awesome.",5
Had a great day at Disneyland Hong Kong even allowing for the fact that their was torrential rain for first hour. Then it cleared and we had a great day I   ve been to Disney Paris and Florida and this would be smaller but still enjoyable ..We went at the beginning of the week so not to crowded. Shows and parade were good . Easy access on mtr . The earlier you go the better we were on the first group of people into the park which meant you were first for all the very popular rides. All in all a good day .. ,5
Not much of a Disneyland. Pretty disappointing. Go to Tokyo Disneyland instead. Tokyo Disney is the best.,5
"On the last day in Hong Kong before flying home (at midnight!) we decided to make the most of our time and visit Disney land. We are an English couple in our 30's and arrived and opening and left at closing after the final parade.It's very easy to get to on the MTR or by taxi   we stayed in Mong Kok and it was $200 (about   20) in a taxi and we got the train back which was about   5 for 2 people.There was plenty to see and do for all ages and the park is a really nice size where you can see most things in 1 day.There aredon't many thrill rides but the RC Car and Starwars ride were nice and fast and we went on a few time. Nice surprise was the Madhatters tea cups where you can manually control how fast it spins   probably my favorite ride of the day.Food options were really good and lots of things to buy. Fantastic way to maximise our last day, had a fantastic time.",5
"This was our first trip to an Asian Disneyland and we absolutely loved it! It contained every bit of the Disney magic, the shows were amazing and all the rides were good fun! Definitely worth a visit.",5
"This is the first Disneyland I've ever been to so I cadon't compare it with any other Disneylands, however, I enjoyed this place alot! Wear comfortable shoes and let this magical place take you away! Prepare to spend a whole day here if you're going to visit every single attraction. However I must say, if you dodon't have kids, I highly dodon't recommend  It's a small world  attraction. You'll get stuck in there for so long, I was about to fall asleep. Great for children though.",5
"I loved this smaller version of Disneyland. They had some really new and different rides, along with some of the older, traditional rides. We went at the end of Chinese new year and still the lines were not too bad, especially in the morning. I recommend you arrive prior to opening as the crowds were really light at that time of day.Being from the US, it was pretty much what I expected...same Disney feel, Asian food of course which was great. We stayed about half the day and we were able to ride most of the attractions. Attractions like the Jungle Cruise were done in several different languages, you just need to get in the line for english speakers is that's your language.",5
Way less crowded than in Tokyo but much smaller. The fun rides for teens like Space Mountain and Mine ride had relatively short queues. Iron Man 4d was not bad too and there is a pretty fun ride in Toy Story land too. The rest of the rides are for kids like Mystic Manor but not bad either. Tip would be to go early when it opens around 10am before the larger crowds come. ,5
Was very lucky to be able to spend my birthday in Disney during our visit. We went on a Sunday and it was surprisingly busy considering it was February.Loved how the park was set out and lots of different things compared to the other Disney parks.Mystic manor was amazing also the Grizzly Gulch are was so well themed. The castle was unfortunately boarded up which we knew before so the fireworks were not on the night we were there. Both the parades were lovely and the staff were so organised and polite to everyone.So glad I got to experience the park and would definately recommend for all disney fans.,5
I had been here in November 2017. I felt like a kid all over again. It's a must place for the kiddies. The parade and fire works were superb.,5
"I went here twice with my teenage daughters and their friends, both times on a weekend. Amazingly we were able to ride all the rides were wanted, last time even twice a couple of them. The longest wait time was 30min. This is so much better in comparison to Disney in USA where you could stand 60 to 90 min line! Note we do always come early, right after it opens so I'm sure this helps however we stay until about 4pm to watch the parade which is very cute and uplifting. The food is of course quite expensive everywhere but decent. And plenty of opportunities to satisfy sweet cravings with ice cream, waffles, churros and more. Of course there are plenty of souvenir shops to buy gifts for everyone : ) Overall I really like how this Disneyland is compact so you could go around it in a half day, no stress and no huge crowds (of course this is Hong Kong so people are everywhere still but not crazy). Definitely worth a visit with kids or even for adults to just have fun! ",5
"A great day out. Lots to see and do for all ages. As in most cases there in often huge lines for popular rides, but they do let you know before entering the time to wait before you can get on the rides. The Disney story time musical is a must see. Food was pricey. ",5
"First time coming here with my girls from NYC, we have a wonderful experience, Everything was so nice, my girls very happy,  I try to go back in this Summer vacation 2018",5
"It was a very wonderful holiday after I had a competition. The rides were very spectacular. The favourite snack there was a squid with chili. The ride areas were very clean. The servers were very professional and very kind. It was a little bit crowded inside, but the Disneyland show was very wonderful. You should go there, trust me you will be surprised to see all the spectacular views. Anyway, it wasdon't too expensive to get inside.",5
Highly recommend you go and visit during Chinese New Year   it was fantastic! Lots of pictures on my Instagram @DisneyDuckLover if you want to see!,5
One of the popular tourists spot in Hong Kong. Kids will enjoy everything even if it is tiring to walk in this place. A lot of things to see    ,5
Now I know why its called the happiest place on earth! It was easy to get to coming from the cit and I loved the train going there. Only downside is everything was so expensive!,5
Hong Kong Disney is a must for Disney fans. It is very easy and inexpensive to get there by subway and to transfer and ride the special disney train is a delight and it stops at the front gate. This park is much cheaper than the parks in the U.S. and senior citizens get even a better deal.,5
Very nice place to go by subway for a day during visit to Hong Kong.In our case was last day excursion and best way to say bye to our southeast vacation trip.It is not big park but good attractions and was posible to enter several times to best ones.We really enjoyed journey.,5
"Had so much fun here!! Bought our tickets online to skip the queue and highly suggest for you to do too as well! Go for the reliable ones! I also suggest to dedicate one whole day for this attraction as there are lots of rides and attractions to see!Rides wise, I think the ones who would enjoy them the most are young kids as they are not as intense as those from Universal Studios, quite obviously.",5
"Loved, loved this park. Can easily get round it in one day and had rides that no other Disney park does   just a shame Mistic Manor wasn   t open.  If you are in Hong Kong and like Disney, this is a must!",5
"The tickets for Disneyland seems to increase. Rides there are more for children. The roller coaster are not scary as well. I like Grizzly Bear and RC racer. The souvenir shops are packed with people and it's quite expensive. A pen cost over $10. I'm a huge fan of stitch but there isdon't much stitch apparels ):Well, it is a great place for family. It's smaller than the one in Tokyo as well.",5
"Rides are pretty much catered to young children, not so much for thrill seekers.If you prefer thrilling rides, you can visit Ocean Park theme park. FYI, I   m a thrill seeker.Rides I enjoyed in HK Disneyland are: Big Grizzly Mountain (indoor roller coaster) and Space Mountain and RC racer.A pity they stopped the fireworks beginning this 1st Jan 2018.",5
We always can be happy if we inside disneyland area.. full of happiness over there.. all the staff very kind.. the music was the mood booster.. my little son was so happy playing around disneyland.. so many attractions and so many disney figures.. never been bored go to disneyland..,5
Not as big as expected but will definitely consumed your entire day. You'll definitely feel young the moment you step foot on this place. The place will channel the inner child in you. :) Every rides attractions will stop during the parade and will resume operations after. Do not miss the fireworks show too.Expect the food and even the smallest item in their gift shops to be pricey. You cannot bring outside food snacks inside the park. The cheapest bottled water you could buy in the park is located at the entrance besides a gift shop.,5
"Hong Kong Disneyland is smaller than most Disneylands in the world, but, no matter, one can still have a lot of fun. Disneyland is Disneyland, after all! My favourite part is Adventureland. For Halloween, they usually have it dark and spooky with lots of ghosts and goblins. ",5
"What more can I say   Disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth! Despite being opened for more than a decade, the place is still really well kept. The fast pass made our visit a whole lot more efficient and convenient. Queue times were short (except maybe for the phototaking with the characters). Hugeeee variety in the stores which kept us shopping non stop! Rides were fantastic as well. Character interactions were superb. And of course the best part was the parade. We caught the day and night parades and both were fantastically great!",5
"You'll feel like a kid again, abit expensive but worth the trip. I would suggest to eat at the fairytale banquet hall (near dumbo) and buy a klook food coupon online, hell of a lot cheaper.",5
Together with Ocean Park in Hong Kong that make it balance between classics attraction and the Model one. The size is appropriate and can enjoy for one day walking trip. Have resort hotel and restraints inside.,5
It is not a big disneyland but we love it so much! We all enjoy our visit. Merchandise in their shops are actually betther than the ones in Tokyo. We will definitely come back. The kids love it!,5
"This is the smallest Disneyland in the world, with only 5 worlds (1 was closed during our visit). The line was decent, and the attractions are relatively modern (updated). Would recommend if you're already in HK, but would not make this a destination for coming to HK.",5
"Initially I thought what would I do there, its for kids. I was their because of my girl friend. And Thank God i went there. This place is for grown us too. I was not surprised why kids are crazy fir this. Its a huge set up I must say. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Especially the roller coaster ride. It was great. Highly recommend. I will be back. Thanks",5
"Nice place to go and share with the family. We enjoying the games and the activities . For holiday, this place is excellent. Buy tickets along with meal vouchers is recommended, saving money. Although fireworks no longer performed, because of construction. We still had good time. Want to go there again.",5
"This is the perfect place for young ones and young at hearts to enjoy and just have fun. Just a walk and a picture here and there will make your visit memorable and meaningful. Went here with a toddler to breastfeed and I was so glad that they have a dedicated baby care area. Though long lines are everywhere, it is still worth to queue just to take the ride or have a photo. Photopass is included in our package but wasn   t able to maximize it because of the lines. The spookey parade(halloween time when we visited) was not suitable for toddlers. Perfect if you stay at disneyland hotel.",5
If you have ever been to Disneyland Paris it is the same but a shrunken down version. The good thing about this is that you can do basically everything in one day. We went and it was Chinese new year. the cast had special outfits and the whole thing was great. It cost around   60 to get in but was definitely worth it. ,5
"We went to hk Disney 5 Years ago and was disappointed but it seems to be a lot better. More rides and attractions. If you don   t have an octopus card, buy a return train ticket as you get off at Disney. Trust me when I say the line can be worse to get out than in . Get there a little bit earlier. We arrived at 930 and had no delays getting into the park.if you can buy (fast pass easy pass) tickets already along with your entry. Yes a little more money but well worth it. Every body has there own likes but the iron man and Star Wars rides are great. Even some of the rides shows that we weren   t really interested in , we went on(because of fast pass tickets) and surprisingly we enjoyed them. At around lunch time  1oclock it starts to get really busy, so be prepared. Food stalls and seats become very busy. My suggestion is to eat very big breakfast and wait until later afternoon to eat",5
"Second time here, mostly because it's just a short plane ride away.Lines can get long, but if you get a package that includes a hotel stay, things get a LOT more enjoyable and more convenient.While at the park, I highly suggest downloading the HK Disneyland App for alerts and maps.",5
"My husband and I had an  extra  day in Hong Kong and decided to visit Disneyland. We've been to the US Disney locations and have enjoyed them. This Disneyland is much smaller (land in Hong Kong is terribly expensive) but was the park was nice, pure Disney. The attractions are mostly geared toward smaller children but the park is well maintained and easily do able in a single day if you use FastPass. (You get 3 Fast Passes with a general admission ticket). The Lion King theater show was particularly good. Best of all, a regular ticket is about $75 US, and if you are over 65 it is about $13 US. We were even there during the Chinese New Year Holiday and found the park crowded, but no more so than any of the US parks on a holiday weekend.",5
My girlfriend is a massive Disney fan so I booked a day there. A full day of fun with great shows and fantastic experiences. I recommend using the fast passes when available. Fun for all the family.,5
"The dilemma:Whether to take the two day pass or one day pass? Looking at reviews feedback, I took one day pass. In hindsight, it was a wrong decision. I went with a 8 year old kid and her pace is not the same as mine. With a 2 day pass, I could have covered all the rides in a relaxed manner. The cost of two day pass is only little bit more than one day pass and it is a good deal.Positives:  Paint the night parade is superb.  This was my first Disneyland trip. I realized that Disneyland is not about high tech rides. Much more thrilling high tech rides can be had in any big city around the world. Disneyland is about carefully curated fantasy. It is not to be rushed through but savoured slowly. The 19th century USA ambience is created beautifully with attention to details. Roaming through these does not need any queue.  Once paint the night parade is over, one can return to city by MTR or taxi. There are folks at taxi stand (possibly Disneyland staff) who really help.Negatives:  I wish some people could have taken things a bit more easy. It should not be about ticking away a bucket list of rides, cutting queues, covering most rides in minimum time. I can understand the excitement of kids but I cannot understand the impatience of parents. Why create the unnecessary scarcity mentality?",5
"Disneyland does not disappoint. As it should be, plenty of activities and attractions and rides. However, one advantage compared to Orlando is that it is compact but still not crowded. It dodon't take too long to walk from one side to the other.",5
"When you are Disneyland, you really gotta  fight  with those tourists from Mainland China. They do not queue most of the time. Goodness. They might just cut your queue. But, what to do? Will not stoop to their level. Anws, we are there to enjoy the rides. Enjoyed the fireworks at night. There were really a lot of people who stayed behind for this. And be there early, and choose a good spot to watch the performances. Food is quite expensive over there, but..I guess it's  normal  for such attractions. There are vegetarian and halal options too.",5
"Plan to Disney on 16 03 2018. If I booked Disneyland Hotel, does it come with tickets entree to Disneyland park?",5
"compare to other Disneyland around the world, you will actually enjoy the fun here , most important is not so many people in here . Not like Shanghai Disneyland , will waiting for 2 hours for one facilities . In here , you will have chance choose using fast pass to avoid the long queue . even more , if you stayed Disneyland resort , they will offer more fast pass and no limited in which particular games . I am 30 yrs old and son is nearly 3 yrs old both of us enjoy play around here .",5
"Before you even arrive (by train) you start on the Disney journey with the Disney train. What a great day. My husband and I and our 2 children (aged 16 years and 12 years) had a fun filled day. It was drizzling on and off the day we went but that diddon't spoil our fun. The crowds weredon't too big   we went on a Friday, so the lines weredon't too long. Both children had a great time, as did the adults.",5
"You cadon't get enough of this place.... It is magical.... Although when we visited, it was raining and it was freezing cold, but still it diddon't dampen the spirits of the people working there who were smiling all the time... The rides were equally sweet and enjoyable.... You might have to wait a lot to meet Mickey and Minnie but it will all be worth it. Get the booking done online and try to get a two day pass if you want to enjoy this place thoroughly.... It is beautiful and everyone enjoys.. Be it your young kids or teenager... We had an amazing time.... ",5
Not to visit on weekends   I suggest never to visit on weekends as there is a long queue for every swing or adventure,5
"HK Disneyland is well known as Disney   s oldest theme park in Asia.. but this place still looks interesting, especially for a first timer visitor like me, even this place wasn   t really that big, but it still interesting to explore! I love toy story land, tommorowland, and their shopping arcade, feels like 60s in USA...and one more thing... Christmas is the best season ever to visit this place!",5
"A fantastic place for a family holiday. There is something for everyone ranging from adventure, nature, parks, gardens, fun rides, roller coaster rides, 4D theatres and the like. Amenities such as restaurants, food kiosks and cafes are aplenty. Be prepared to walk long distances from the time you disembark the MRT line to the actual site; though there is plenty to see along the way. Book beforehand on Klook to get a discount. Do not miss the Ironman, Star Wars rides and the 4D theatre experience.",5
"Disneyland Hongkong resort is very great,,it has so many rides to try,and the fireworks is very beautiful,i hope i can visit to the Disneyland hongkong resort again.",5
"Great place for kids and adults. We visited on a Sunday and the place was not too crowded. Attractions were fun, weather was great, kids had a lot of fun. Everything is withing close walking distance   very convenient for a family with stroller. Hong Kong Disneyland is probably the cheapest of all Disneylands. ",5
"Hong Kong Disneyland is fast becoming our favorite. It is our 3rd visit and each visit is indeed magical. Halloween, Christmas, Chinese New Year! Name the ocassion and they have it in grand presentation. Even parents will fell children. I love their new Iron Man Experience! Will visit again as soon as possible!",5
"Disneyland Hongkong is very attractive theme park. It is a must see attraction if you are in Hongkong. Children will love to visit. Several attractions are there for kids. I will suggest to buy Disney Souvenirs should be purchased from any market in city. If you purchase it from Disneyland it will cost very high. So better purchase any rain coat, umbrella or Disney cap outside of the Disneyland. Fast pass price has several benefits. it saves time. If you are with little kids you may need fast pass because on most of the rides there is a lot of rush. so kids either get irritated in long queues or they miss some rides. Tips for visitors:1) Avoid visiting on sundays or holidays. There will be a lot of rush. Local tourism is china is very high. Locals visit to these attractions so try to avoid visiting on holidays or festival days to save your time and visit with peace of mind. 2) Go to the place as early as possible. Early in the morning there is no rush so if you want to enjoy all rides without fast pass you can do it easily. Fast pass price is very high Disney should slash the price.",5
"We absolutely loved Disneyland, as did our kids (9,10,14). We had spent a day at Ocean Park the day before and had read that it was better than Disney, so were a little worried, but nothing could be further from the truth.We'd also been to Paris Disney, and this is absolutely comparable. The Disney experience with the Asian touch is really spectacular. I'd recommend making the most of the fast pass, which you can use once at every ride (no additional cost).We were able to get through the entire park in one day, but it was a very busy day   non stop. The food isdon't great, and typically over priced, but that wasdon't surprising.The rides are all great   favourites were Iron Man experience and Grizzly Mountain Mine Cars.",5
"We visit HK Disneyland Jan 18 and I must say I can   t imagine a better time to visit. It wasn   t busy so ride waits were a max of 5 minutes, 10 minutes at worse, or no wait at all. Great selection of attractions, I was like an excited little kid. The train to Disneyland was also Disneyland themed so that was nice. The great part was how easy it was to get to on the train. I preferred this over Tokyo Disneyland ",5
"Disney Land was a great time to spend with grandaughter, rides great even for oldies. Get a 2 day pass as you will need it and stay for the Parade. take snacks with you as when your in the queue for rides kids get restless and hungry. The shows are a must to see.",5
"Every every nook and corner is a delight, a pleasure, a world away from the one we live in. We all,  family  loved and enjoyed all the activities, the visuals, the parade, the lion king show and were dying to repeat everything.",5
Go to Disneyland early morning so you can enjoy all day. We regret that we came after lunch.   Happiest place on Asia! I must try other disneylands in other countries,5
"Disney Land is a must for all Hong Kong travellers. It takes you back to your childhood. Seeing the fairytale stories come to life is breathtaking. Everything is done with excellence. From the parade to the shops, displays theme parks etc, its out of this world. The park is managed very well everything is in place. The security manages the crowds very well and efficiently. A definate must for all visitors to Hong Kong. ",5
"Been several times to Disneyland and trust me this is the only Disneyland where I could finish all the rides in one day. The park wasdon't that big. But still fabulous and enjoyable. I went there last Christmas, the longest waiting time to take the ride was only 30 mins...this is quick compared to my previous visit to Japan (2 hours!) Make sure to take notes on the show time. All I can remember is LION KING at 12pm. Food was okay, not many choice but OK. Waiting time was also not long. So everyone was happy then.My fav ride: mining roller coaster...forgot the name, it is located in the jungle land area close to Lion King.Also, they provide rental for stroller. However it is not for infant. Maybe for kids starting from 1.5 years old.",5
Not a Disney fan but after visiting I had changed my mind. It is truly a magical place. My 2 years old boy did enjoy and had a good experience,5
"This was our second visit to Hong Kong Disneyland, the first one being in December 2010 and it was a pleasure to experience the new rides and shows. The best part about Disney is that it never disappoints no matter how high your expectations are set at! We took the 2 day Play and Shop package which I believe is only available online and is serious value for money. You can make the second visit anytime within 6 or 7 days of the first visit! My parents who are close to 70 basically paid only 100 HKD per person per day which is 1 6 of an adult ticket price. The kids loved almost all the rides and characters. Food options could be better but then who goes to Disneyland to eat? Get to the park 15 minutes before it opens and start from the Adventure Land side. We did that on day 1 and it worked better than the other way around that we tried on the second visit. We skipped weekends. Do not miss the parades (there are 2 in a day, both totally different), Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Manor, Space Mountain and Iron Man rides especially if you have kids over 10 with you. Highly recommend shows such as 1) Mickey and the Wondrous book and 2) Phillar magic! Its a small world is good for older people and is generally not too busy. Have fun and let Disney bring out the child in you again!",5
"There really is not much more to say about HK disneyland. Like all disneyland, it is the happiest place on earth, you getto meet all the disney characters at randon and at different times of the day. I guess the only difference is the language during the show. So make sureyou catch the english version, althou, if you get to watch the cantonese version, they do have small screens on both side of the stage where they flash the subtitles",5
It's been about 2 years since my last visit and I was pleasantly surprised to see more rides and attractions added. The level and quality of entertainment offered continues to be of a high standard.,5
"We travelled to Disneyland and stayed in Hong Kong Disneyland hotel for 3 nights. The first night at Kingdom club room and followed by 2 days in Deluxe room. Our kids loved the Story Telling session and Mickey   s appearance in pyjamas before bed in the club level. One of the perks for staying in the Kingdom Club, truly amazing experience. We left our kids lunch box in the fridge in the Kingdom Club. When we are back to our Deluxe room, the Club   s housekeeping was so kind enough to put the lunch box into our new room fridge. (contains our kids cheese). We also got the luggage shifted to our Deluxe room. Very convenient and thoughtful.When I reached the hotel after the park day 1, we also got surprised with 2 Mickey Mouse plush toys, a bunch of Helium Balloons, birthdays cards from Mickey, cake decor with towels and decorations in our rooms.Our kids (son and daughter) loved the plush soft toy from the    Three Magical Days    package. Our daughter wanted a Minnie Mouse and when I asked the front desk helped me to changed it, it was changed immediately without any queries. My daughter was so excited and she was sleeping hugging the Minnie the whole night.We were late from the Disney park after the Night parade and headed to Walt   s cafe for dinner. We have been provided food and table at around 10 pm without any hassle. The staff and the restaurant was so efficient and fast and also very knowledgeable in the menu. The staff also advised me about the dinner promotion of discount of $100 for $400 minimum spend. We   ve got that discount and a great dinner. On the last day of stay, we enjoyed the Character breakfast dining with Pluto, Goofy, Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Definitely a lifetime experience for all.",5
"My grandson, all 2yrs old of him, arrived from Australia and says    Can I see Mickey daddyLo?    Who can say    No    to little boy   s requests?Off we went to HongKong Disneyland, the nearest place where Mickey lives. It was a showery morning on an unusually cold day in Hongkong when we arrived. After checking in our hotel we went to see Disneyland starting from one of the most famous street of merriment in the entertainment world, Main street. This street is well known for all who have visited Disneyland in any part of the world. For those who are planning to make a visit to Disney, this is the street where Mickey & Minnie, Pluto & Buzz and all the Disney characters perform their much anticipated parade at an appointed time where most if not all visitors lined up both sides of the street to watch all these famous characters walk and dance in choreography. Much has been published in this wonderful place where the child within all of us savor and enjoy the nostalgic moments of our own idealized world of childhood.",5
"Well, I was pretty impressed with HK Disney. I love Toy Story Land and the attractions there. The Big Grizzly Mountain Mine Cars here is way better than the ones in LA and Orlando.The park is smaller compared to its counterparts in the US but you do only pay $70 (make sure to buy tickets through Klook). I visited on New Year's day and the park was pretty empty! Disney is working on Cinderella's Castle so there are no fireworks (my favorite Disney 'attraction')",5
"Your typical Disney park, except a bit smaller.  The attractions, restaurants and shops will keep you busy for an entire day.  A  must  for all aged 18 and under, and definitely enjoyable for those older!",5
Had a great with our teenagers here   the park was quiet (we went on a Friday)   not much queuing and lines moved quickly. Quite small and not great if you are after the big roller coasters but plenty to keep us there all day.,5
"I've never been to any of the Disneyland. It was my first time I visited the place in Hongkong, The place is very happening, beautiful and well designed, the time you step you into the place, you will get into the delightful memories of your childhood. I went to the place during Christmas which made my experience better. The place is very crowded so I recommend to take a 2 day pass if you are planning to go especially on weekends or public holidays so you can enjoy the most of it. Dodon't forget to attend the evening firework and Disney parade. They have dedicated mobile applications which will give you an idea about the timetable and wait time on rides.",5
HK Disneyland is small as compared to US one but it is worth it. This is a must visit for a child(once in a lifetime). The shows and Parades should not be missed. The Iron man Experience is a new addition which should be in a must do list.The characters at Main Street looks so real and reminds us of very fond memories of the past.Travel in a weekday to avoid the queue and rush.,5
Maybe my fault go to Tokyo Disney before HK Disney;  So not so surprise for us when go to HK Disney ....,5
avoid the busy days small park with plenty to do v organised parkfantastic hotelskids paradiseuse octopus for train stops right at the park with a 5 min walk to entrancecharacters even go to hotels and dive in the pools goofey going down the slide with my kids was a great pic!!!!,5
"You must spend the whole day in hear. A lot of fun things to do. Food and snacks available almost everywhere include souvenir shops. A lot of nice stuffs to buy, but be careful, do not buy to much..you have to carry them all day. I buy only tiny things that I can put in my backpack.. Evening fireworks show is so adorable.",5
"Try to come as early as you can, as you will need one whole day to enjoy all attraction here.No worry to bring some snacks or mineral water inside, they dodon't really strict on the inspection.We visited on early December, the weather was perfect, no rain and only 16 18 degree.Dodon't forget to enjoy their evening parade.No age limitation to enjoy this park for sure!",5
No matter whats your age.. this place has got it for you. The visit makes you feel as if you are in a fairyland that you only dreamed of. Most of the rides are kids safe and full of adult adrenaline :),5
"We had a blast.. nothing more to report other than it was awesome, perfect size part form young children.. We have done DisneyLand California and this park is considerably smaller and easy to accomplish with young children.",5
"Disneyland Hongkong is neat ,clean & well planned area where both kids &adults can enjoy the whole day, Hyperspace mountain, iron man show mystic manor and other rides give you feeling of adventure & enjoyment.  some restaurants are providing even veg meals.",5
"Disneyland Hong Kong is spotlessly clean, well laid out and great fun. we visited with friends & their families. We enjoyed the whole day esp Hyperspace mountains, Iron man show , Mystic Manor,& other rides Disney Parade was enjoyable",5
Awesome place for kids and adults to enjoy. Amazing rides and live shows for all. Quite a few gift shops which are a little expensive as expected and restaurants as well.Must watch the Lion King Show and Disney storybook and Philhar magic 3D show. Must ride the Grizzly cart and space cart in TomorrowlandDodon't miss the night and afternoon parades and of course take pics with the characters(though there will be long queues),5
"So happy finally i can experience xmast season in one of Disney parks. One tick for my wish list :) The xmast decoration was superb and the weather was unpleasantly great (not too freezing cold).We bought our tickets for 2 days park ahead of time online and with the meal package and the bubble wand . First we attacked the Mickey Waffle, our all time fave before we headed out to the rides. Enjoy the Iron Man Ride and Hyperspace Mountain..Love the Christmas show in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle during daytime and the Firework during night time.. We r fortunate enough to see the castle in full view cause they start a full renovation this January. We had lunch at the Royal Banquet Hall and also dinner at Plaza Inn.. both are very nice and recommendable .. and also at Explorer's Club Resto near the Mystic Manor.Mystic Manor was a fun ride .. My lil girl lovesss the Fairy Tale Forest... it's a must see and go place for every little girl who loves Disney Princesses... u can only find it at HKD.The indoor show we love so much is the Mickey Wondrous Book Show...it was so great.. we enjoyed it immensely.Last but not least, we sit down nicely for our Disney Paint the Night Parade where my boy was ecstatic to see Lightning McQueen comes alive . What a wonderful memory we had at HK Disneyland",5
"Hong Kong Disneyland is smaller than others I have been to, and has less rides. However, on our weekday winter visit, it was uncrowded with short queues for everything so we could get around it all in a day.",5
It's very joyful place.kids loved it so much . the light show at night so wonderful..dodon't miss it.go early for the rides as it is getting crowded afternoon..,5
"We went for our honeymoon and it was such a great treat to be here, I just love Disneyland, we were there for a complete day and enjoyed every bit of it, the rides were amazing, specially grizzly gultch, The fireworks made our day pretty beautiful and not to forget the the Disney characters parade, which was awesome..",5
Lovely weather! I was shocked at how it wasn   t that busy as we went on the 30th December!!The park is separated from the rest of Hong Kong so I recommend staying on site if you can. It is also probably the cheapest Disneyland for both tickets and accommodation.,5
"We love Disneyland! It truly is the happiest place on earth and makes me feel like a kid again. We went with young kids and teenagers, and everyone had fun. Although it   s small in comparison to Disney World, I think Disneyland Hong Kong is relatively the same size as Magic Kingdom. We went in December and we enjoyed seeing all the Christmas decorations.My recommendation is to go when park opens to beat the crowds. Ride your preferred rides early in the day as there are only 3 rides you can fast pass then you   ll have to stand in long lines. We ate lunch at Maxim, which was yummy.Overall it was a magical day!",5
"Easy to get to via the MTR system, Disneyland isdon't cheap unless you are a Senior Citizen, when a Day ticket is just $100hkd, very good value if you're in your 2nd. childhood. Iron Man and Grizzly Gulch were both brilliant, whole park is very clean, and you dodon't need to be a long distance athlete to go all the way round it, it's reasonably compact without feeling that everything is packed too tightly together. The attraction very much exceeded our expectations, we'd happily go back if somebody can get us to Hong Kong again !! ",5
We had just visit this place this month.  A variety of venue available.  We see the Parade at the afternoon.  So many choices for friends and family.,5
"Happy happy place for kids... It's beautiful and fun... So many things to enjoy and so little time... One day is not enough.. Fantasy land, toy story land, adventure land, tomorrow land, etc etc... Much more to explore... But do expect long queues everywhere... Spoils the fun... ",5
Park is really great. You can spend all day there. Ticket costs 619 HKD. In application Klook I bought it for 501 HKD using promo code PKU6F (it gives additional discount 25 HKD),5
A great couple of days for the Kids we grabbed the 2 day pass the first day we arrived early & it was wet & miserable weather wise. Which meant we diddon't have to wait for any rides the only down side was the parade was an inclement weather parade with characters on a float singing & dancing as it went past only a small version of the full parade. The second day the weather was better we arrived latter & had to wait 10 15 minutes for rides at most we saw the full parade at 3:30 Pm which the kids loved. & continued on rides until the light up the night parade which was spectacular. There were no fireworks over the castle as they were in the middle of som renovation in that area. The MTR is so easy to use & efficient mode of transportation to get there & back. All in all a must do in Hong Kong with kids. ,5
We have a two day ticket but will only return if we need a slower day with the kids before we leave HK. It would be nice to go back if we can but we won   t feel like we   ve missed out as we packed it...More,5
"My first visit 7 years ago was good, but I remembered that I was done by 3 pm, meaning the rides must have not been too engaging and the place was smaller compared to the other Disneylands.This trip our group arrived at almost 11am to no queue at the ticket booths. We got our tickets slightly cheaper on Klook, but we wanted physical tickets as souvenir so we had to do exchange at the ticket booths. Oh, it is so worth it for senior persons to visit Disneyland Hong Kong at HKD100 only! Super envious!Same thing for the meal vouchers. We bought on Klook cheaper compared to buying on site which was HKD235 for the 3 in 1 meal coupons. Absolutely worth it to buy this deal as you get to exchange for set meals of prices HKD120 & above each for lunch & dinner, plus a snack. The Mickey Minnie ice cream will cost you HKD39 & popcorn HKD32 35. You do the math! We never even got to use the HKD5 discount for water coupon, as we got bottled water with the set meals anyways (if you dodon't take soda, coffee tea add HKD10).All the attractions were great fun and our most recommended would be:1) Mystic Manor (the only one in the world!)2) Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh3) Mickey's Philharmonic4) It's a Small World5) Slinky Dog Spin6) Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (not for the faint hearted!)We covered more than 11 attractions right up to the fireworks at 8.30pm. If u want more time for the rides & to shop, u shud arrive once the park opens. After 4pm, the queues were noticeably shorter. Overall, we didnt have to queue more than 30mins per attraction.As for food, if you have the 3 in 1 meal coupons, just head to Royal Banquet Hall for lunch & Explorer's Club for dinner. Big portion & excellent choices & taste!Have a fun day out at the Happiest Place on Earth!",5
Must visit place if you go to Hong Kong. Very nice and big situated in hongkong you can go by mrt and Disney metro train. No word to describe Disneyland. Must watch Firework and Parade. Should go early if you want to ride every ride.,5
Disneyland Hong Kong is a must visit if you bring kids while travel to Hong Kong.  Make sure to browse on the internet to find cheaper tickets before and to avoid long queue at the entrance.,5
"Came here for the 2nd time, now with my 3 years old boy who really enjoy the park, the carnival and show.We came during Christmas holiday. It was really packed! If you prefer to enjoy most area of the park & the rides, holidays season might not be best time for that. Queue for the ride is long and took 45 min   1 hr. But for my young son who just love to look around, its not a problem. A small tips that useful for us. If you come by MTR during the peak season and you dont have the octopus card, you may want to purchase the return train ticket when you arrive, just to make sure you dodon't need to queue on the vending machine when you about to go back : )",5
A must experience for all first timer (even 2nd or 3rd) in Hong Kong. The parade and the fire works are great and a must wait and see for all visitors. Worth the pricey cost. Offered a huge discount for senior citizen even though they come from different country... ,5
"This was by far the most memorable trip for my daughter..worth every penny..we were there on 01 Jan 18, the last day of the fireworks before it was closing for an year..the rides and the character meetings are top class..a very compact and well maintained park",5
 the most anticipated tour in Hong Kong for my kids and I was the visit to Hong Kong Disney land. Had loads of fun and kids enjoyed a lot.There are a lot of fun games and the whole atmosphere is just so inviting and great. ,5
Spent 8 hours here had so much fun I went around New Year   s Eve time and the lines weren   t very long! The fast pass that is free really helps out! The lines were way smaller then Disneyland Tokyo and was not nearly as crowded! The food selection was also good especially as one of us is vegetarian. Always such a magical place!,5
Great experience through the day. By using the Disneyland App you can save time and plan you visit in more efficiency. The kids had great time and it is surely a must site for both adults and families.,5
Good place for my boy. A lot of Choice playing arena. Nice place. A lot of peoples come  on Desember. Snow shows in the Night,5
"We went there 29 30 December 2017, staying in one of the Disney hotel helped a lot because we just took shuttle bus and visit the parks in the morning and comeback and rest in the afternoon before head back for firework and night attraction. Our favorite attractions are Big Grizzly Mountain and Parachute drop, highly recommended. Parades were great as usual, especially Xmas theme related shows. Firework was also second to none. The only point that I kinda dislike was F&B in terms of price, long line to purchase, and taste was just decent. However, you can bring your own food and drink inside as long as you carry them with your backpack.Tips:1. Go there early, and go inside to Toy story zone first so that you can enjoy attractions then walk back up front for other attractions and parades.2. Like other Disneyland, foods and drinks are allowed as long as you can carry in your backpack (luggage with wheels is not allowed) Thus, bring food and drink so that you save some money.3. Use fast pass, when possible and also you should download Disneyland Hong Kong app (very useful because it tells you how long you have to wait for each attraction) 4. Buy Ticket online before go to park so that you can skip ticket line (line was long during our visit)Hope you will have great time here ^ ^",5
"We were there on Haloween for two days and had a great time, the rides, the shows, the parades, everything is just mesmerizing.",5
"Went to HK Disneyland for Christmas and part of town hall is under renovation, however, great tree lighting ceremony and new attraction such as Iron Man Experience is great. Managed to watch Storybook tales and it was fantastic. Lines were manageable on normal days (not weekend) however the lines to meet and greet with characters are incredibly long or they really have very short time. Did not manage to take picture with anyone for 2 day visit.",5
"Spent my 30th Birthday here and had a wonderful time, well organized and great attractions.  We came early on a weekday and didn   t have to wait in line for anything.",5
We have been to the US Disneys several times and while Hong Kong is small in comparison I would recommend the experience. The rides are different. They have Toy Story Land and Mystic Manor which we have not seen anywhere else. The merchandise and badges are different and it is exciting to experience the differences. Fantastic local food on offer everywhere. ,5
"The park is separated from the rest of Hong Kong so I recommend staying on site if you can. It is also probably the cheapest Disneyland for both tickets and accommodation.But it   s not lacking in attractions. We visited during Halloween, the Villains night time parade was spectacular, the temporary haunted house was great, but probably for bigger kids.Highlights included the IronMan Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, Jedi Training, and Grizzly Gulch. Other attractions are still great, though the long line for the Winnie the Pooh is somewhat weird, I recommend using he fast pass system for that one.Food was good, thankfully, as there are no breakfast other options. We had a quick service at tomorrow land which was filling and great Value at HK$99 for a meal. And a nice meal in the Main Street Restaurant which was pricey HK$660 for two but still very nice.It is warm during the day, but most lines are in the shade or air conditioned except for the smaller rides eg Orbitron and Dumbo. And It   s a small World is always worth the effort.We got a free fast pass for staying at the hotel. Nice perk.English is not everyone   s first language, the cast do a great job communicating though.The cast members are impeccable they take their role seriously, especially in the Jedi training.",5
"Happiest Place on earth so true. We were a group of 7 ppl 4 elderly above age 55 2adults n a kid aged 6, and what fun it was for all. Everyone loved the HK Fisneyland experience. But since it was 30 th Dec and a weekend the place was too busy, there were huge crowds every where. The park is divided in the following areasMain Street USA  Just at the entrance is the Train station which takes you to Fantasy Land. Also the parade happens at the Main Street. For th fireworks you need to take a place on the Main Street in front of the sleeping beauty castle. Adventure Land   has Alison King show, Jungle river cruise, rafts to Tarzan   s tree house, etcGrizzly Gulch   is a thrilling roller coasterMystic Point   Mystic Manor, Garden of wondersToy Story Land   RC Racer for thrill seekers, Slinky dog soon for kidsFantasyland   Sleeping Beauty Castle, Micky Philharmonic Magic show, etc. This is one of the biggest areas in the park. Tomorrowland   Hyperspace Mountain for thrill seekers, Iron Man Experience again for thrill seekers (I missed it though)",5
I love here. There are many things to do here.   Be noted that it's clouded every where here with all games and teaters.   To purcase the fast track is recommended.  Stay until late to see the fire work.  Iron man is value to wait.,5
"We stayed at the Disneyland hotel and it was worth every penny spent. The restaurants were amazing, the rooms were kept clean all the time, the staff were very friendly. The highlight was how they ushered in the New Year with spectacular performances by the Disney characters and other local celebs. The highlight for the kids was having breakfast with Mickey, Minnie and Pluto. They were so jazzed. However I would like to request if the hotel can add French fries to the room service menu as it is just as easy to prepare. All in all I would happily revisit the hotel. Thank you to the entire team!!",5
I had the most amazing time at Hong Kong Disneyland!! Lovely weather! I was shocked at how it wasn   t that busy as we went on the 30th December!! Went on every ride and didn   t queue for more than 35 40mins. Attractions were loads of fun. Nice food. Staff were happy. Just the perfect Disneyland trip. Thankyou!,5
"Excellent park to visit, especially during Dec weather. Is cooling and windy. All food inside was good.",5
"This Disney is great forthe younger family, it has a handful of exciting rides that you 7 year old will go crazy for while still keepingnyour 11 year old excited. Its easy to get around and has all the magical feeling you expect from Disney. Big tip is get there for opening time around 10am as its the quietest time and youwill have the shortest wait times. Also plan our your use of the fastpass (only one can be used at a time) this will queue for you while you take a break or queue for another ride.",5
Two big kids enjoyed the whole Disney experience. The attention to detail in the park and the quality in the rides made for a fab day out.We booked a one day ticket but spent all day there (approx 10 hours) until the park closed after the fireworks finale. We felt a day was enough as the park is quite small in comparison to anything you get in USA and therefore we walked around at least twice and covered all the rides we wanted twice too. The queues for most rides were under 30 mins without paying for a fast pass. Our tip would be to buy any gifts and memorabilia when you arrive as the stores were quiet and you can leave them with guest relations to collect end of the day. The queues at the tills at the end of the day were crazy!,5
"Amazing day in Disneyland. Came with an elder on a wheelchair, and disney staff is always on hand to help and provide a safe passage and special queue for us. Most rides are senior and child friendly.",5
"I love Hong Kong Disneyland because it use english everywhere, unlike Disneyland Japan that some of the rides attractions is using Japanese and you need to use translator thing.",5
Although we spend 2 hours in the queue to take pictures with Mickey and Minnie my 4 year old daughter and 62 year old Mom enjoyed this place equally. Good experience and was the only exciting part of my HK trip,5
What a great experience .. my 3 children stayed there for 12 hours filled with loads and loads of fun!!,5
"We had an amazing day in HK disneyland, the park is much smaller than the one in EU or USA but very convenient. The only downside is the food choices, but other than that you should go go go!",5
"Visiting Hong Kong with an 11 year old meant a trip to Disneyland was always on the cards.Getting to Disneyland is very easy with a dedicated Mickey Mouse inspired spur line off the MTR at Sunny Bay on the Tung Chung line (orange).As soon as you get off the train you know you are in a Disney resort. It's clean and there is a cheerful atmosphere.We spent our day taking in the faster rides now that our daughter is tall enough to ride them. The Star Wars HyperSpace Mountain ride is excellent and wait times are minimised with the freely available fastpass tickets.The RC Racer ride in Toy Story land is a basic pirate ship type of swing ride but styled like a radio control car and if anything a little faster, certainly more thrills than a normal pirate ship ride.The Big grizzly Mountain Runaway mine cars ride was closed during the day but opened later in the evening. This was a boon as we were able to ride this attraction 4 times in a row as the rest of the park had gone to the main street for the parade.Tarzan's treehouse is looking a bit tired and frankly dated... time for rethink there I would suggest. That said the adjacent Jungle River cruise was good fun.The Jedi academy in Tomorrowland was also good fun, 11yo getting to train with other Padewan Learners and ultimately go up against Darth Vader and his apprentice. All in all we had a great day. Only saw one Disney character (Alice) all day but as our 11 yo wasdon't that bothered about photos and signatures neither were we!",5
Have been to almost all disney around the world. Been here twice its much bigger now. Clean restrooms. Much better service. My only complaint is i dont see much disney characters going around. When we were in paris we always see them almost every corner of the huge 2 park. But here u rarely see them. We where saying maybe they are short staff? My daugther was dissapointed coz we did not even see the original disney characters only mickey and minnie and donald the electric parade was awesome! Especially the cars. For me this park is more on rides only not encounter with characters. ,5
Brought kids to the place.  A lot of options to choose from.  We all have a great time.  Space shuttle is a must try!,5
Go to the Tomorrowland and try out the Marvel and Star Wars rides and shows. Get some fast passes and try to go during the weekdays between Monday to Thursday. Friday crowd is huge already.,5
"It   s Disneyland, as if your not going to go! My wife and I love these parks. There is many familiarities to the other Disney parks but plenty of new stuff to look at and do also. Get there early and avoid the fast pass rides(there is only 3 and u can fast pass them later to get a short que) go for the big ticket rides in the toy story land and the grizzly land as those lines get upwards of 50mins throughout the day. Watch the shows especially the lion king one  it was a fantastic show, way better then We expected it to be. Also Stay for the night light parade at 7:30   was a huge highlight. Other then that just enjoy the happiness !",5
This park is very quaint with an amazing background of mountains and ocean. It is super clean and has some great rides that other parks do not have. Get there early as crowds accumulate after lunch so lines can be long. Would definitely go back!,5
Very nice n memorable visit to disneyland the name stands for it definitetly wii go back and bring more family and friends,5
"It was my second visit to Disneyland in a gap of ten years. While all the excitement remains the same, the visiting hours of Mickey,minney,and Pluto have reduced which means of you are not in the queue at the right time, you will miss a photograph with them. However we manage to meet goofy twice and take a family snap which was fun. Some of the rides like flying elephant, tea cup, Winnie the Pooh had their old charm. We used the Disney railroad from main Street USA to fantasy land. We went into the fairy tale garden and took some good photograph. Then, we queued up for the festival f lion show. The show was bright and had a nice story to tell. Towards the evening we came back to main Street USA to watch parade.",5
"Fantastic family day out, immaculately clean, lots to see & do, food outlets excellent with lots of choice, book tickets through Klook.com",5
"Awesome place. Rides for everyone, scary rides, adventure rides, funny rides, experiences etc. Kids love the place for sure. Only thing which i diddon't liked was the cost of food items, ice creams, gift items  souvenirs etc..everything was pretty expensive. After every ride you will end up into a shopping zone where such items were being sold. Avoid taking luggage to the place as they charge a lot to keep the luggage.",5
If you   re in love with Disney then it   s a must go. It   s small but there are the mine gulch and the mansion. Both are very good. Ironman the ride is not worth the wait so if you want to do it take a fast pass.,5
"Slightly expensive but its great for kids below 12 13. Plenty of rides and attractions. Good infrastructure. Go early mornings by 9.30 and leave by 5 or so. Crowd gets more after noon. Cadon't really explain more since Disney is a world famous brand and people already know what to expect. Not much for adults though,",5
"It was my first time ever to Disneyland. I freaking love it!!! . We took MTR not far from our hotel (within walking distance). We had to change train 2x. The last train was Disneyland's train. We arrived there about 10 am ish & stayed up to about 9pm. We were buggered but it was worth it. We took some of the rides, free train ride, Gold mine ride and Star Wars ride. Had lunch and did some shopping. It wasdon't cheap but I thought what the heck, I'm on holiday. It was really worth a visit to Disneyland for a 'young at heart' adults ",5
The park decoration and events are awesome during the holiday season. We enjoyed the Mickey and Friends Christmastime Ball as well as the night parade. Best to purchase via Klook to avoid the queue!  Suggestion:  Please put more restrooms.,5
"Can   t get many ferries with a similar view.  Steeped in history it   s a great, quick and easy way to get around Hong Kong.  Clean and punctual it   s a must do on any visit",5
"Hey all this is my second visit to hongkong Disney land . It remains the same for having a quality time with family . Nothing has changed in last 5 years but they have increased some attractions . Please note don   t take any hand lung gage as it   s not allowed , u have to pay 100 dolllar for keeping it in vaults . There is nothing for pure vegan . It   s expensive to buy tickets there or online . Go to Klook.com and buy tickets on discount . Go n enjoy ...",5
Having been here before on a quite day we visited on Christmas Day whilst on a visit to HongKong. It was crazy with crowds but being Disney it was still worth the visit and as magical as you'd expect from Disneyland.,5
"We went there on 24th Dec, it was fully crowded. Its a must go if you have kids, kids will definitely love, else you may skip if need to. There were two shows which we as a couple with no kids liked the most   lion king and mickey and wondrous book.In Dec they are having Christmas   New year parade, new stage shows in the main lawn area which were really worth witnessing, loved them. Enjoy with your kids!",5
"My wife and I decided to visit Hong Kong for the Christmas, New Year's holidays. Being our first time in Hong Kong we want to see as much as possible. We decided to add a trip to Disneyland as part of our journey. And may I say we diddon't regret it. The park is smaller than most of the Disney parks but that diddon't bother us. As usual the food and drinks are ridiculously priced and in most of the park's food places it's cash only. The day we went the average wait time was about 30 minutes and the weather was perfect. If you visit Hong Kong and you enjoy Disney plan a day trip. You wodon't regret it. One other thing they have there own train line with the MTR it makes getting there a breeze.",5
"Not to mention children... even we adults just love this place! The rides were great for families to play together, the Disney crew will friendly and always give out stickers to children. Thumbs up to all the fantastic working crew in Disneyland! We will definitely come back again! ",5
"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here. I have been fortunate enough to visit the non Asian Disney parks (including the tremendous parks in Orlando) and I was expecting the Hong Kong version to be perhaps a bit underwhelming. Not so. It had all the crowd pleasers and some rather unique experiences not found in the other parks. Both my child and the adults accompanying loved our visits.Deserving special mention would be the Mystic Manor and Runaway mine car rides. Mystic Manor was their take on the Haunted Mansions of the other Disney parks. It had minimal ghostly effects though and was all the better for it. It was an enchanting trackless ride in a choreographed group of four ride vehicles through an atmospheric and enchanting set of rooms (depending on which pair of vehicles you take you get a slightly different ride perspective; my favorite is the front pair). One of the better rides in any Disney park. The runaway mine cars rides is also a very well judged roller coaster ride with three distinct ride segments that will ensure everyone gets something they enjoy. Also enjoyed the Star Wars treatment of the Space Mountain ride.Park staff were friendly, park and toilets clean and food tasty. There are halal options for Muslim guests who should note that the turkey hot dog stand next to the bakery near the entrance is the only such stand in the park that has halal meat. Some restaurants are also halal certified.Really enjoyed my visit and would come again. For first time visitors a two day pass is recommended so that you can experience all the attractions and take your favorite ones twice.",5
The place is truly awesome. Helpful staff and information was easy to find with their help or guidemaps which were given to us. Food may be a challenge for most. Since I was there on Christmas day the place was swarming with people. The best and the most awesome part was the floats and the fireworks. I would definitely visit again.,5
this is the best disney by far because it has no lines.  we were floored that we could get off space mountain and get right back on again with less than a five minute wait.  we are spoiled.,5
"Rides are more catered to young children. Nothing much for adults. However, you should bring your camera because there are amazing shots to be taken. Make sure to stay right till the end as there is a show and there are also fireworks.",5
Had great time here with my family. Everyone enjoyed themselves especially my daughter. Rides was quite good and the staff was helping.,5
"At noon we arrived, traveled by the disney train! Thank God the weather didnt give us any hard time XD. It has been more than 30 years since my last visit to the dream land! Feeing .... kinda weird. We took our near 4 year old girl with us and we went to areas for the little ones! Funny but she had a great time, went on the winni the pooh train ride, Merry go round, and Jimbo the elephant ride! Had lunch and supper there. Food was okay , price is a bit on the high side. Over all, kid had wicked day and bought loads of souvenirs home. Next time will go to Tokyo Disney Land!",5
The best offer you can get is to have a 2 day pass in Disney since you can not explore it in a day and the few hundred of HK$ for the 2nd day. You should buy to a local tours ticket are cheaper than what is posted at Disney ONLINE.,5
"Good experienced and never get bored whenever you visit many times ! All the rides are well managed and staff are kindly assist all the visitors. Toilets also maintained clean and cozy. You can find it everywhere easily. At night some areas a bit tio dark but still okay for senior people to walk slowly. Electrical Parade was fantastic, once it finished, then the staff need to improve how to control too many people in that area go to the right direction.",5
"Disneyland never fails to give me the magical moment! Also loved the rooms at the hotels, big spacious, friendly staffs and clean!",5
"Loved visiting Disneyland with all its Christmas theming it was magical. The lines for the attractions were quite long and you did need to wait up to 50mins in some cases, but the atmosphere made up for it. Food was quick and really good. Will definitely be back again.",5
Such a cheerful place to visit that is easily accessible from downtown Hong Kong via public transit. An enjoyable day trip for sure.,5
"I had a blast. I have never been to any Disneyland so I don   t know what to expect. I guess I was just blown away by the excitement and the child in me so I soaked in everything with big smiles and just be happy about it. The entrance is easy, as we took the shuttle bus from the Disneyland Resort hotel. Walk for 10 mins and reached the gate. I bought tix online and redeemed easily thru the hotel guest gate. So were our meal coupons. The park is huge, and i   m glad that they have this train circling the park. It was almost Christmas and it was Sunday so the pack was there. Average 30 50 mins to wait for a ride, but we went for a Fast Pass for the Iron Man Expo, which was awesome. Had late lunch at Royal Banquet Hall and the steak did not disappoint.Do not miss the parades and the fireworks, it made our day even more spectacular and we went back to hotel extremely tired, but happy! Kudos to the team behind all the shows. I will be back and try other Parks too!",5
We all enjoyed Disney! Even teenagers! Not too grounted. Cean and fresh. Lots of rides. Shopping was made eacy  they   ll take your shoppingat The gate so no need to carry it!,5
"Look, there's just one Disneyland, and comparisons are always odious. Also, to be fully trite, here's another one  When in Rome... So, when in HK, you gotta do the touristy thing and go to Disneyland. It is a great place and the rides are super. Kids love it   they are easy to please, anyway. The lines suck, but they do so everywhere.I had mini heart attacks every time I saw the food snacks prices. I know that's how they earn but everything was just so unnecessarily expensive! Though seeing the happy faces of my sons did assuage that horror somewhat. The adult me cringed at the blatant phoniness but trust me, kids love that kind of in your face stuff. One good thing was the Star Wars display and the parade which kept them mesmerized.",5
"I am impressed with Hkg disneyland in many aspects. The service provided was extraordinary. Their staff is friendly and polite unlike the Japanese in Tokyo Disneyland. Most people wld have expected the service from Japanese to be better but i beg to differ. In tokyo, we were rushed into rides with unfriendly ushers and they were really impatient as they frowned and shouted. In Hkg, my experience was totally different. They were polite and told the visitors nicely where to exit in 3 languages, eng, mandarin and cantonese. Even in states, the service was on par. Tokyo Disneyland is a letdown when we visited last yr. i will say not to waste extra money gg to Tokyo and settle with Hkg Disneyland! ",5
"This is a smaller version of the LA Disneyland but still just as fun.We thoroughly recommend going during the HK winter, as there are no crowds and its nice and cold. Buy the tickets on line and go mid week. We suggest taking your own picnic, as most of the cafes are closed as its off season. There were only two restaurants open, but as it was easy to get a table and the food was OK.There were no queues and we were able to get on all rides and attractions with minimal queueing. The MTR is an easy and efficient way to get there, with the train taking you right to the door.",5
I diddon't expect much   I have been in Asterix park with the kids etc. But it was good time with family. One day is enought. Food is also superb in the park. All atractions   excellent. Tikcet price is reasonable. Easy to find from city.,5
"Is overpriced for what it is. was not up to my expectation of the USA experience, so came away feeling quite disappointed cues were very long and the staff not so able to hand western English speaking visitors.",5
"Disney flair plus Asian courtesy    a great combination. It's not too big    actually very comfortable to negotiate on foot. The lines were not long. The attractions totally up to date with the newest characters as well as the old standbys. The parades exciting. The food everywhere. Something wonderful for all ages: children, teenagers, adults! You will not want to leave.",5
Try to go on a weekday. Supposed to be much less crowded. Booked our tickets through klook. Try to research before about events and parades.,5
I went there when I was five years old which was five years ago! Now I   m ten.I would say that there was a lot of changes and it has improved.The rides are all very awesome but they   re also very short. Considering all the wait in the long queue at the end of the day you think to yourself it wasn   t worth it. But if you think about it you   re not in Disneyland everyday!,5
"Best experience ever   the hotel itself, if you're staying is also amazing. Highly recommend it to anyone who is a disney character lover.",5
Hong Kong Disneyland was one of the most memorable trip in my entire life. It brought lots of joys and took back me to my childhood days.  A fun loving and must visit for eveyone.,5
"I went with my mom and lil sister. It was summer so it was super hot, i learned it the hard way that u HAVE to bring used sunblock beforehand coz I got sunburned badly I went on friday and there were not many people inside the park! I rode most of the big rides (7 rides including big grizzly bear my favs, mystic manor, its a small world, hyperspace mountain, and other small attractions) The wait time is between 0 10 minutes MAX! Which is super awesome coz we dont have to que and stand in line for so long. The food tho quite disappointing, I ate at banquet hall(if im not wrong its the castle foodplace) and ordered fish and fries, my sis got hamburger and fries, and my mom ordered some noodles. The foods were bland :( The cafes pastries and bread are really good, i ordered this flaky chashiu pastry and ice milktea it was really tasty!The staffs and cast are lovely, helpful and nice, toilets are clean and big, they also have water fountain for u to drink free if u dont mind drinking from tap water.Unfortunately I did not stay for fireworks :    but for my first disney park experience I enjoyed it so much!!One tip for you all the merchandise are ofc overprice(its disney what do u expect) I recommend u to not buy the    foods    items inside the giftshops such as candies, ramen, lollypop, etc, why? Cause they are soooo overprice and you can get ur own disney themed candies foods outside disneyland!!! For example i bought this gummy candy from the park and it cost 65 HKD the. I went to best mart 360 guess what I found same exact candy for 12 HKD!!!! And guess what they have other candies with better taste and packaging with DISNEY LICENCED as well!!! So dont waste ur money for candies foods inside the park giftshops, visit bestmart 360 after, your welcome!!",5
It was a lot of fun for my family with young children. Not to big of a park to get overwhelmed. Staff was friendly and courteous.,5
"Fantastic place if you have kids under 9 10. Cosy, small, in some days mid week is not crowded. Worth to have a yearly pass or book via Klook.",5
Bought tickets online to save time when entering park. Spent the full day at park and closed off with night display of fireworks. The queues were a bit long but fast tracked queues from vouchers received at Disney hotel. Personal family favorites were the iron...More,5
Disneyland still has its charm. Great for families with young kids. Best to go on a weekday to avoid long queues. Download the official app for more efficient time management. Tickets can also be purchased online beforehand from travel agents (go google) at discounted prices.,5
"disneyland is such a magical place. it makes me happy. i have been to both disneyland in los angelos and orlando. the hk disneyland is a bit on the small side, but the fun is the same! love it when you go with family and friends.",5
We stayed at Disney Hotel which is 10 min walk from this place. Ended up buying 2 days ticket so we can take our leisurely time to explore the place. The hotel gave us 2 Premier Passes which allow you to skip the queue in 2 of the 5 selected rides. Very useful indeed.Another tip is to make use of the FastPass facility so that you dodon't spend too much of your time standing in the queue.Download the Disney app which provides real time information on the queueing time in each ride.,5
This place is not just for kids it   s for all age groups.. apart of way it is made it   s remarkable how it   s been maintained and staff is super trained and courteous. You need 2 day to cover entire park as there is lot of waiting for each rides. Food options are good but over priced. My favourite moment was to meet IRON MAN ,5
The theme park superb story galleries even much better but the rides ok types. To much Q n the rides are timed very short u wait for so long and before u realise the ride is over. The toys inside are quite expensive but they...More,5
"Definitely a must visit place in Hong Kong. To be able to do all the activities and visit everything, a full day is recommended",5
Compare to tokyo disneyland was smaller but worth a try out. When there around 1130am as the park u can enjoy there for a whole day. Firework started at 830pm u must see it. A little advice... purchase ticket from klook add in meal voucher as the food there was really expensive. ,5
"well , its disneyland, what more can you sayits worth the entrance fee, if your budget allows it, go here.the iron man ride is really good and funthe only negative thing i can say about the park is about the food, the STARLINER DINER serves really bad chicken. cardboard actually has more flavor than their chicken. its cheapest resto available on the park, but the food is REALLY bad, just go for the fries and drinks",5
"I have been before about 10 years ago. This is a great park plenty to do and not too big. As not a fan of rollercosters it was fine for me and my boyfriend who is a rollercoster fan.We got the ticket that you pay extra for a meal, we got burger and chips and a drink this was great value, ticket also included a snack   best popcorn I've tasted. They have a Pandora store which I bought a limited edition disney charm. Qued the most was 20mins and its disney magic. The Lion king show was fab, the night parade was magical and the disney fireworks were great. Also great transport got the disney train that is designed with disney windows etc. What a great fun day!",5
We start our trip here from 1 pm but we still done all attraction.   Not so big as Tokyo but its also good to soend your time here.  Food and drink are expensive here as ususal,5
"If you   ve never been to a Disneyland this is a good introduction to what Disney has to offer. If you   ve been to Disney in any other country, consider this a miniature, manageable one day version of it. The attention to details are to be admired. A lot of rides and attractions are localised, especially the Ironman Experience (which replaced the Buzz Lightyear ride). Most narration is in English, Cantonese and Putonghua, with some being in Cantonese only (Animation Academy). The Mickey Wonderous Book Show was all in Cantonese except the singing parts. However there are subtitles and it doesn   t really take away from understanding of the the graphics show. The restaurants are nothing special. The quality of food is below par and are overpriced. When we went three of the main restaurants were closed so food choice was limited. Luckily we were staying in the hotel so we had that option instead. I didn   t see any drinking water stations. We went on Saturday and Sunday. We ended up not needing the fast pass. Lines were 30 mins max. The lines which were 50mins plus we skipped until later in the evening. If you get to the park as soon as it opens, you can fit in most of the rides before noon. Late afternoon was when it got crazy busy. The evening parade was spectacular. Very impressive. The fireworks were impressive as they are much lower than most firework displays so it was extremely bright. The accompanying music was what made it extra special. And the fake snow comes on right after which was fun. ",5
"Visited Disneyland for a couple of days and the Christmas decoration and programs were very nice. The crowd wasdon't too bad and we could easily find seats during dining. The disappointing things were that the character queues were exceptionally short, partly due to the Christmas program, and there were just so few photographers. You can walk the main street up to the Christmas trees all day without a single Photographer.",5
Best place to visit to bring your childhood memories back to life with your kids you can enjoy almost the rides you can the stories which you heard for years from your parents and teachers absolute must visit place awesome is one word can be used for this place.,5
"Hong Kong Disneyland gives you the full Disney experience. We both the 2 day flexi pass and went in on the Thursday and Monday. Both days were relatively uncrowded, unlike the weekends. Most rides only had about a 10 minute wait. We watched the Lion King show which was excellent, then the parades. The night time parade (Light the Night) has characters from Monsters Inc, Lilo & Stitch and Cars as well as Mickey, Donald, etc. I recommend getting the Photo pass as the photographers take plenty of photos and also do the  magic shots  with characters added to your photos. There are plenty of food places for lunch and dinner. Stay for the fireworks at 8.30pm. The Disney train station for the MTR is right at the front gate and you can get free shuttle buses to the Disney hotels. We will definitely be going back!!",5
"One of out top reasons in going to HK. It certainly brings the child in you. Dodon't expect the rides to be that extreme though. But the shows, parks, everything inside HK Disneyland is so magical. Stay for another half an hour to take pictures when crowd goes lesser. Tip: Book a pass and meal voucher via klook and redeem them at the gates. It's way cheaper and hassle free. ",5
"My husband and I visited HK Disneyland today and were very impressed with the park. Having visited WDW Orlando and Disneyland Anaheim our expectations were pretty high and you exceeded those expectations. The entry process was quick and easy and the staff were very friendly. Download the app before you go so you can study the map and attractions etc. this also gives you the wait times for the attractions and you can also purchase your tickets from here. The lines for the rides were minimal and the most we had to wait was 20 minutes at one stage of the day. A few of the rides and attractions we had seen before and thought it wouldn   t hurt to skip them, but having to wait less in queues meant that we could enjoy all the attractions. I   m glad we had time for this as almost every ride at HK Disneyland is different than the other parks in the USA.    Disney paint the night    was absolutely fantastic, a great addition to the nighttime entertainment. Food was a little over priced as always with any theme park but we found plenty on offer. If you   re heading to Hong Kong and have never experienced a Disney Park, then I would recommend HK Disneyland as a place to start. I would rate this park Second to Disneyland Anaheim.",5
Great Disney experience. I would recommend two days as the park is big but easy to get around. Great Disney facilities that you would expect with 3 live show offerings. Good prices weredon't too bad. I found that the lines for the characters were extremely long so line up early if this is something you really want.,5
"I'm truly a big fan of Disneyland parks. This one rather small compared to the U.S. But just nice. We diddon't get to complete all the rides the queue was long probably it was the weekend and also during the winter holidays. But we got most of the stuff we wanted to see n do. Would try to come back maybe when kids are a bit older, with a baby and 2 kids was quite challenging at times. But we all had a wonderful time cadon't wait to be back here again. Loved the ending part as we were leaving they simulated snow          falling on main Street. That was really awesome... Winter wonderland. ",5
"I had read so many negative reviews saying Hong Kong Disneyland is a half day park. This was definitely not the case for me. If you are a Disney fanatic you will not be disappointed. We spent 3 full days there and it was so magical. You need a day for shopping alone, the merchandise is so amazing!",5
"It was great visiting this place. It was full of fun. Rides, shows, and especially road show was amazing. We will visit again. Love you disneyland.",5
"I got a chance to visit Hong Kong Disneyland during my trip to Hong Kong, this July. It was like a childhood dream come true. It is indeed the happiest place on earth. Do not miss on meeting the characters and Mystic Manor attraction is my personal favorite. The fireworks in the evening are really magical. FYI, July marks the beginning of typhoon season in Hong Kong, although there is nothing to worry about but make sure you plan your trip well and enjoy at least a day or two in Hong Kong Disneyland. It is all worth it.",5
"This is our 2nd time @ hongkong disneyland we really enjoyed every moment we stay there all are tourist attraction , rides and the parade , show and especially the lights parade and the fireworks at night is so amazing super thumbs up !!! My family did enjoy we will come back again, the food is great i love the chicken and the fish fillet with fries hmmm great we will recommend disneyland to mya friends ",5
"The shows (both street shows & theater shows) are a must see. It forms the basis of the magic of Disney! Food is very expensive at the Disney theme park. 3 sets of lunch combos with drinks cost $72 SGD. Rides were short but exciting without being too intimidating. You will need a two day pass to explore everything. Iron man, Thrill Mountain rides are exciting. ",5
"Disneyland is awesome and must go if you are in Hong Kong! Had a totally fun filled day even though there were no kids with us! You will miss your childhood after being here. Very well maintained, there are long queues but not too much waiting time as the place is very well organized. ",5
Must visit Disneyland when in Hong Kong. Its marvelous and not only kids but people of all ages just love it. All attractions are well created. The parade and the fireworks at the end of the day are awesome.,5
"All I could really say is  WOW ! I was so amazed when we visited the place it made me feel like a young kid again. This is the best place and if I could go back I'll spend a week in that place, just walking around and seeing the rides the place is too awesome and I cadon't even find the exact word to describe it.",5
"This is one of the best thing to do in hong kong. Also try to get 2 day pass as it is hardly expensive and you got time to do all activity. Make sure you reaches DL by 9.30 AM to see the opening ceremony. The moment you are in, try to get into the que for taking picture with Mickey Mouse as the crowd enter this it will get more crowded and then kindly headed to Iron Man Make sure you watch disney parade at 3 PM and also the fire work show at 7 Pm",5
"This a cool place to spend time with all the characters and might need 2 days to cover it all. Plan your itinerary well, and decide what needs to be covered in advance. The parade and Disney story show are not to be missed. Be mindful of Long queues for taking photo with the characters, especially Mickey and Minnie.Just want to mention about a staff named    Ronald   . We was very professional and friendly with all the visitors. ",5
Smaller version of Disney world. Disney land made my 2 year old  and me happy. This is the happiest place in the world. The showed were still awesome. Love Disney world and land. It   s a lot cheaper than Disney world in Orlando.,5
"Though smaller than the rest of the Disneyland franchises, this is still a fun place to be at.For Muslims, they cater with Halal places at 2 locations:1) Tahitian Terrace (Adventureland)2) Explorer's Club Restaurant (Mystic Point)Cool rides:Grizzly Bear   runaway mine carsRC RacerIronman 4DHyperspace MountainMystic ManorNot to miss is the firework show as well as the lion king show.There are only 3 rides that have FastpassThere's too much good stuff to talk about   best is to do the research on Disneyland Hong Kong and plan for your trip.",5
Excitement theme park. all Disney characters and movie in here. wonderful landscaping. suit all ageds,5
"First experience here, would advise taking the 1 day pass along with food, works out cheaper and you can visit all the attractions and rides in a day",5
"Such a great place to spend day as a happy kid again! No matter of the age you are on! :) everyone will find something funny for themselves, beside the typical Minnie and Mickey experience you will enjoy the 5D ride with Iron Man on the marvel experience corner. I loved the adventure trolley rollecestor and the slide rollecestor in ToyStory Land Enjoy! Ps: avoid weekends!!!",5
"we enjoyed every minute at this theme park. it drizzled during the fireworks display but we opted to stay because it   s just spectacular! it was one magical night for for our children and of course for us, their parents. we stayed at their hotel for 2 days so we experienced the parades at night and during the day. ",5
"You're Muslim and first time visiting Hong Kong? Afraid not. You will be surprised to know that Hong Kong Disneyland actually have two halal outlets namely The Explorer Club and the other The Tahiti Terrace. As a Muslim, I'm very impressed that they also have prayer room complete with the ablutions room. You just need to bring your own praying mat and there you go!",5
"This is my 2nd time here. First time with Husband, current 2nd time with my 2 year old toddler. A small Disneyland with lesser rides compared to the other theme parks. But the program for the kids are packed plenty, such as the shows and parades. With a toddler, these are more than enough to be kept occupied the entire day, together with the rides.Having gone to the other theme parks, Disneyland really is one of the few that can create a magical experience for the kids. Strongly recommended for kids and family. If you   re going as a couple, it   ll still be fun, but you   ll run out of rides pretty quickly.",5
"Took the family for the whole day to the attraction. We found everything about the park absolutely fantastic. We could get around an see everything and we also got to go on most of the rides. The parades were amazing.My only complaint was the price of food and they had several restaurants closed down for refurbishment which put pressure on the others. However, we took in some of our own food and water and when security checked our bags they did not seem to mind.They crew were efficient at moving people through the attractions.",5
"What an incredible day we had! We had such a magical time from the MTR Disneyland line that took us to Disneyland, to the fireworks at the end of the night. We went on 90% of the rides and got to check out the parades throughout the day. The only thing we missed out on was Mickey Mouse stories as this got filled half an hour before it was going to start and was full throughout the evening.Also it   s not clear what location you can meet Donald Duck  mickey  Minnie We finally found mickey and Minnie and there was a huge queue to meet them. We excitedly got into the queue and were turned away at 3pm which was very disheartening for me personally. Maybe something that can be improved on with clear locations and timings as none were provided on the day. All in all it was a wonderful day 5 5",5
"Our family (3 Adult) with our 4 year old went for two wonderful days (US$303 4pax 2day). It was less expensive for us than Ocean Park due to the huge promo. The park was empty except after 4pm which made it difficult to see the evening Halloween Parade. Disney has free water & free seating all over the park for a great comfortable day. The very long Disney rides have moving seats so you can rest while enjoying the adventure. They also have great sit down shows where you also rest. At other amusement parks you stand all day for rides seconds long. There are so many wonderful adventures here at this park. It is great for parents because you are not forced to go on bone crushing rides, because they have imagination rides instead. The Lion King Show was the best, my 4 year old loved the Iron Man simulator though it was a little rough for my wife & It's Small World is a family Fun Boat Ride. The Jedi training for only very small children was a great treat for me & my wife. They hired really quality actors to play in this realistic training of a Jedi Knight. The kids believe they are doing it. The mine ride roller coaster is great without knocking your teeth out. The Mystic Manner was my favorite ride of a spooky house of a rich antique collector, though my son was hiding under the ride chair. You take 100's of photos everywhere you turn. This park is so beautiful and so clean (except the dinning area). Donald Duck 4D movie (spitting water) was good after second view, my son could not pick up the concept the first time around. Meeting Mickey Mouse on Main Street (@930am before the gates open at 10am) in all his royalty was a highlight. The early parade is better because the crowds have not arrived yet.The night time fire works show is one of the best in the world. The Chinese government had the biggest fireworks show in maybe the world the day before we went to Disneyland, so Disney kind of switched there show to a multi media fireworks lights sound themed show which made it very unique.Even with the empty park, there were no empty tables to eat food at in there dining rooms (this is something they need to fix).You will have a very long day at Disney because no one leave until after the wonderful night time fireworks show. There is a 730pm night parade than 9pm fireworks. Then it is a rush to the over crowded train.DOdon't MISS: Meeting Mickey Lion King Day Parade Iron Man Simulator Tiny Kids Jedi Training Mystic Manner Mickey 4D Movie Fireworks Mine Ride Roller Coaster Its A Small World boat ride maybe Jungle River",5
"Brought our 5 year old son there and it was his first Disneyland experience. Easily accessible by mtr and all the facilities are well maintained. Expect to queue for 40 minutes and onwards for the rides unless with fast pass. Generous food potions at the in house restaurants. We stayed till the Night Parade and fireworks, a truly enjoyable experience for the whole family! ",5
The place is really good and child friendly. Attractions are beautiful specially the parade and fireworks at night. Be ready for long walks and bring water. Food inside the park is expensive. Come early if you want to have decent photo at the entrance. A must visit when in HK. ,5
Found it a lot easier than first thought ..... caught taxi first couple of days ... wish we hadn   t bothered,5
"Having two kids aged 7 and 4, HK Disneyland had to be on the agenda. To avoid (or at least minimize) your waiting time in the lines, try to visit during a weekday.",5
"Disneyland is place that you can only enjoy if you like Disney properties like Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, etc and also Marvel Characters and Star Wars.The whole park is divided into multiple parts like Tomorrowland, Toy Story Land, Fantasyland, etc. All the parts cater to attractions matching the theme. There is also a train which runs all around the perimeter connecting all the parts of the park to the entrance. There are many gift shops and restaurants, including an Indian Restaurant. Prices are high.All in all a great place to spend the day. Closing ceremony has a night parade and fireworks show.Beware of the lines at all the attractions rides, they are long and take up most of your time at the park.",5
"So we went to Disney land and our age ranged from 23 50. It was great day out!We caught the Disney express out which a cool themed train totally didn   t expect it.We bought our tickets online prior to going, so simple. The rides are friendly and not tooo freaky! The only one that got me was the Star Wars one but that   s because I   m a scaredy cat! However it was still freaking exciting!The light spectacular parade was awesome!I recommend downloading the app prior to attending as you can see the cue times!It   s clean, perfect, everyone is happy and friendly! I have not done any other Disneyland   s else where but I still enjoyed it for what it is worth. ",5
"This was our first experience of Disney. As seniors we could get in for $100 HK   a real bargain, and a chance we coulddon't turn down. We got there early on a Friday as advised and when we walked into Main Street we were one of the first. We walked around the site bemused. The jungle river ride suited our age group but then we found the mire exciting rides. We zoomed up and down roller coasters, we flew up and down on dumbos, we tried most things, ogled at the characters on parade and finally sat down to an expensive cuppa with a Micky Mouse biscuit thrown in!It was great! It you have the time fellow seniors, do it!One point, they dodon't like you taking food in but our cheese sandwiches were allowed and our bottle of water.It gets hot, take a fan, Sun umbrella and cream up.It gets very busy later in the day so go early.The biggest queue was for Its a Small World, we hardly queued for anything else.We diddon't stay for the fireworks   perhaps we've seen too many fireworks already? Perhaps we ran out of energy!",5
THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH. The park is manageable not so big and has everything for kids and adults. Seeing my daughter so happy just seeing the Disney princesses was more than enough to make it worth our while. Food was also surprisingly good at the Great Banquet Hall where we ate. ,5
The happiest place on earth and the best place to relax and reminice our childhood days! Forever i will always be a fun of mickey and minnie together with their friends in disney.this is the perfect place for family and friends. Over all rating is 5,5
"The best thing we did in Hong Kong. Stayed the whole day, and enjoyed the park very much. There was never a dull moment. We went there on the 1st day of November. It was a good day, quiet, and with no long queue. The size of the park makes it manageable, not just for young children but for older people. best to being camera, umbrella or hat to cover in outdoor exploring activities, and wearing a very comfortable walking shoes is a must. Its good also that we already purchased our ticket (entrance and meals) online to avoid the hassle and queuing lines. It was an experience for my older companions, seeing how delightful they are and how they feel young again. Disneyland never fails to unleash the child in us again. Our favorite ride, as always is  It's a Small World! ",5
Couldnt get better.   The day after tropical cyclone made the climate a bit bad..else it was a memorable trip.,5
It was my very first time at a Disney park and I must say HK Disneyland was great for that. It's not too big and overwhelming   I could do almost everything in a day without having to wait too long ( maybe because I was alone) but either way it is a comfortable park and very clean. It was super fun and the prices are absolutely ok. Would really recommend it :) ,5
"Hong Kong Disney is small but fabulous. HK residents get two visits for the price of one, what more could you want? The Disney MTR adds charm and gets you in the spirit even before arriving. It   s a perfect day trip with enough to keep you occupied all day without you leaving feeling like you   ve missed some. Highly recommend!! ",5
"My birthday trip and was my first trip to Disneyland and it diddon't disappoint me! It's truly fun filled and magical! The light parade is totally awesome! Everyone was singing, dancing and waving with the characters! The energy and spirits of everyone is high! And who doesdon't love the fireworks display!The rides are amazing and it caters for all.Kudos to be given to all staffs in Disneyland Hong Kong! I cannot imagine how the staffs handled the teeming excited crowds of people everyday. And as we stayed till the closing hour, we noticed how efficient the cleaners cleaned the areas, the bins and restrooms! It had been thoroughly cleaned and freshen up when we used the restroom before taking the MTR back to our hotel. ",5
"A fantastic journey for families with small kids. We did a two day tour and that was great. Lots of attractions, somewhat crowded but bearable. You can find attractions for all age groups. Food is not good  to me that was the biggest dissappointment but overall I LOVED IT       ",5
"everyone would love going to Disneyland. Their theme park.is so fascinating, always crowded all the time. The souvenirs are so cute and adorable. Spend some memorable time with ur family here and let their staff take your family picture and you can have a nice family portrait printed in the Winnie the pooh frame. The softcopy file will also given to you by their apps. Tips:  buy their tickets online include meal. They have a package of 4. it's cheaper buying online than buying on the spot. And you'll save a lot of time to avoid the queue  Wear hat and sunglasses, use comfy shoes. Cause you will walk a lot  Try their fastpass tickets",5
"Out of all the Disneyland I had been to, I actually appreciated this for its small size. Coming from Southeast Asia, I also take pride seeing local talent given the chance to shine.We went a week before Easter and all the Springtime Festival d  cors were up.We took the chance to use the FastPass as best as possible especially in Fantasyland which catered to the youngest crowd.Food was reasonable and were of better quality than what I remembered from Disneyland Paris! Maxim   s has a restaurant here for a good grub before heading home.The Mickey Mouse waffles on Main Street was great.The meet and greet were very popular but maddening as the queues snaked out of view.Electric parade was not too impressive.Fireworks and light and sound show was lovely.Shops were nicely laid out and not too overwhelming, thankfully.",5
"Amazing!!!!  Dream come true, it was so beautiful. The street show was so magical, food was delicious n reasonable price.",5
"While the size of HK Disneyland isn   t big, but it is enough for families with young children. There are sufficient rides and shows to keep everyone entertained for the whole day. You need more than 1 day to cover every attraction in the park. Buy the meal combo ticket, it is better value. ",5
A really nice little Disney land. Had a great time visiting. Something for everyone there. Awesome Fireworks display afterwards.,5
There will be not enough time to spend a day in Disneyland. It was fantastic experiences. The food queuing was long time. I think would add some food variety. It would be good if you put some of vending machine for some snacks. I was impressed by staff who cleaning in the restaurant area they are so nice and polite. Keep it good work!,5
"Thanks to HK's efficient MTR system, this place is very easy to reach. Go there at least 45 minutes before opening because by opening time, there's already a huge build up of people waiting for the  flood gates  to open. And when they do, people run toward the most popular rides to try to beat each other out of the line. Our first ride was the Iron Man Experience   careful, lots of motion in this 3D theater but fun. If you can, plan for a two day visit to make the most of the park especially if you have kids in tow. My favorite experience was  The Lion King Show . Dodon't miss this for anything else there. Also, if you can purchase food vouchers inclusive of your tickets, do so. I did two meals and a snack   for each of my family members and I'm glad I did because we planned and did stay there from start to finish. This was a better way to save money than having to purchase individual meals there.That said, for next time, we would just buy one meal (preferably dinner that is redeemable after 4:30 PM) and a snack (a choice of popcorn or ice cream stick anytime) for each person and just eat a heavy breakfast before leaving home or hotel. My favorite meal was the  Singapore Laksa Noodle Soup  at the Tahitian Terrace (you can redeem vouchers at other restaurants as well). The Indian Tandoori Chicken meal was  blah .As for the fireworks display, try to position yourself somewhere in the Rotunda of the Main Street to have the best view of the fireworks when they conclude the day. If you have kids (or you're a kid at heart) ask the attendants for stickers, even the janitors themselves happily give them out for collecting. And, bring a water bottle. Drinking fountains are a bit scarce there (there's one by the Iron Man Experience) out that's the way to stay hydrated and saving money at the same time. If you're used to Disneyland in California and Florida, dodon't expect the cast to be as friendly. They are, just not U.S. Disney friendly. At least that's my personal opinion. Enjoy!",5
"This Disneyland would have to be one of the best Disneyland's I have ever been to.It totally blew me away at how fantastic it was. I was here when it opened 12 years on a education trip as I'm a travel agent. I thought it was good then but very small and limited thrilling rides.Wow it has changed !!Toy story land is fantastic, All the rides were so cool!The new Iron man experience was awesome and getting to meet the REAL iron man ( so said my 5 year old) was totally cool !Mystic Manor was so different and exciting!All cast members we came across we're super friendly and all had different Disney stickers to hand out to everyone which was so nice.The Lion King show and Mickey's Wondorous book were basically 30 minute broadway shows ! It was incredible! The singing, the dancing was 6 stars !The 3pm parade and the paint the night parade at 630pm were awesome! The energy from all the performers was infectious! They looked you in the eye as they past, they waved and high fived my kids, tinker bell blew kisses to my son and made him feel so special as did the Dances in the jumping Tigger costumes. They were so talented.The park was spotless as were every toilet I went to and every eating area. Even the lady taking our order at the Comet diner was so friendly and talking to my kids and I in English. Food was good to!Every part of my 3 days here was amazing. One of our best family holidays said my 8 year daughter.We also stayed at the explorers lodge at Disneyland which was also fantastic.",5
Yes it's smaller than the other disney parks but queueing times are the shortest. Went on a weekday and the longest queue was 10 minutes. Only complaint is that it opens late and closes early. Some restaurant dodon't accept new customers by 7pm.,5
"Originally we were unsure about taking our toddler to Disneyland, but after reading a few blogs advice we decided to give it a go. We had a great day!  The park is a lot smaller than the original Disney in California, which I saw as an advantage. It's flat so easy with a stroller (although we only took our carrier). We caught the train, which takes you straight to the entrance. I was surprised by the number of rides we were able to take our toddler on, Fantasyland was a particularly good for this. I'll list them below:FantastylandDumbo the Flying Elephant   simple up and down ride that she loved. We had to ride separately (only 2 per carriage).It's a Small World   a little nervous about the dark initially, but loved the music and charactersCinderella's Carousel   horses are quite high up making it difficult to stand next to the toddler if you sit them on a horse. We had a carrier which made it easier, I just hopped on and she was happy to hold the pole.Mad hatter's Tea Cups   closed for maintenance :( but easy to ride with a toddlerThe Adventures of Winnie the Pooh   got a bit scary in parts (darkness thunder lightening)Fairy Tale Forest   Loved wandering around this, she happily bopped away to the music. Mickey's Philharmagic   she sat on my knee and bopped away. Did get a little loud and dark at timesTomorrowland Orbitron   very simular to Dumbo ride but in spaceshipsNothing else was suitable for toddlers ToyStory Playland Slinky Dog Zig Zag Spin   Simular to Dumbo and Orbitron but a bit fasterAdventureland We diddon't make it here but the Jungle Cruise and Tarzan's Treehouse could be doable with a toddler. Theatre in the Wild   Loved the Lion King Show!!! Highly recommended!We diddon't stay for the parade as our toddler was so tired. There are 2 parades   3pm and 6.30pm. Fireworks at 7.30. The food was ok, but i recommend bring snacks for the toddler (you're not supposed to bring food into the park, but as long as you're not packing a picnic they seem to overlook it).We went on a Tuesday and got there as soon as it opened (10.30am) so the park wasdon't crowded and the lines for the rides were 5 10 minutes maximum. Discount park tickets and food vouchers are available through Klook and simple to redeem. We just went straight to the turnstile when we arrived. Highly recommend a trip to Hong Kong Disneyland if you have a toddler and a day free when in HK.",5
Transport out there was great.I used the MTR very clear signage .Whole day was wonderful.Brought back lots of memories of Sunday nights watching Disneyland.Lion King show was great.Highly recommend.,5
Since our kids are small this park was much easier to handle than Disney World. We went during the week and there were less people so it was manageable. Would recommend buying the food package since it costs less then if you bought the food regularly. ,5
"This Disneyland is small, but it's beautiful. The landscaping is wonderful. We enjoyed walking around the park. Since we're seniors, we got into the park for the equivalent of $13 USD. Amazing!Mystic Manor, their version of the Haunted Mansion, was fabulous. The Jungle Cruise offers three language options. Although we chose English, we could only catch a word or two of what the guide said. Still, the ride is an upgrade from the CA Jungle Cruise.  ",5
"Disneyland any where is great, this is not as big as Anaheim but is still a great day out. You can ride on most rides even without a special front of the line pass.",5
"We loved our recent trip to Disneyland; it was our main reason for coming to Hong King. The park is perfect for little ones, with only two rides with height restrictions. It was quiet when we were there, and we didn   t wait more than 10 minutes for Any ride. It took us 2 days to see everything, but we didn   t stay for the full day on either one as the kids were very tired by about 3pm. The parade was fantastic, and they were so excited to meet a few princesses. The MTR (trains) make it so easy to get here, and for minimal cost, from anywhere in Hong Kong. ",5
"Fantastic experience @ Disney land Hong Kong,China. The ambiance was electrifying and took us back to child hood on a  time machine .",5
"We were allotted just a day for Disneyland, located on Lantau Island, in our package tour, and I knew it would not be enough from experience. ( I had been to Disneyworld in Florida and in three full consecutive days I had not been able to see all of it. ) We were awestruck by the beauty, the colourful displays and the cleanliness when we entered the Magical Fantasy Land ! We tried to work out a schedule according to the times and places where shows would be held, as detailed in the free brochure, but soon had to give it up since running from one location to another to keep up with the timings in the vast place was well nigh impossible. Trying another more practical approach, we started exploring with the help of a guide map also provided free. Still, in each attraction we could see only one or two parts before moving on, lest we miss out on many more.Being Sunday, there was a special parade from 3 to 4 and again from 7 to 8 p.m. We could enjoy a boat ride through a  jungle  with mechanised, very realistic animals, had lunch at The Explorer's Club ( there were country   region wise food areas,which sold mostly fast food and also some ethnic dishes ), saw many fairy characters and read a few pages of stories from books displayed on pedestals. We could visit or see stalls of Spider Man, Iron Man and Merman, had a tram ride and also saw The Toy Story. In the evening we enjoyed a song and dance programme in the auditorium before returning to Main Street to watch the display of fireworks at the end of the day. The entrance ticket included all rides and attractions and we did not have to pay anything more except for food and drink and souvenirs of which there was a plethora to choose from at various sales points. Some staff members gave away stickers with pictures of characters and attractions..We boarded our coach to return to the hotel, thrilled, tired, but yearning for more. SPECIAL MENTION : It had become very hot during the day. One of our group members was on a wheel chair and one of the rubber tyres became loose due to the heat. We tried to fix it back, but in vain. We were so grateful to a strong well built Philipino gentleman who helped us get back on track.At the auditorium, the differently abled person was given priority and accommodated in a vantage position along with her escort.RECOMMENDATIONS : 1. Plan for at least two full days to spend at Disneyland to be able to enjoy yourselves at leisure   more if you have young children, who would enjoy rides of which there are many. You have to queue up in many places for which some time should be allowed.2. Carry your own drinking water   it is exorbitantly priced inside !",5
"Wow, their roller coaster in adventure land is as smooth as the dwarf ride at WDW Magic Kingdom and only a 10 minute wait without a fast pass! Pretty impressed with their Space Mountain that has a star wars theme too! The least waiting I have ever done at Disney and all are top notch fun. It's a small world has Disney movie characters in it here, but I diddon't remember that in Florida. Amazing weather too and does not seem as expensive as Florida.Getting there using the MTR subway was easy and cheap for a day trip.",5
"If like me you have waited 36 years to go to a Disneyland World then this place is awesome. It's relatively easy and painless to get to   it has its own MTR line with Disney themed train and i would recommend purchasing tickets online prior. Also if you can, visiting on a Monday or Tuesday is recommended and get there early. We went on a Tuesday, set out at around 10 and got there around 11.30 and the crowds were manageable, we had space to take it in and get decent pictures. The queue for rides was 10 20 mins and at the height of the day, around 2.00 we waited around an hour. As you would imagine there is plenty to see, eat and drink around the park with a large multi cuisine restaurant just after Toy Story Land. Building our own lightsabers was the highlight of the day!An absolutely brilliant day for big and little kids.",5
"Very nice place and awesome. people who go to hongkong must try to go to disneyland. disney really good for people who want to ge some fun, with family, friend or for couple.the price a bit expensive but u will not regret when u are already there. trust me :)btw u can go to disney using mrt.",5
"If you've been to any of the American Disney's you will be disappointed by this one as it is a redacted version, favouring those rides areas suitable for younger children. However, it is still a lot of fun, very well maintained, and with all the characters you would expect. Well laid out and easy to get around. Easy to get to also, being a 30 minute train ride from Central. If you've never been to any of the other Disney's then definitely go here!",5
"Disneyland is a must go in HK!! The halloween parade and additional booths were really a nice touch. The decoration and furnishing of the whole place was amazing and fantasy like. Most rides at disneyland were very subtle and suitable for children. Overall, its a must visit and you can take alot of nice pictures there! Also, do not miss the fireworks at night near the sleeping beauty castle it was the best part so beautiful!!",5
"A chance to let your hair down and just be a kid. Yes chase down Minnie Mouse to have your photo taken with her, hug a Minion, get in and have fun. Did the rides, ate there and stayed for the night parade and fireworks. Well worth it. Arranged for a tour to collect us from hotel. This way diddon't have to worry about trains and buses and lining up for tickets. and the best thing was that the bus was waiting at the entrance to take you straight back to hotel   especially after a long day at the park. Take a plastic poncho with you as some of the rides you will get wet. And yes   buy the Mickey Mouse t shirt too!!!!",5
"My husband and I scheduled a trip to HK with no prior plans set. When he suggested going to Disney I was so excited! I have never been to Disney so this was a chance to check that off my bucket list. We preordered tickets through an app for a small discount. This allowed us to go in without queue (which seemed short anyway). It was the weekend prior to Halloween so the parade was villain themed (7pm). You'll want to get there early for a good seat. At 8pm there are fireworks over the castle, so stick around. We mostly went for the rides so I cadon't really comment on the characters as previous people have. We did enjoy the rides and this time of year the queues are quite short. I think 30mins was our longest queue but most were only 5 10mins. I recommend sticking around after the parade and riding a few more rides. Dodon't leave right then as half the park does, so transportation must be hell then. We left 40mins later and it was a breeze (ps  ride the runaway cars in the dark!) I also recommend downloading the HK Disney app. It gives you a map and the wait time of all rides in real time. Food: We did eat burgers at the park. While expensive I would say it was average price for an amusement park. Both ours were tasty. We also got popcorn for the parade and that was really good! Transportation: dodon't waste your money on cab fees to get here. It's quite manageable on the subway, just ask your hotel concierge and they'll direct you. Besides hopping on the Disney line to get there starts the magical experience. ",5
The halloween event was amazing. Book thru Klook to get discounts on tickets. Suggest getting the meal coupon to save on costs. You can use the meal coupon in most restaurants.,5
I went to Hongkong with my Family and it was the most memorable vacation ever. I enjoyed all the places we've been through. The food was great and i love the noodles!! It was a great experience riding their train and going out for a Night Market. The prices were cheap and you can do bargains. We enjoyed our Disneyland Tour and 1 whole day is not enough to visit all the attractions inside.. You must bring extra battery for your cameras for you will be astounded by the beauty of the places.,5
Super destination for both kids and adults. I took a leaf out of ine of the bloggers and it helped us a lot. Please book the tickets through klook or other similar apps. They have great options including meals at disneyland. Makes it really cost effectiveThe best option is to see the entire disneyland in one day and it is possible!!!First check out all the best rides and plan them accordingly...dont target the rides or events as soon as you enter....make a list and then tick each that you pass through....look for the fast pass options on select rides and use it wisely...with this plan you will be able to finish all the rides and attractions...wait till fireworks because it is a must and then depart with happy memories,5
"If your going to the night parade, it only covers half of the rotunda, make sure your on the right side",5
Disneyland as usual was a treat to the kids and the adults in the family too. The staff is ever helpful and friendly. The rides are great. The Disney story book theater is a wonderful addition to the musical shows and parades in Disneyland. Also the special Halloween parade was an additional treat.,5
Our 2nd day was spent at Disney Land HK! got our discounted ticket online. From the mtr line customized for Disneyland to the entrance gets you more excited. We went there 10:30 am and the queue was still fast. There are many shops inside. Though your old and entered Disneyland you'll feel the kid at heart. 1 day is not enough to visit this place. My heart left in Disneyland and we'll surely visit the place again!,5
"Despite a few sections of the Park that was closed for renovation, Disneyland is still a solid choice for a day's worth of magical fun! 1. I went on a weekday and almost all the rides had a waiting time of less than 5minutes. 2. Was disappointed to discover that the Buzz Lightyear ride was decommissioned. However, my absolute favorite is still Mystic Manor. 3. Food is expensive, but still reasonable. 4. There are water fountains at some designated spots, so you can fill your bottles there. 5. This was my second time visiting Disneyland HK, so 1 day is enough. Highly recommend first timer to get the 2 days pass so you can enjoy the park at a leisurely pace. 6. Currently under Halloween theme, and i didnt like the Halloween parades (both the afternoon and evening sessions) as much as the usual one. The usual parade has a lot more fan favorite characters, better music, more colorful, longer duration, and more magical.",5
Spend 2 days here. Do take note popular rides queue can be about 2 hours long. Must watch all shows especially the parade. Do look out for the Disney Characters to take pictures with.And also prepared to shop for souvenirs; lots of souvenirs shop.Stay for the fireworks at the end; nicest fireworks I ever watch.Overall: need 2 days to cover all things. ,5
"Hong Kong Disneyland aims to make you feel happy, energetic, take in as much as you can see, and enjoy the experience",5
Excellent place if you are visitng with your family and children. Keep a full day in hand. Lots of things to see around,5
A wonderful magical park with very clean and lovely surroundings . This park has all usual things we expect from disney. Highly recommended,5
We   ve been here twice but still enjoyed every single thing about disney.. Planing to go back again this coming Christmas with family.,5
Disneyland Hongkong is a magical place where kids and adults alike enjoy the various activities that it offers. One day is not enough to enjoy this place.,5
"Tips:Download the hong kong disneyland app, have internet card and carry a power bank.The app has everything including it shows the location where you are so if you want drinking water, or find restarurant or find toilet all you have to do is check in the app and move in the direction.It also has all the shows, attractions and also the wait times. It also shows where a disney character will be available for photo shoot and at what time. Except for jungle safari where the wait time was more than that shown and can be skipped if more wait time all other attractions were simple to manage. Jungle safari showed 20mins but our line was for English and it took 30mins to 1 hour. Skip this unless waiting time shows 10mins.We saw all the shows including the parades, did all the attractions which we wanted to do in 2 days just because of the app.For small children:Its a small world, Mickey and the wonderous book must do. Winnie the PoohFor all:Mickey Phillauri, Festival of the lion king(though i felt a little bored as similar to carnival)Flights of fantasy parade at 1.30   Excellant.Villians night out at 7   Excellant8pm last show Disney fireworks was good but too much crowded. Better to stand at the back and watch than sit in the front behind someone.Other not to be missed:Iron man experience and photo with iron man.Star wars(Not for faint hearted)Fantasyland where you can meet Winnie, Tigger, many princesses, Tinker bell in fairy tale forest.Tarzan's treehouse.Mystic manor.For big children and adultsHaunted house  Being disney's it was more entertaining than haunted. We laughed all the way out. My children though were little scared.Its a whole new world. You will hear this and sing this for many days even after you come back from Disneyland. Its so enchanting and everyone in the carnival parade are so enthusiastic along with the excellant music that its infectious and you feel like dancing in the parade.They have seperate stroller parking areas everywhere where parents can keep their strollers when they carry their kids inside for the shows.All food and drink is on the higher side here so carry water with you(There is drinking water inside so you may carry a bottle and refill it whenever needed) and they do check the bags at security but considerable food is still allowed inside. Checking is for sharp objects etc. but they do understand that Disneyland is for kids so parents are going to carry food inside. Not that strict for that.",5
How can you miss Disneyland if you are in Hong Kong? Not if you have kids (and kid at heart) in the family. Been here for 5 or 6 times for the last 12 years and it is always an amazing experience. Tip: If you have young kids (7years and lower) its a good idea to get a 2day pass so you can enjoy the park at your own pacing. Not rushing every ride attraction.Do not miss the fireworks esp around Christmas time. ,5
"Amazing experience that we all had fantasies about. when you are  in  Disneyland, your are a child again and  that  is  the  best  way to  enjoy your  day..",5
"What can I say? Its Disneyland! If you have not been to one, this might be THE ONE for you. Its probably the most affordable one.Its great fun, everyone smiles inside, the rides are fun, 3D 4D movies are WOW. Dont miss the end of day parade at 0700pm and the fireworks at 0800pm! Disney sure knows how to put on a show.Whether you are going alone, with your love, or as a family, this place has something for everyone.",5
"I believe this is the smallest Disneyland in the world. However it has everything that are offered in other Disneyland. It's better to visit during non holiday weekdays. Or it will be wasting time on waiting in line unless you have the fast pass which will help a bit. Limited time, limited budget, in Asia, want to see all Disney cartoon characters, this is a good option.",5
My husband and I did a day trip to Disneyland on a Saturday. The park was absolutely incredible and not too busy! Wait times were very reasonable for rides. We were told that the park is quieter at this time of year as school holidays have ended. The variety and price of food was great. You must try a Mickey Waffle they are delicious! I was also very impressed with the cleanliness of the park and amenities there was not a spot of rubbish. I would definitely visit again. Price and availability of souvenirs also excellent.,5
"This one is not too big land and if you visit in weekday you can enjoy all with not too much for a queue. All staff are lively and friendly. Only a restaurant there, food are expensive and not good. At night i love a firework at sleeping beauty's castle! It's beautiful.",5
"I visited with my family. We stayed at Holiday Iin express,a cheap and nice hotel. HK Disneyland is a perfect place to visit with your family and remeber to check the schedule for shows and attraction.",5
"1 full day was about right for me to go through most of the attractions. Many of the rides are very engaging and interactive. But if you are looking for more high elements scary rides, this may not be the best place to go.Love the night show and fireworks, and the halloween theme decorations and performances.",5
This place is amazing  You need to spend 2 days here to see it all  We did 3 4 of a day and only seen 1 4 of the park  Get there early and pre buy your tickets so you dodon't have to wait,5
"It was short walk from transport line arrival was easy. Park is not the biggest but its great if you have small kids not long wait times for rides. Park was very clean, we did the park in 1 day but we did have a 2 day pass so we went half day next day and did the stuff we most liked. Staff are very friendly and happy to help. Lots of stores to buy from",5
"Our first Disneyland experience and we were not disappointed. It has current expansion work going on which I recommend was complete to get a 2 day pass as it is big enough to experience 2 days of fun! Everyone was friendly and helpful, go during weekday when quiet and start your day there at 10am. Wonderful family day! ",5
"From the start it is an adventure! From the sunny bay MTR train station there is the Disney train that goes straight to the park. You could take a taxi but the train completes the Disney experience here. You should take the train. One comes every 3 mins.While quite a bit smaller than Disney in Orlando, FL, this Disney packs a lot of great things in. It has tons of great rides for the small ones and everyone else, including tea cups and dumbo. There is also Space Mountain but it is Star Wars themed and SUPER cool!!! Our favourite ride by far!!! It's like being in the scenes of the death Star battle with Tie fighters and x wings zooming in every direction. Our 7yo son thought it was a bit loud and fast but this was the first rollercoaster he has ever been on.We all really enjoyed the jungle boat ride  our guide was very funny! Tarzana tree house was also a favourite.Get your pictures with Micky, Minie, Cinderella, and all the Star Wars characters too !!!!We went on a Wednesday at 11 and it was great bc it was not crowded and we waited only 5 mins to get on rides!!!! That's almost unheard of!!!!The castle is small but still cool to see. We diddon't stay for the parade. It would have made for too long a day. We live near Disney here in HK and get the pleasure is seeing the fireworks over the water every night. It's always cool to see!It's a great park with lots of great rides and things to do!!",5
"We first visited this hotel 2 years ago. Once again we had a wonderful holiday, with the hotel exceeding itself.Stayed Concierge level, which was well worth the extra cost. We received fast passes for every day plus daily priority entry to the first Storybook show (which was wonderful, albeit slightly weird with Goofy, Mickey and Olaf talking in Chinese, with songs being sung in English).Breakfast was plentiful, as was the evening food. The free wine and beer each evening was very welcome and relaxing after a day exploring or visiting the park. Having Mickey, Minnie or Daisy duck visit the lounge in their pyjamas each evening was quant and something I wish Disneyworld did. Both children and adults got into the swing of things and turned up in their PJs!Was able to explore the 2 other hotels, and if we wanted to could use their facilities. The only negative was a lack of a restaurant bar at the pool. Having to order room service which took an hour was not ideal. There was a jug of water by the pool   s entrance, but sometimes water will not do, so we ended up getting dried and dressed a few times and going to the lounge just to have a cup of tea. For some reason none of the 3 hotels appeared to have food facilities at the pool     something I have not encountered before.Tip     by the annual pass for the park     we did and got a good reduction in room prices, discount at park restaurants and on shopping     well worth the money and the tickets are dirt cheap compared the Disneyworld!Can   t wait to visit again, hopefully in a year or two.",5
"The access to Disneyland Hong Kong is easy, using MTR using Orange Line (Tung Chung) and stop to Sunny Bay station, change to Disney MTR with Mickey and Minnie Mouse style. The ticket is average price. We are recommended for the Book Story Teller, stage performance is very excellent (we have 3 times watch this). Also the new attraction like Starwars roller coaster maybe will shock you, and Iron Man also Marvel's Agent SHIELD will cheers you up.",5
"Visited on a week day in September and we had an amazing day. The park was really quiet and we did not wait in any lines all day. We arrived on the train at about 10am for a 10:30am opening and we breezed straight through the bag checks and joined the lines to get in. They opened Main Street early for some shopping which was perfect as we had the chance to scope out some purchases for later in the day. Most of the park opened at 10:30 and we headed straight to Adventureland to ride Jungle Cruise. They have the option for several different languages which is great for visitors that dodon't speak English. We then waited a few minutes for Grizzly Gulch to open and headed for a few rides on that and then Mystic Manor. They had an interactive marvel attraction thing happening which was good. Without giving a full run down of the day we pretty much managed everything we wanted to go on and saw all the parades, fireworks and special Halloween happenings. The magic book show was brill. I think it's a bit disappointing that they cancel Paint the Night for Halloween as the Halloween parade was average in comparison. Tomorrowland is a little sad at the minute with all of the renovations but we loved the Iron Man experience, a nice evolution of star tours. Overall a great day, this Disney park is one of my favourites and the merchandise was way better than Shanghai Disneyland. ",5
"We went there with 2 day pass bought together with a 2 night stay at Disney Hollywood Hotel (on separate review on TripAdvisor). There was a separate line for in house guests and day visitors at the entrance. One day is enough if you plan to just roam around the park. But those who would like to ride all the rides and witness all the live shows cannot do it all in one day since the waiting time range from 20 60 minutes and there are a lot of great attractions inside the park. I highly suggest you wear your most comfortable footwear because you will be on your feet for hours.The live shows gave me chills because it brought back a lot of childhood memories. My salute and respect to all the talents!The food was a little bit pricey but its serving is big enough for a parent to share with a child. Our favorite restaurant was Explorer's Club. Water is quite expensive there so better bring a water bottle you can refill from water fountains near comfort rooms. Speaking of comfort rooms, every attraction has a CR with many cubicles and tissue papers. There are also defibrillators located near every comfort rooms. When visiting with children, the park has strollers for rent. And they have a station for lost children where you can report a missing child (heaven forbids!). Overall experience was amazing except for the time my sister notice to have lost her iphone. She reported it to the park's  city hall  but no words about it until we board our plane back home.Despite that, we had the best of time of our lives.",5
This is the third Disneyland I have visited and this was the easiest to navigate.  It is small but offers all the rides.  The grounds are lush and green.  it was very hot when we were there but there was plenty of shade too.,5
"Totally loves it apart from the heat and humidity . A lot of rides are air conditioned. Those that aren   t need to be fixed up. Lots of rides that accommodate little kids but the fast track passes need to cover all rides , not just a few. Worth getting fast track passes though, it was a godsend that we had them included in our stay at Disney   s Explorers Lodge Resort. Very stroller friendly but the park needs more baby care facilities dotted across the whole park and not just on Main Street. Loved it and will come again one day. ",5
"One of my most visited Disneyland cos it   s nearer to where I was coming. With the newly additions, it makes the visit more worth compared to 2 years back.  Must try the iron man ride and small small world.",5
"We have a 4 year old and we bought a two day pass using the Klook app. I love HK Disney because of its small size, it was easy to get around and see everything. The rides are wonderful and the shows were amazing. We especially loved festival of the lion king. There are potable water stations near the washrooms where you can refill bottles. This is such a wonderful feature! Disappointments: I was disappointed that character greetings were marked on the brochure but when we went, there weredon't any characters there. Some rides have no shaded area to stand in. Advice: bring an umbrella to make your own shade..... this will make or break your day. I hope you go and have a fun day!! ",5
We bought our tickets at the gate and we're concerned at the length of the queues but everything moved quickly and smoothly.Staff are helpful and friendly. we went on the Hyperspace mountain ride first off only 15 mins wait   in air conditioning. Then Iron Man experience about 20 min wait. It stormed and rain heavily during the day but the park kept the as many rides open as they could. We ate lunch by the Iron Man experience. It was good quality tasty fresh food. It was served quickly and we really enjoyable. We queue for a food rides but the lines move quickly and loads are air conditioned waiting areas. We stayed on to see the Halloween parade   it was all in Chinese but the costumes and performers were excellent. The train ride back to Sunny Bay and the whole experience was enjoyable. ,5
Talk about being a kid again... Disneyland will still and always be the happiest place on Earth. Hyperspace Mountain is my favorite ride. I cried during the Flights of Fantasy Parade seeing my childhood virtual playmates come to life. The festival of yhe Lion King was definitely a hit! And of course the fireworks is a much watch. We booked through Klook for discounted tickets and it was definitely a great choice. ,5
"Great to see Micky Mouse, and several Disney Characters.  Had a chance to see Cinderella.  Had rides on boat passing thru lots of Disney attractions, characters, music, etc.  Enjoyed watching the parade of Disney Characters and the fireworks at 8pm.  We will be back here.",5
Kids will love this place with all the rides and characters (as with any disney property). Food choices are limited though (even though there a tens of outlets   the selection is pretty limited for non Asian   read Chinese   people). All in all a wonderful experience.,5
"Park has its own train station and very easy to access using Hong Kong's very efficient MTR network. We enjoyed the free show called Lion King festival that showcased story of Lion King cast of many talented people and impressive stage not to miss the lady in the trapeze, fire dancer and huge puppets. Must see when visiting this park. Only downside is most food stall and restaurants opens from 12 noon so best to bring food and drinks for your kids to make sure there will be fuel for the before you can buy anything.",5
"Hong Kong Disneyland is the best!      I really enjoy the shows, rides and other amazing experiences. I was amazed with the type of enjoyment they bring to all visitors from different countries. Will go back soon.",5
So much fun in one day! Go on a weekday as the queues are not long (longest we found was 20 minutes). I'd also suggest you go at opening time. Best rides were Space Mountain (Star Wars themed!) and Grizzly Gulch Runaway Mine Cars. Ironman is also spectacular. Fireworks that close the park are great. Dodon't miss! Something for everyone!,5
One of the main objective of my HK trip is to head there with my GF. Huge locations with various Disney theme places. Lots to buy definitely but the stations are either for kids or a huge disappointment after a long queue. 1 hour was wasted due to the rain but we persevere. Restrooms are not the easiest to locate,5
This is a fabulous destination that offers something for all ages and fitness levels. The older kids loved the big thrill rides. The time of the year we visited was very hot but the up side was there were very few queues for the rides allowing the kids to ride each ride a few times before moving to the next ride. Loved the atmosphere and the high standards of presentation throughout the park. Highly recommended.,5
Decided to use the short school break to bring my child here. Stayed at Disneyland hotel which too was a great experience. Beats five star hotels in price and comfort. The park was a great balance of good rides and accessible distances.,5
This place will definitely brings out the child in you. Its a magical place that can make everyone believe in fairytales. Its a place where anyone will definitely enjoy! Disneyland is the place where everyone can believe that everything is possible. Its the happiest place ineed.However I enjoyed the experience very much on my first visit because the parade on a regular day is full of amazing lights in the evening. But I think when there is an occasion like halloween the parade of all the Disney characters happened in the afternoon and at the night parade is for the villains. Though at least I got try the normal and the halloween themed Disneyland ,5
I went to Disneyland on 29th September. I arrived at the park entrance around 9am and there's no crowd. The first attraction I rode was Star Wars and it's great.,5
It was nice also the 3D movies where so exciting. The food was great and the night parade with fireworks where awesome.,5
"We had a great day at Disneyland. Only downside was the stifling heat, a breeze would have made this far more bearable. Lines were ok for rides",5
"This really best Disneyland!!! It's good size no line not many people. easy shopping, see parade! You can spend time all day for 1 day!                                                                                    1                                                         5                                                                                                                                                                           ",5
"Spent the day with my 6 yr & 3 yr old. Awesome fun. Very efficient. Very clean. Well maintained. Very safe. Fireworks worth staying for at the end of the day around 8pm. Just very very hot   to be expected   lots of sunblock, hats and water needed. ",5
"A magical place, as all the Disneylands. We have been in Disneyworld Orlando and Shanghai Disneyland before Hongkong, so the size of the iconic castle was a surprise for us   it was so small compared to others. When we visited here, it was Halloween time which was nice. Also, no long queues on Tuesday (september 2017).",5
"Hot but super fun place for any ages. Get your map just right after u enter the gate, complimentary water is available at some spots, mostly near toilets, avoid crowded of weekend visiting. Lion king show is spectacular, and dodon't miss Mickey and the Wondrous Book Show. Fireworks in front of princess castle at night.",5
"If you are after a place to take your little kids then this is the place! We went the week before Hong Kong school holidays (26th 27th Sept) and the longest we waited for any ride was about 6 minutes.This time of year is hot.... really really hot and super humid!...BUT! There is a lot of indoor rides that a deliciously air conditioned!You cannot take food or drink in and you WILL be bag searched before entry. Selfie sticks are banned (thank god) but there will be thousands of japanese photographing themselves EVERYWHERE! On the bus, on rides, in toilets every f@ $%ng where! If you are staying at any of the Disney hotels you can rent a stroller pram for your little ones from the hotel for $100HK per day and take it on the shuttle and into the theme park. Although you will not be able to take it on the Disney train because it doesdon't fold up.Food is reasonably priced as far as theme parks go and they cater for a very diverse community, so lots of choice!If your kids like ANYTHING Disney from mickey to iron man they will love this place and you for taking them there",5
"One day is not enough if you have kids and you want to concur the map, atleast 2 days, halal food is easy to get, wifi is all over the park AND PLS DONT FORGET TO REGISTER YOUR EMAIL TO GET HKD10 OFF EVERY PURCHASE, YOU CAN USE IT UNLIMITED ON THE DAY ITSELF! ",5
"Located in Lantau Island, Hongkong Disneyland has always been dubbed as one of the most magical places on earth! Yes, it is truly magical as you will be seeing a lot of Disney characters you might have watched (and sometimes, your favorites)   from Princesses, to figure character and more! You will be able to meet your favorite Disney characters, watch live shows and parades, and shop and dine at all themed areas of the Hong Kong Disneyland park! HK Disneyland is accesible both via train, car and buses! Making it always on top of the lists whenever tourist planned going to Hongkong. HK Disneyland yet being so magical, is so HUGE that even (i think) a day pass would not be sufficient enough to pay a visit and enjoy everything it has to offer. They got a lot of attractions, interactive, inviting and most of all exciting.TIPS:1. Book your ticket in advance. Though getting ticket on the day itself would be fine, just to ensure you are able to manage potential hassle, I would highly suggest to book your tickets ahead. They got 1 Day Disney E Ticket ranging from $70.00 to $75.00 and 2 Day Disney E Ticket ranging from $90.00 to $97.00. These are e tickets that can be purchased online. Once redeemed your voucher for your physical ticket, you must enter Disneyland within 3 days. For 2 day tickets, your first entry must be within 3 days, the second within 7 days of the first visit. Child tickets will be sold to children within the age of 3 11.2. Check the weather. There are chances HK is in rainy season, so you might want to prepare your Rain Gears! If the weather is sunny, make sure you have sunscreen protection, sunglassed or umbrella. 3. Water is a must! You need to get a hand on a bottle water as surely you will be having loads of walk!4. HK Disneyland is so big and it is advisable to always refer to the maps provided on the entrance. As Disneyland also provides wi fi, might as well download their app (IOS and Android) for better schedules of attractions. better attraction timings such as meeting disney characters and show times. 5. Between 2:30pm to 3:00pm (Local Time) they are hosting parade of colors which will give you a glimpse of the different disney colors.6. Between 6:00 to 6:30pm (Local Time) you will be able to witness Parade of Lights! I absolutely love this one   very stunning and spectacular.7. I suggest you stay for the entire day as by 7:30pm, you will be able to watch with awe the spectacular fireworks display to cap the day!Enjoy!!!",5
"Disney is my childhood, sooooo i really love this place. The attraction is cool with the theme. There   s a halal food too here, and also a prayer room (musholla) at Explorer Restaurant (Mystic Zone).",5
"The park is small and the weather was very unpredictable. The facilities are very mild (since Disney is mostly for kids) and not exciting. Yet the performances were very impressive, especially the Wondrous Book!",5
"A place must visit for all age range people! It is suggest to go for 2 days pass because definitely one day is not enough to see all spectacular disneyland. There are free stroller available for kids. Every park has restaurant and toilet, so no worries. Lot of shades and chairs for old people to sit and relax. The park if full of FUN!",5
"I wasdon't sure what to expect as I have not been to any of the Disney parks since I was a small child. On a whim my adult son and I decided to spend a day at Hong Kong Disneyland and we were not disappointed. Because we went last week when most children were in school, we did not have to wait in line for any rides which was great. There are not a ton of rides at this park but what they did have we enjoyed and we were able to do the whole park in one day without rushing around. My particular favorite rides were the Star Wars themed hyper Space Mountain and the Mystic Manor ride.I understand that this is the smallest of the Disney parks and as adult I found it relaxing and fun. I am not 100% sure that older children would be as captivated but this park is really a great size for families with smaller children. With Disney having Marvel & Star Wars rides now  I think that teenagers will be into the Disney parks too and if Disneyland Hong Kong adds more of these type rides they will get the teenagers excited about Disneyland Hong Kong too.Food was decent, the walk in ticket price was good considering I spent the whole day exploring and riding rides. The firework show was quite lovely too. Also I managed to go on the first day of the Halloween themed parades and the Hong Kong Disney Haunted House  Maze of Madness: The Nightmare Experiment Continues. Since I LOVE Halloween this was a bonus surprise. All in all I loved my first experience at a Disney park as an adult.",5
We bought a 2 day pass online for a very reasonable price. Very easy to print pass or access via code through phone. Worth going about half hour before opening time at least once to see opening ceremony and get some pictures with characters on Main Street. We were lucky enough to be visiting during the Tsum Tsum Fun Fair 2017. You pay extra to participate in games where you get and can win exclusive Tsum Tsum. Staff get very excited when people win. It was fun just to have a go. During the 2 days we never waited more than 5 10 minutes for a ride and on most occasions walked straight onto the rides. Fast passes not needed at this time of year. Mystic Manor is a must do. The Lion King Show and Mickey and the magical book were also good. Pin trading is available around the park but diddon't observe many people doing so. Halloween activities were also on while we were there. All free. The maze was fun but scary for little people but not in English. Halloween Villain parade was great fun. Watch out for coupons when making purchases in the park. Would happily visit this park again.,5
A little disappointed for the teenagers. There are not a lot of rides so they were ready to go within hours. On the other hand we also gave a 4yr old and what a day she had. It was such an experience she loved it! If you have been to the US Disneylands this is definitely the poor cousin especially if you have older children. Book your tickets on KLOOK. Make sure to include the restaurant voucher it's worth it with a big group. ,5
The Disneyland Hong Kong is very nice you can spell a good time with children are they have a really big place to enjoy with the children spend a good time with them children to enjoy it because there are various characters on the streets which amazes the children it's a good place for them you can enjoy it too,5
"My husband and I have visited all of the Disney parks with the exception of Shanghai. HK Disneyland is small compared to the other parks, but it has lots of surprises that make it a real gem. We visited HK Disneyland on a Wednesday. Compared to the other parks, it felt like we were the only ones there. We walked into almost every ride. We diddon't bother with Fast Passes or our resort Priority Passes. Not sure if this is the norm, but it was nice. The park as a whole was very clean (as to be expected) and even in the stifling heat humidity the cast members and parade performers put on an impressive and enthusiastic show.I'm an avid fan of the Haunted Mansion. When I read about Mystic Manor, I was a little disappointed that it would not be the classic experience that I have grown to love. However, MM really blew us away. It was lighthearted and adorable. Albert is so cute. We ended up doing this attraction twice. Space Mountain seemed slower and less impressive than the other parks, but it was still fun. We walked right onto the ride, so that helped.I love Star Wars and was skeptical of the Iron Man Experience existing in place of Star Tours. Again, we walked right onto the ride, but the items they have on display in the queue seem like they would be interesting to examine and would help to pass the time if there were to be a line. The ride was fun and it excited into a ship full of Avengers merch. The Halloween decorations were cute of course. I was very impressed with Toy Story Land. All in all, I'm very glad we used our extended layover to visit HK Disneyland and Resort. It's worth it if you're a Disney fan. ",5
If going to Hong Kong worth a visit as a Disneyland visit never disappoints stay in one of the Disneyland hotels to get the most out of the theme park experience,5
"Will never get tired of HK disneyland. Visited this as a solo traveler last October 2016 and I will be back in Feb 2018 with family to celebrate my nephews first birthday. To those who plan to visit, make sure you know the schedule of the parades and make sure you wait for the fireworks display!!! It is indeed, magical!",5
"This is my very first disney experience, and it is really a WOW. HK disneyland is already 12 years old, but the place doesdon't look old. You will see the hard work of the cast staff, to make you feel happy.       I recommend you guys to buy tickets using the Klook App, they really give out awesome discounts. ",5
A year ago we were given the chance to visit this wonderful place for everyone . Hongkong Disneyland is the most accessible Disney place we can ever visit since from The Philippines it is just 2 hours away and we were given the opportunity to travel with friends and new found friends . It was a nice place for kids and kids at heart. We might go back and bring along our children so we can enjoy the moment with them . Money is an issue but if you really want to experience this kind of adventure might as well start saving from now so you would be able to reach a goal of fulfillment . What are you waiting for . Lets visit Hongkong Disneyland and feel like a child again for just a day or two .,5
"You cadon't go wrong with Disneyland! We had a great time here. It's smaller than other locations we've visited, but we still had a lot of fun. It's a great one day trip. Train stop begins and departs a short walking distance from the entrance. It wasdon't overly crowded and we never had to wait long for any of the rides. Food was excellent for a theme park! Parade was fun, but too long to stand in the hot sun and heat. Hong Kong is very hot and humid. Our tour guide on the Jungle River Cruise was hilarious and made the ride fun. Our favorite ride was the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. Some restaurants and rides were closed, but it diddon't spoil our fun.",5
"It is although a small Disneyland given the size of US & Paris Disneyland, but it is still a gem of a place.You are transported to your childhood and you certainly enjoy that.Disney Parks is an experience and you certainly get that in HK Disneyland. Some of the amazing things which we saw were in the limited time we had: All the shows are just amazing, missing the shows will be a crime if you are visiting Disneyland as Rides are good but nothing compared to Ocean Park.So, disneyland visit should be enjoyed as an experience because the shows are amazing including Lion king show, Minnie magic, Daily parade etc etc. All are just amazing.Although it is not that the rides are just not enjoyable, some rides are breadth of fresh air just like Iron Man experience, Star wars ride and many other also.If you have not visited any other Disneypark then you definitely will not be disappointed.One day is good to explore the complete place.Enjoy the trip!",5
"First thing first, you need to have the flyers on the Disneyland before you go for tour in the park. Every sites has its own shows or attractions that not to be missed. You need to study the schedule listed so you will not missed the excitements. If you are looking for a halal food, there's an indicator in the flyer for the halal restaurants and kiosk.There's also a prayer room for you to perform your solah located at the back of the restaurant they even has ablution area in the room. Please be there from morning and wait until the finale of the night i.e. the parade and the fireworks. Disneyland has added a number of new attractions in the park.You can go there by MTR as it is already connected right to Disneyland.",5
"first of all, it's not as small as everyone is saying. it is huge and worth the visit! most of the rides designed for families of all ages to try and the other ones they allow kids if accompanied by parents.the shows are amazing .happy happy vibes must visit! ",5
Reach early to enjoy the fulfilled disneyland hongkong. Full day of entertainment with parade's & fire works & lot more. Photos with disney cartoon characters.,5
"Grew up dreaming to be a disney princess. Been here for 3 times already, plan your day. Prioritize the rides and shows that you want to experience. And again, food prices!!!!!! Had 1 sandwich for the whole day!! I know such a cheapskate. Well! If you have kids,read this somewhere, buy disney merch outside and give it to your kids during your visit. They'll never know :)",5
I had  a fantastic day. There were no long lines I had a fun day  .the ride were more  for young people. But I still would  recommend it,5
"had so much fun at disneyland hk,,,, i love the grizzly gulch and buzz lightyear ride!will back soon with my children",5
Hong Kong Disneyland may be small but it doesdon't lack the picks and punches the thrills and the rides of it's more gigantic counterparts in Los Angeles Tokyo or Paris!They are an all service packed in fun filled theme park with the wonderful shows and rides Good for a full day of fun with the family,5
"You are never too old for Disneyland, and we had a blast here! The rides were awesome! Especially the Star Wars ride. We walked through the different lands and went on all of the rides we could. An awesome day! One exhibit was closed, but one out of everything was fine! ",5
Our time at Disney was memorable there's lots of queues but they are moving. The R1000 entry ticket was worth it even though it's their lunch at the restaurant is a bit pricey. The souvenir shops are reasonable although selling similar things.,5
"My daughter and I loved this place. We went on so many rides and had such a fantastic day. It's a little older, but that just means the crowds are smaller. Everything is so easy to get to and the new Star Wars and Iron Man rides exhibits were brilliant. We loved our day here so much.",5
"I visited on a Friday in September with limited time left in my itinerary. I expected crowds and a lot of waiting. Well I was so wrong! Judging from other reviews, September must be an ideal time to visit. We literally walked onto every ride in the park with little to no waiting. Whilst there are not a huge number of rides in this park, it was the ideal amount for us to be able to feel like we were easily able to do everything that we wanted to without any stress and still make our flight out. I would strongly advise using the MTR system to get to Disneyland. It is quick and cost effective. A big plus is the Disney train line! We made the mistake of catching a taxi to Disneyland where it cost us 10x the amount and we got caught in heavy traffic. The MTR was a lot less stressful.The 3:30 parade was a lot of fun, even for adults! Mystic Manor was my favourite ride of the day.The downside was that a number of restaurants and 2 rides were closed and I think it would have been even more fun with children!",5
"From Tsim Sha Tsui, we took MTR (Tsuen Wan Line) until Lai King, 9th stop. Changed train, took Tung Chung Line until Sunny Bay, 2nd stop. Transferred to 3rd train, pink one, and viola...Disneyland! Of course the train was almost full. But no worry, there is one every 5 minutes. We went on a saturday, and just from the train, I was sure that thousands would be enjoying the resort that day. We bought food before entering the gates, @70HKD each meal. Yummy! Just along the road getting inside. Lined up for inspection, and take note you're not allowed to bring meals, only snack is allowed inside. Starting from Moby Dick, picture taking starts. As soon as you enter the gates, you are greeted by Mickey Mouse on the lawn! No phone sticks are allowed! Start with Tomorrowland, then Adventure land, Toy Story, etc etc...One whole day is not enough. You go there with battery full, and end up with battery empty. At 7pm, the Paint the Night Parade will really awaken all energy hiding inside of you coupled with the Fireworks. You line up for another 3 train rides telling yourself that you need to go back the next year!",5
"My family and I went to HK Disneyland to celebrate our mom's birthday in advance last thursday, Sept.08, 2017 (though her bday is on sept.15       ). We're all excited coz its our first Disneyland experience and the place was really magical and amazing It caters to all ages! We enjoyed the Ironman experience, Big grizzly mountain runaway mine car, and Hyper space mountain! Also, its a must see the spectacular show of the Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book We also recommend the happiest cruise that ever sailed, the Its a Small World as kids will definitely will enjoy it Magical world of Disney exceeded our expectation as not only will kids will love it but also the people like us who's always a kid at heart        We ended our day as we saw the highlights of our Disney experience with spectacular and magical fireworks!! We will try the Tokyo Disneyland on our next family adventure soon       ",5
"I wasdon't sure I wanted to go to Disney in Hong Kong as there's so much to do and there wasdon't as many rides as some of the other parks. My boyfriend wanted to go and I'm so glad we did. This is one of the best Disneys I've been to. I'm not sure if it was the time of year (we went in June   and on a weekday) but the park wasdon't that busy. We waited 25 mins max for probably 2 rides. The Big Grizzly Mountain mine car ride was brilliant, the queue was actually so short we were able to get off the ride and walk round to ride again and be almost straight on. We did the same with Space Mountain. We bought a ticket which included a meal at a restaurant, this was a good value and the food wasdon't bad. Getting here is so simple. Take the metro to Tsing Yi and change at Sunny Bay. From here you can catch the Disney train. It took us about an hour to get there from Tin Hau, and for about   5 each way.Such a worthwhile day out if you're visiting Hong Kong",5
"Hong Kong is incomplete without visiting Disneyland, this is one of the best Disneyland I have been to, I enjoyed every moment of it. Everyone should go and enjoy the experience, out of everything I did in Hong Kong, I had the most fun over here.",5
The Hong Kong Disneyland is small comparing to the other Disney Parks in the world but it is very beautiful and full of magic. Some of the rides are the same as in other Disneylands the other rides are completely different and unique. We really enjoyed Big Grizzly Mountain Runway Mine Cars and The Mystic Manor.We had a absolutely magical day in the Park,5
Loved the place. Visited with my kids aged 13 and 10. Spent 2 whole days at the place. Better if  you stay at hotel on the premises.  Be prepared with lots of water and umbrellas.,5
"Perfect for little people, our daughter is 4.5years.We went during school holidays, was really busy, but worth it. Was a super hot day so the umbrella we took was well used. Queue times for photos were lengthy (we waited 1hr20mins for minnie and mickey) as the day goes by. You can hire kids strollers. Pick this up as soon as you can. The heat and all the walking is hard on little people. Wish we had bought iceblocks earlier in the day!!!Enjoy",5
"Though the weather wasdon't was in our favour the ides and environment was breathtaking. When the Thunderstorm warning was on the outdoor rides were stopped. But the indoor rides and shows were on, which was good.",5
"There was a typhoon when we visited HK Disneyland last June, and the outdoor rides weredon't open. So I only got to enjoy the indoor rides, but then they closed early. And yet, they gave us a free complimentary HK DIsneyland ticket. I went the next day, and the outdoor rides were open already. I suggest to go on a Weekday instead. ",5
 We went on a Sunday. The average waiting time for each ride is about 5 10 minutes. The queue for photography with the Disney characters can be up to an hour long. Most rides are suitable for children.  The fireworks show at 8.30pm is spectacular and a must do activity. You can get a stamp on your arm and return to Disneyland after dinner or a short rest.  A meal at Disneyland will cost about HKD 100. A drink or snack will cost about HKD 30. I strongly recommend all visitors to download the disneyland app so as to check on waiting time at rides and to navigate your way in and around the place. ,5
"great place. though the food are a little expensive. if you go here, i recommend you to stay until the fireworks.",5
Very good place for family. But alittle hot. So umbrella needed. The food is great but pricy. Recommend to go on week day so the people are not so crowd. Easy to travel to by mte sunnybay station,5
We visit Disney everytime we go to HKG. They always have something new every 2 3 years making each visit exciting.  For first timers i recommend 2 day pass to fully enjoy the park.,5
"You must have their ice creams. They're the best! There is a special train that goes to Disneyland. If you're a Disney fan or not, this is a must visit.",5
We had a great day at disney hong kong . It is spacious but not crowded with rides and stages. The main street in California and the sleeping beauty castle is always busy in California but in Hong king it is only busy during the parade whichis also not as the California parade but still nice to see it . Rides has long queues but anuway worth waiting as disney rides are really great.kids enjoyed the stage live shows .the festival of lion king and mickey wonderous story book was both amazing and really the airconditined stages are teally great in the hot weather. The electric parade and fire works were nice . Shops have different stuff than California disney land .Meet and greet characters are not the same everyday and hardly you can find disney princesses.mickey and minnie are there almost all the time. It is great to visit hongkong disney park but donr put it in comparison with disneyland or WDW.,5
"Excellent place for all age groups, we enjoyed most of the rides and shows, visited with my children and parents, how day was passed we diddon't  realize. Willing to visit Disneyland again...",5
"We arrived at opening time and the line was long but orderly. We had a great time as a family in the park, I would expect this being Disney. All staff we encountered we friendly and helpful. The place wasdon't really crowded on the day we went as we went mis week. The food was OK but a lot of the carts weredon't opened so we had to walk around looking for snacks.",5
We loved the whole experience and the kids were over the moon to meet most of the characters. Quite full so go prepared for long waits but totally worth it. Stay till after 7 pm to see the night parade and at 9 for the fireworks show,5
"It was my second time here, but this time it was as a parent bring over my 2 year old.It was awesome. Seeing my daughter react to the characters and the shows made the entire trip worth it. Expect a lot of walking. Bring extra shirtS and water. Make use of the line passes that allow you to be in line without having to stand.If you must bring a baby stroller, pack 2 bags. One with your valuables and the other with non essentials. All rides and shows will require you to leave the cart outside, in a baby cart parking lot. Having separate bags will allow you to easily leave the other with the cart outside without having to sort out your things. All in all an awesome day. Was quite tired afterwards but we all had a ton of fun.",5
"Having been to Florida and California Disney World land this is smaller and lacks the memorabilia that the USA ones have on show and around the park, rides are the same, parade was great and the park is very well kept. Pricey for food and drink but so is every Disneyland, less shops and restaurants but enough for its size. Rides pretty much the same but lines not as long as USA. Transport to here via MTR and cab was very easy. Fireworks over the castle were awesome we would come back with our family ",5
"We live in Florida and have been frequent visitors of Disney World there, originally with children and now with grandchildren. We were a little skeptical about the experience we would have at the smaller Disneyland Hong Kong, when we visited it last week, but we were most pleasantly surprised how they have been able to replicate the engaging  Magic  on somewhat smaller but equally entertaining scale. ",5
I came here expecting it to be rammed with people and even though there were a lot the park seemed to cope pretty well with the mass volume of visitors. We caught the MTR to Sunny Bay and then caught the train   this was quite magical as a Disney themed train takes you to the theme park. Trains were very frequent so no waiting around . Queues were not too bad I think the longest was 35 mins which is acceptable in summer holidays . With the busier rides we used a fast track ticket (note there is no extra cost!!) and returned in the given time slot . After 5pm the crowds eased off and rides were easy to get on. Park is very easy to manoeuvre around   not too far to walk from one area to another. All very child friendly the staff very good and helpful   lots speaking very good English too. Top attraction for me was Hyperspace mountain   the children loved the Buzz Light year ride. Also enjoyed the Mystic mansion   great animation here. Watched the Lion King show   wow fantastic my daughter absolutely loved this . We stayed to watch the Night Parade   this was incredible ! Very pretty to see the floats all illuminated . Great Iron man ride if you dodon't get motion sickness   there was no queue here we went straight on . Food   you cadon't take your own food in and they do check your bags at the gate. Park food is expensive that is the downside   be prepared to part with money to buy the Disney brand . There are lots of outlets to eat from   food is  ok  standard . If you are feeling flush I can highly recommend a Disney themed ice cream   they were delicious but $45 a go ! So remember when its busy you can scan you entrance ticket in the fast track machine by the popular rides to get a slot time to return with no queue   there is a list of rides that have this feature on their web site. Great day out at Disney and they give you a nice fireworks display to close off your evening !,5
"We insisted on reaching the place even when it was occasionally physicalThe train ride was an experience in itself. The train with Mickey Mouse characters and my girl was all excited (me too)The park is stunning, invested, the film screened dazzling with smells, wonderful that make the experience extraordinary. All the facilities are great, Winnie the Pooh, the teacups, the parachute, the roller coaster, the restaurants are good.We spent a whole day in Disney Park and I would stay longer.Absolutely stunning and worth every minute",5
"I am so impressed to see Disney Character, I could hardly believe that at my age, I have given the chance to meet & greet Mickey mouse & Disney princesses. Lots of stuff to buy & you'll be amazed of fireworks shows at the night.",5
He is counting the days till next years visit. We stayed in the Disneyland Hotel Kingdom Club and had visits from mickey and mini mouse. He loved the pool and waterslide as well as the maze. Food in Chinese restaurant good but other food was dissappointing in poolside. Club was good for breakfast but limited after that. Staff polite and well trained room ok was priced highet than 5 star top hotels....not sure it was any better than the Hollywood where we stayed last year.,5
"It is smaller than Tokyo Disneyland, but getting a 2 day pass is still a must. Everything about Hongkong Disneyland was fun for our family. The staff were nice (they can speak english relatively fluently), the rides were fun, the shows and parades were great and the food was superb.The only cons about Hong Kong Disneyland is the price (but typical of any theme park).Tips:1. GET A 2 DAY PASS (so you can see all the shows and try out all the rides).2. Be there at rope drop (10:30am) in order to enjoy the entire day in HK Disneyland (the staff and photographers are happier and more energetic in the morning).3. Tell your kids to get stickers from ANY ALL staff member s early in the day (by late afternoon, they run out of stickers).4. If you will get the photopass, dodon't forget to ask the staff with cameras that are roaming around to take your picture (the day pass is worth it if you maximize the roaming photographers). And dodon't forget to have the staff at each ride (where your photos are taken. I.e. Hyperspace mountain) scan your photopass card to save your photo.5. AVOID the souvenir shops (unless you really want to buy a souvenir or two), these will take a lot of your time especially if you are with kids.6. Check out klook.com and the hk disneyland website for promo day passes and 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 meal coupons (these coupons are cheaper compared to buying food ala carte). Compare the prices on the websites before purchasing.7. Plan your day ahead. Look at the map and schedules available on the HK disneyland app or website.8. Try to watch both the afternoon parade and the night parade (around 8pm).9. ENJOY YOUR DAY!P.S. the staff strickly enforce the  no outside food policy . But they are lenient with water bottles and baby formula. Bring a water bottle or two (Bottled water is expensive inside the theme park. There are drinking fountains around the theme park and HK tap water is potable, but you can taste the chlorine.)",5
It was our first visit to Disneyland and it was simply magical. We enjoyed taking pictures with the various Disney characters. The rides are good for small kids but not good enough for accompanying adults. But my 5 yr old loved every bit of it. It is almost 3 months now that we are back and my daughter still longs to go back to Disneyland!!,5
"We had a wonderful time. Our visit was in late June through the first week of July. The crowds were only an issue in the evening waiting for the parade, but that's to be expected.",5
"Travellers... use sunblock, hat and sunglasses. Take pics with you fav disney characters. And play the attractions. Download HK Disneyland apps. It will inform you waiting time for every each attraction. It helps!! And dont forget to buy disney merchandise at main street. And the most important thing is to have fun with your family or friends. ",5
Its really nice play ground for all if us. You can meet lot of Disney characters.The train rides getting to Disney were fun.,5
"As a silver pass holder, I enjoy come about 5 6pm with friend and stay still closed. Avoid to bring heavy stuffs and pay $100 locker rental. Eat before going in. Shop souvenirs first and check for bargain deal. Send what you bought to the front gate concerige but I havedon't used this service. Go into early morning but skip first 30mins avoid long Q. Love Disneyland always.",5
"Brilliant, from setting off from Causeway Bay to arriving at Disneyland. Last part of journey was on the Disney train.Not as busy as Florida's Disneyworld so more chance of going on all the rides when you want to.Has a lot of the razzamataz of Disneyworld.We have visited on two occasions, and enjoyed both equally. Try it, you wodon't be disappointed.",5
The train rides getting to Disney were fun. I spent most of my time at the Star Wars area. Well....because it's Star Wars duh! Went there with my brother and kid. Surprisingly my little boy enjoyed the Elsa meet and greet. Food and merchandise are madly expensive though.,5
"After having visited Shanghai Disneyland a few days prior (it was just  meh ), Hong Kong Disneyland was a welcome respite! Lines were short, fast passes were readily available (though unnecessary), facilities (Park and Explorer's Lodge Hotel) were immaculate, and Cast Members exuded the Disney magic! Our longest wait time of the day was 20 minutes for RC Racer. We did Hyper Space Mountain, Iron Man, Mystic Manor, and Grizzly Gulch multiple times. We Fastpassed Winnie the Pooh, just for the sake of doing a Fastpass, but it really wasdon't necessary as the hotel had given us 6 priority access passes. We only used 4 of the priority passes throughout the day. Lines were orderly and the Park was very clean. The food offerings at the Park were quite good too! We tried for the Mango Dole Whip at Jessie's Snack Roundup, but they diddon't seem to carry it any longer. Instead we had the pineapple smoothie with ice cream and a churro on the side. Both were very good! We ate at the Starliner Diner for lunch, it's typical Disney quick service.We took a cab from HKG to Explorer's Lodge, but took the MTR back into the city after our Disney visit. The cab was around 145 HKD, while the MTR to the city was around 60 HKD (2 adults and one child).Like most Disney Parks (except Shanghai Disney), we were truly sad to leave Hong Kong Disneyland, and hope to be back soon!",5
"Its really really nice play ground for all if us. Me my sisters my brother in law my Mom n my niece. We are having a great time 2 play there. The staff ia so humble n nice with us. Many cool atraction 2 c,can wait 2 back there ",5
Huge place for the smallest Disneyland in the world. So much magic! The kids absolutely loved it and even us teens adults!,5
We did a previous review of HKD and its Explorer Lodge.  We had a great time and would go back for sure in two or three years.  Highly Recommened.,5
"There are variety attractions for all ages; extreme rides in Toy Story, fun train ride around the park, meet and greet with the characters and a lot more. Best bonding for the family.",5
Hong Kong Disneyland is absolutely a wonderful place for all ages.It's 15 minutes away from the airport using a taxi. You have to use the blue taxi by the way because it's cheaper. The food is kinda expensive compared if you eat at the airport. One day is not enough to visit this place as we came only for a 12 hour layover prior to our destination country. The night parade is so AMAZING! This makes me wana visit another Disneyland on our next trip.,5
"This place will make you forget your problems. Go around and be patient on queuing for the rides. The queuing will take most of your time. The Fantasyland is the best, next is the Tomorrowland and the Magical shows. Inside Disneyland, there are good enough restaurants, food prices are of course high. Comfort rooms are airconditioned, so that as you go around, you will find comfort in their comfort rooms. The only thing that is a drawback was the comfort rooms were not consistently attended to by janitors because most of these smelled of urine. It was a Tuesday when we went there, expectedly there were not too many people but alas, there were a lot of guests. Nevertheless, I'm giving two thumb up to this place. The Parade of Lights and Firecrackers show were worth the wait and the visit. Never miss these events happening at 9:15 PM everyday.",5
"My daughter, 23 years old went with me to Hongkong just wanted to go to Disneyland. I was on a work trip to Shenzhen.I didnt know i will also enjoy the place and be amazed at the attractions. The Finale, the fireworks and the reflections of Disney movies shown at the facade of the castle melted my heart... now i want to go back again.. with my Grandchild Addie :) Happiest Place on Earth.",5
"went to disneyland to celebrate my borth that was last july 31, 2017 and oh boy its so hot and humide but i really waited for mickey and minnie just to have a picture with them because the last time i went in disneyland i was not able to have a picture with them. but this time i really endure the hot day and it was a dream come true",5
"We went there with 5 kids and 4 adults. It was lots of fun. You can go with even small kids to good rides, for most of the rides you just have to be 1.04m. Stay until the parade around 4pm. Its great and you see all the stars like M.Mouse, Timon&Pumba, Toy Story etc",5
We went there September and the weather is hot but not so hot around 25C but it's fine. There's still wind as you wander around the Disney. It's like we're kids again and our favorite part was the Disney fireworks. Food is expensive and other rides is until 5 6pm so check out the schedule so you wodon't miss anything. HK Disney is small but all in all experience is amazing.,5
one of best place i visited in neally two days it was like dream my daughter enjoy there especially night show,5
Disneyland will really make you go back to ur childhood days. It was awesome to see Snow White and Mickey Mouse. It will make u proud as well to see Filipinos performing in the parade. Just that the price of the food inside the park are not reasonable.,5
"We visited Hong Kong Disneyland and it was just an amazing time. The park is smaller than those in Paris and Tokyo however, it was still in line with the wonderful Disney experience. The park also has loads of special offers and special discounts that you can find by signing up on their free Wifi service and staff members handing out coupons. The only downside was that we purchased a dining plan and although the  fine print  says that you can use it for ice pops at carts around the park, management failed to provide the staff at the cards with the equipment necessary to process the QR coded vouchers.",5
"Celebrated my younger brother's birthday in the happiest place on earth! It was raining that day but we purchased raincoats outside of Disneyland   check weather forecasts prior for maximum fun and savings. The kids wodon't care if they get wet during the rides, nobody's raining on their parade! The disney staff were giving away stickers to little kids too.. ",5
"Came to Hong Kong to see Disneyland. Although it is not as large as the parks in America, we had a wonderful time. The day started with monsoon like rain that cooled off the weather for a while. We were able to see ride all the attractions without the outrageous lines in the USA. The Lion King and Mickeys Wonderous Book had exceptional live performers, especially Elsa. She sounded just like the movie",5
We had a absolute amazing time here and I highly recommend it for young families. To get the full feel of the park I would suggest two days so kids can have a couple turns on the rides. We did a morning to early afternoon for the first day and then a late afternoon till the end of night fireworks the second day and it was well worth it. International travellers should definitely take advantage staying at one of the 3 resorts which offer free shuttles all day long.,5
Another great attraction in Hong Kong to visit especially if you have children      it's so simple to get there independently also on the mtr you just need to change once onto the special Disney train as you can imagine there is loads to do,5
I have been to Walt Disney World in Orlando since I was 7 years old until I was 39 years old and HK's Disneyland was agreat stop for me at the age of 46. Never stop dreaming!,5
Always love to go to disneyland. But this time disneyland with hong kong culture. Too bad because we dodon't understand the language most of the time. But still we had fuuuunnnn :D,5
"You need to spend at least one day to enjoy a little bit of everything in this magical place. To avoid queue in the ticket line, we booked our tickets at klook.com with discount.",5
"Took the Metro from hotel to Disney. You take the Metro to the Disney line   then get on trains that are decked out with Mickey Ears windows and Disney character statues inside the train. Our car was covered in blue fabric with white walls. Very clean and fun for all to experience.Arrive at Disney and walk to the entrance    with security checks before entry to the park. As we were seniors, we got the cheapest rate in HK$. We felt this price is cheaper than what we pay to enter the parks at Disneyland or DisneyWorld.We were amazed at how clean the park was    how friendly the people were and because we were American's, everyone wanted to take their photo with us. Cell phones are everywhere. Seem to be glued to their hands, just like here in America! So now we are in lots of photo albums there in China!There are a few Disney characters who come out   but be warned they dodon't do autographs. Pin trading is something new to them so not many people trade; however, the Disney crew did have the lanyards for those of us who are traders! The majority of the pins were what you see at the US parks, but we were able to chat with a few crew and one of them was a trader who traded a really nice pin she had collected for one of ours that we had brought with us. So it was fun.Duffy is the popular character it seems    but that might be because Easter. Spring and Easter was the theme parks decor while we were there.It rained off and on that day but the weather was hot, so the brief showers brought out umbrellas, of which we had none, so we just walked around in the rain to cool off! Went on 2 rides, walked around to enjoy the experience and ate lunch before leaving the park about 3 to take the metro back to the hotel.A great place for kids of all ages naturally, but there were a lot of families there with young children and teens out on Spring break, Also we as senior kids!There is a Pandora charm store on location with all the Disney Pandora charms available for purchase.",5
"Yes, it's smaller than most Disney's you have been to. BUT it makes up for it. It wasdon't busy at all when we went and we were able to do everything we wanted to do TWICE! The grizzly bear ride was amazing!!! Hyper space mountain was killer. I recommend doing this. Especially if you're a Disney freak like I am! Make sure you get treats from the confectionary. They have really yummy treats you dodon't get to try in America.",5
We had full masti for the time we were in disneyland. We were dropped at the gate by our travel guide and had less than 12 hrs to explore it and make the best of it. The tips dat i cud quote which we used in this travel are1) we took out the complete map of disneyland and decided the approx time we wanted to spend in each area.2) although u wish to stay n breathe n njoy the surroundings but i promise u vl miss on alot of stuff so Rush!!3) u should not at all wear high heels or ne sort of uncomfortable boots or heels and must carry small racksacks (shoulder bags) for water n stff. Wear smthng cool n smart.4) we are pure vegetarians so by majboori we had no tym to waste on tryng food stfs5) enter ur first choice from right or left. It is tomorrowland or main street usa resp. I vl prfr tomorrowland cz u vl wsh fr sm small rides n nice views and then u cn follow the road.6) best part  spread.. we made our parents stand separately in queues of different rides so dat on njoyng one we cd run for another. Also one shd avoid rushy areas.. i.e. Dnt enter whr rush is entering. After sometime you will find it a lot easier space to njoy.DONT WASTE TYMDo njoy the night show. Dnt wrry abt takng d frst place near the boundary lines of the castle.. its fire crackers so focus on wats happng overhead,5
Hong Kong Disneyland is fantastic! It captures all of the traditional Disney elements whilst also putting it's own spin on things. The park is incredibly easy to navigate and well set out.Waits times are sooooooo much less here than at other Disneyland Resorts around the World. Definitely if you want short queues and be able to experience all that Disneyland has to offer then the best bet would be to make a trip to Hong Kong Disneyland you wodon't be disappointed!!,5
Excellent place with whole day long full of entertainment. Must go recommended place in HK for the family with kids.,5
"Disneyland was indeed the happiest place I've been when I was in Hongkong. Although it was quite far from the place we were staying still, I enjoyed so much even from the start of the travel. They had their own Disney train where you can sit in a luxurious seat. The place was amazing. It would bring back childhood memories and it would cast away your worries. Parade of colors were nice. We actually witnessed two parades, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The fireworks were definitely wonderful. A place where there's no time to get bored. Definitely a happy place for family and friends... ",5
Great rides and loads of fun  But the heat and sun simply fries you alive.. all the walking makes you really tired..   Halal food is a real change.. there is one halal restaurent but was closed on the day I visited..,5
This time around it was just me and the hubbie! I really wanted to come here just for the fireworks!!! As part of my bday weekend celebration!!! And I dodon't care about the ticket cost and all and not going for rides and expensive food all around because just the priceless feeling of seeing the night parade with all the exploding lights and sounds and of course the amazing fireworks show is all worth it!!!Also it's quite easy to get here ... HK's metro system is very very efficient!!! ,5
"Lots of rides, lots of kids show like story telling, fireworks are here. A large shopping complex is here. Really great funland it is.It is built in a large property. A lot of restaurants are here having different favoured food.",5
"Need extra energy to explore and to play in this park. During summer time really needs to have an umbrella, hats or anti UV jacket. It's not allowed to bring any food and there's a security check at the gate. You can ride on the train when you feel tired and need time to recharge your energy. Just sit, relax and enjoy the park. Variety of food is available there. You can try the Disney's MTR and see the uniqueness. Never too old to have fun there. And dodon't miss the spectacular fireworks start at 9pm. Find your strategic spot to enjoy the parade and fireworks ",5
"You dodon't have to be a child to enjoy Disneyland. In my 7th visit to a Disney Resort, this time in Hong Kong, I was with a group of five office mates who momentarily forgot they were not kids anymore. Or they simply dodon't care because, after all, they are in the happiest place on Earth.While the HK Disneyland is the smallest among the different Disney Resorts around the world, it still pays to be early to beat the crowd. Visit Disney on a weekday when there are fewer visitors (but dodon't underestimate the word 'fewer'). It is best to be in front of the ticket booths before 9:30AM so that you can join the impatient visitors who make a mad dash to the nearest attractions once they open at 10AM. And that's exactly what we did. Tomorrowland (Space Mountain, Iron Man, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters in succession). Then off to Toy Story Land (Toy Soldier Parachute Drop, RC Racer Roller Coaster, Slinky Dog Spin) , then to Grizzly Gulch (Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (my favorite!). So many more rides, so little time.Dodon't forget to watch The Lion King Show (various times), Philharmagic (4D), the Disney Characters Parade at 4:00PM, the Light the Night Parade at 8:00PM, and the Fireworks Display at 9:00PM.At P3,800  (HK$589), a one full day trip to Disneyland will always be worth every peso (or dollar) you pay.",5
